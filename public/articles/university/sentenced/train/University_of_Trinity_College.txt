<p> &lt;!--<a>right|thumb|350px|Trinity College main building</a> --&gt; The <strong>University of Trinity College</strong>, referred to locally as <strong>Trinity College, Toronto</strong> or <strong>Trin</strong>, is the smallest <a>federated college</a> of the <a>University of Toronto</a>, with 1820 undergraduate students.
Trinity also houses an <a>Anglican</a> <a>divinity school</a> with 138 students, and is a constituent member of the <a>Toronto School of Theology</a>.</p>
<p>Trinity maintains very high academic standards for undergraduates.
Between 2005 and 2009, <a>Ontario</a> students entering Trinity had an academic average of 92 per cent, and of the seven colleges at the University of Toronto, Trinity has the highest proportion of students who graduate with &quot;Distinction&quot; or with &quot;High Distinction&quot;.
and the college has produced 35 <a>Rhodes Scholars</a> since its inception.
The college maintains <a>Oxbridge</a>-style traditions which reflect its <a>English</a> roots, including the mandatory wearing of <a>gowns</a> at dinner, a <a>chapel choir</a> comprised partially of paid <a>choral scholar</a>s, but the student body is nonetheless diverse, with nearly 25% of undergraduates coming from 60 countries outside Canada.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>right|thumb|280px|Trinity College circa 1852, referred to as Old Trin</a></p>
<h3>Founding</h3>
<p>In 1827, Bishop <a>John Strachan</a>, an <a>Anglican</a> priest and Archdeacon of York who arrived in <a>Canada</a> in 1799, received a Royal Charter from <a>King George IV</a> to build King's College at York (now <a>Toronto</a>).
At the time the <a>British Empire</a> was being reformed along financial and religious lines, and one of the goals of the &quot;new system&quot; was to form churches (by way of land grants) and schools in all of the colonies.
However, York was so small at the time that there were no funds available for actually building the college, and the first classes were not held until 1843.
This was supplanted by a Royal Charter for Trinity University, granted by <a>Queen Victoria</a> in 1852.
The first Provost, <a>George Whitaker</a>, was appointed in 1852, holding office until 1880.
In 1884 the college admitted its first woman student; in 1888, <a>St.
Hilda's College</a> was created for the women students of Trinity.</p>
<h3>Federation with the University of Toronto</h3>
<p>&lt;!--<a>right|thumb|250px|The Gates of Old Trin, circa 2000</a>--&gt; <a>left|thumb|205px|Trinity College main building</a></p>
<p>By withdrawing financial support, the Ontario government pressured its denominational universities to consider co-operation with the public sector in 1868.
With Strachan now long dead, efforts began in the 1890s to unite Trinity with the University of Toronto.
The matter was hotly contested.
However, the college federated with the university in 1904.
From the union, Trinity was to gain the financial security of the larger institution and access to a top notch science school, and a decent arts faculty.
The University of Toronto was to gain a state of the art faculty of medicine as well as a traditional Oxbridge collegiate community.
Bishop <a>James Fielding Sweeny</a> laid the cornerstone  and the architects were <a>Pearson and Darling</a>.
The new building was opened in 1925, at which point the land and original building were sold to the city, then later torn down in 1950.
Only the old gates of the college still stand, at the southern entrance to <a>Trinity Bellwoods Park</a> on <a>Queen Street West</a>.
The former women's residence building for St. Hilda's students is now a home for senior citizens and overlooks the northern end of the park from the west side.</p>
<p>The policy of university education initiated in the 1960s responded to population pressure and the belief that higher education was a key to social justice and economic productivity for individuals and for society.</p>
<p>A plaque was erected by the Toronto Historical Board in 1988.
</p>
<h3>Recent history</h3>
<p>In the latter part of the twentieth century, the place of longstanding institutions and traditions within the college community has changed in the face of both internal and external criticism.
By October 1992, <a>Episkopon</a>, present within the college since 1858, was officially dissociated from Trinity.
Likewise, in 2004 the college board of trustees voted narrowly in favour of ending Trinity's long practice of same-sex residency, and beginning in 2005 large portions of Trinity's residences became home to both men and women, although still separated by houses or wings.</p>
<h2>Buildings and environs</h2>
<p><a>left|350px|thumb|Main building of Trinity College, southern facade on Hoskin Ave.</a></p>
<h3>Main Building</h3>
<p>The southern facade of Trinity's main building on Hoskin Avenue (seen in photo) was constructed in 1925, and was modeled on the 1851 old building at Trinity Bellwoods Park by <a>Kivas Tully</a>.
The design of the main building is by <a>Darling and Pearson</a>, a noted Toronto architectural firm which constructed a number of other buildings on the University of Toronto campus including <a>Convocation Hall</a> and <a>Varsity Arena</a>.
A 1941 addition by architects firm <a>George and Moorhouse</a> saw the construction of the west academic wing, which includes many of the College's public rooms, and the east residence wing.
After the Chapel was constructed in 1955 (see section <a>Chapel</a>), the College's final wing to the north was added in 1961 by architects <a>Somerville, McMurrich and Oxley</a>, completing the enclosed quadrangle.
The architectural style of the main building is <a>Gothic Revival</a>, with elements of <a>Jacobethan</a> (particularly in the roofline and towers on the south wing) and <a>Tudor Revival</a> (in the Angel's Roost tower).</p>
<p>The main building of Trinity College sits across Hoskin Avenue from <a>Wycliffe College</a>, the <a>low church</a> <a>Anglican</a> seminary, and is primarily connected to the main University campus via a pathway underneath <a>Soldiers' Tower</a> on the west end of <a>Hart House</a>.</p>
<h3>St.
Hilda&#x2019;s College</h3>
<p>In 1888, it was decided that a distinct college was required for the women of Trinity, the first of whom had been admitted in 1884.
St. Hilda's College occupied a number of buildings around Toronto, including on the main Trinity College grounds on Queen Street in present-day <a>Trinity Bellwoods Park</a>.
In 1938, St. Hilda's moved into to site on Devonshire Place which it still occupies, west of the main Trinity building and the Larkin building.
This, along with the erection of the Chapel in 1883, created east and west wings of the college.
Thus in 1903 it was held that Trinity was deserving of a significant expansion to the north, forming a double quadrangle found throughout the constituent <a>Oxbridge</a> colleges.
Early in its life, the site was once home to the largest outdoor Shakespeare festival in the country.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2007, the quadrangle was renovated with money from an anonymous donor.
The new design features flagstone paths, replacing the former asphalt paths, as well as the Greek letter <a>Chi</a> (X), also the character for Christ, writ large in intricate flagstones.</p>
<p><a>left|thumb|200px|Trinity Chapel seen from the entrance</a></p>
<h3>Chapel</h3>
<p>The Trinity College Chapel was built with funds donated by the late Gerald Larkin (1885&#x2013;1961), who headed the Salada Tea Company from 1922 to 1957.
He contracted the renowned English architect, <a>Sir Giles Gilbert Scott</a>, who designed the great <a>Gothic</a> <a>Liverpool Cathedral</a> and the ubiquitous <a>red telephone box</a>es seen throughout the UK.</p>
<p>Built in the modified perpendicular Gothic style, the main chapel extends  to the reredos and is  high at the vault bosses.
The hall was erected in 1941, immediately prior to war-time restrictions on building materials.</p>
<p>This dress code and other points of etiquette are enforced by the second year students, led by the male and female heads of second year.
The second year students act as &#x201c;deputies of the hall&#x201d; and are in charge of enforcing the dress code as well as maintaining discipline during the meal.
Any student in violation of the dress code will not be allowed to enter the hall until they are dressed appropriately; this regulation is relaxed for non-resident students.
The second year students also have the authority to physically eject any student who causes a ruckus during the meal.</p>
<p>In parody of the college&#x2019;s <a>Oxbridge</a> traditions, the first year students will occasionally disrupt the formality of the meal by hurling buns at their fellow undergraduates.
When this occurs, it is the job of the second years to eject all offending first years, or occasionally fellow upper years, from the hall.
This is generally done with much struggle, however with little injury to any of the parties concerned.
As the artillery is traditionally limited to simple <a>bread rolls</a>, no significant damage results from these incidents.</p>
<p>This room was also used in the filming of the movie <a>Searching for Bobby Fischer</a>.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<h3>Profile</h3>
<p><a>right|thumb|250px|Munk Centre for International Studies (north wing)</a> Trinity's student body consists of approximately 1700 undergraduate students, with a first-year enrollment limited to 400 Arts &amp; Science students, and 140 Divinity students.
Students are admitted to Trinity in line with the common framework (with the exception of the Faculty of Divinity) of the University of Toronto Colleges adhere to, which lays down the principles and procedures for admission to the University of Toronto, which they all observe.
Trinity maintains a tradition of academic success, with thirty-five of its graduates having been awarded Rhodes Scholarships.
From 2005-06 to 2009-10, Trinity's first-year class had an Ontario secondary school academic average of 90.9 percent.</p>
<p>The college has two active academic faculties, that of Arts and that of Divinity.
Trinity maintains its university status by maintaining a doctoral program in the latter faculty.</p>
<h3>Undergraduate</h3>
<p>The Faculty of Arts offers undergraduate major programs in <a>Immunology</a>, <a>International Relations</a> (IR), and Ethics, Society, and Law (ES&amp;L) to students at U of T. Associated with the latter two is an academic program called Trinity One.
Admission to the Trinity One program is separate from that of the college itself, with enrollment limited to 25 students per stream.
At least one prominent professor teaches in each stream; for example, <a>Robert Bothwell</a> in the International Relations stream <a>Mark Kingwell</a> in Ethics, Society, and Law.
Noted author <a>Margaret MacMillan</a> taught in the International Relations stream for the first two years of the program, prior to her departure for <a>Oxford</a>.</code></p>
<h3>John W. Graham Library</h3>
<p>The John W. Graham Library embodies nearly two centuries of vision, energy, and commitment to the academic enterprise of Trinity College.
Its roots go back to 1828, when John Strachan secured a collection of some four hundred books from the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge to stock the library of his fledgling university.
Today the Graham Library is located in the Munk Centre for International Studies (formerly Devonshire House), occupying a heritage building renewed for the 21st-century, with 200,000 volumes, convenient technological resources, and fine study spaces.
The Library serves primarily Trinity's undergraduate Arts and Science students, the graduate Divinity students and faculty of Trinity and Wycliffe Colleges, and the greater University of Toronto and Anglican Church communities who seek our resources.
Subject strengths reflect the academic programs and interests of the two colleges: e.g., international relations, ethics, literature in English, philosophy, theology, Anglican church history, biblical studies.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<p><a>right|thumb|150px|The choir loft</a></p>
<h3>Chapel Choir</h3>
<p>The Trinity College Chapel Choir, which grew out of the Trinity Choral Club established in the 1890s, A Director of Music conducts the choir, mentors the organ scholar, and occasionally plays the organ during services.
Since 2006, the Director of Music has been <a>John Tuttle</a>, who is also Professor of Organ at the Faculty of Music, Choirmaster and Organist at <a>St.
Thomas's Anglican Church</a>, and Conductor of the Exultate Chamber Singers.</p>
<h3>Dramatic Society</h3>
<p>The Trinity College Dramatic Society (TCDS) was established in 1892, and since 1927 has put on at least one full-length production each year.
In some years, an additional two or three short plays have also been produced.
The TCDS used <a>Hart House</a> as a performance venue from 1921 until 1979, when the <a>George Ignatieff</a> Theatre (GIT) was constructed at Trinity.
While most productions are now in the GIT, plays have also been staged in other rooms at Trinity and outside in the quadrangle.</p>
<h3>Episkopon</h3>
<p> Episkopon is a controversial <a>secret society</a> at Trinity, with a male branch founded in 1858 and a female branch founded in 1899.
Despite many years as an official student organization at Trinity, Episkopon was censured and forcibly disassociated from the College in 1992, following allegations of racism and homophobia.
Episkopon presents three annual &quot;readings&quot;, during which Trinity students assemble to hear gossip and criticism of students in the form of jokes, songs, and poems. in 1993, Trinity alumnus <a>Declan Hill</a> argued in a <a>CBC Radio</a> documentary that Episkopon ridicules certain groups and actions as a form of social control;</p>
<h3>James Bond Society</h3>
<p>The Trinity College James Bond Society was founded in 1997 to promote the appreciation of <a>James Bond</a>.
Each year, the Society holds several pre-dinner receptions where <a>martinis</a> are served Bond-style: <a>shaken, not stirred</a>; after dinner, a Bond movie is shown.
<a>Black tie</a> is the required dress at all James Bond Society events.</p>
<p><a>right|thumb|150px|Attendance at a Lit debate</a></p>
<h3>Literary Institute</h3>
<p>The Trinity College Literary Institute (&quot;the Lit&quot;) predates Trinity, and was moved there from the Diocesan Theological Institute in 1852.
The Lit holds weekly <a>satirical</a> debates on humorous topics, often based on upcoming holidays or College events, and occasionally holds &quot;serious debates&quot;.
The Lit also convenes a Competitive Debating Committee that provides training in <a>parliamentary debate</a>, hosts weekly debates for members, and sends teams to tournaments of the <a>Canadian University Society for Intercollegiate Debate</a>.</p>
<h3>Student government</h3>
<p>At Trinity, the final <a>student government</a> authority is the Trinity College Meeting (TCM), a <a>direct democracy</a> body in which all students have equal standing (conditional on the wearing of <a>gowns</a> at meetings).
The TCM directly governs major policy questions and the allocation of student funds, but also convenes committees responsible for specific topics.
As well, the TCM delegates responsibility for daily affairs to eight student Heads, following annual elections.
There are two Heads of College, two Heads of Non-Residents, two Heads of Arts (social) and two Heads of Divinity; in each case, one Head is female and one male.
The current Student Heads are: Stefan Tarnawsky, Head of College; Melinda Jacobs, Head of St Hilda's College; Jonathan Scott, Head of Non-Residents; Haley Turnbull, Head of Non-Residents; Ian Sutcliffe, Head of Arts; Caroline Ross, Head of Arts; <a>Maggie Helwig</a> and Jesse Parker, Co-heads of Divinity.</p>
<h3>Student publications</h3>
<p>Trinity students publish a newspaper called <em>The Salterrae</em> (<a>Latin</a>, meaning <em>Salt of the Earth</em>) which was founded as <em>Trinlight</em> in 1981.
The annual <a>yearbook</a> is <em>Stephanos</em> (<a>Greek</a>, meaning <em>Crown</em>).
There is also a bi-annual journal of students' short stories, photographs and poetry, called the <em>Trinity University Review</em>; it was first published in 1880 as <em>Rouge et Noir</em> (<a>French</a>, meaning <em>Red and Black</em>).</p>
<h2>Film and fiction</h2>
<p><a>right|thumb|100px|Davies&#x2019; novel <em>The Rebel Angels</em></a> Trinity College is believed by many to be the setting of <a>Robertson Davies</a>&#x2019; novel <em><a>The Rebel Angels</a></em>.
Evidence includes the similarities between Trinity and the fictional College described in the text; the fact that Davies taught at Trinity for 20 years while living across the street at <a>Massey College</a>; and that a picture of Trinity's central tower is prominently featured on the cover of the novel's first edition (seen right).</p>
<p>The Trinity College campus has served as the filming set for scenes in many movies and television series, including <em><a>Searching for Bobby Fischer</a></em>, <em><a>The Skulls</a></em>, <em><a>Tommy Boy</a></em>, <em><a>Moonlight and Valentino</a></em>, <em><a>Class of '96</a></em>, <em><a>TekWar</a></em>, and <em><a>Ararat</a></em>.</p>
