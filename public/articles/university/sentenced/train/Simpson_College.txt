<h3>Greek Life</h3>
<p>Simpson College has a deep-rooted Greek life history.
It is home to seven <a>Greek organizations</a>: three national fraternities; <a>Sigma Alpha Epsilon</a>, <a>Alpha Tau Omega</a>, <a>Lambda Chi Alpha</a>,one local fraternity; Kappa Theta Psi, and three national sororities; <a>Kappa Kappa Gamma</a>, <a>Pi Beta Phi</a>, and <a>Delta Delta Delta</a>.</p>
<p><a>Alpha Tau Omega</a> (ATO) is the oldest fraternity on campus, tracing its history at Simpson back to 1885.
The fraternity is known nationally as the &quot;leadership development fraternity&quot;.
After briefly being shut down along with 3 other fraternities on campus in the 1890s, ATO was rechartered in 1905 and has been in continual existence ever since.
The Simpson College ATO chapter has produced many prominent names at the school.
Nick Ackerman, the wrestler who the Division III national championship despite having no legs, was an ATO, as were some of the most prominent names at Simpson College, including Bill Buxton, Bill Buxton, Jr. and James Weinman, all of whom have facilities on campus named in their honor.
In Oct. 2010, ATO will celebrate its 125th year on campus.</p>
<p><a>Sigma Alpha Epsilon</a> (SAE), founded in 1889, is the second oldest fraternity on campus.
It is currently the largest fraternity on campus in terms of members.
The men of SAE pride themselves on living by the code of &quot;The True Gentlemen.&quot;</p>
<p>Kappa Theta Psi (KOY) is the oldest local fraternity west of the Mississippi.
It was founded in 1902, shortly after a time when four other fraternities on campus (including ATO and SAE) had been shut down due to anti-Greek sentiment.
After the quest for a national re-charter from SAE failed, KOY existed for many years as only a local fraternity.
After the chapter was nationally chartered in 1969 as an Upsilon Delta chapter and subsequently was shut down by nationals and by Simpson college, KOY returned to campus in 1979.
The fraternity saw much success in the 1980s and 1990s, but membership died off in the 2000s and KOY was removed from their house on fraternity row.
They currently have a house a couple of blocks from fraternity row, being the only fraternity on campus not located on fraternity row.</p>
<p><a>Lambda Chi Alpha</a> (Lambda) traces its roots at Simpson to 1924.&lt;ref name=&quot;simpson_college_greek_life&quot;/&gt;  Recently, Lambda has become known on campus for having many members involved in music and theater at Simpson.
LXA is one of the leading fraternities on Simpson campus for scholastic achievement.</p>
<p><a>Pi Beta Phi</a> (Pi Phi) is Simpson's oldest Greek organization.
Pi Phi has been at Simpson since 1874.&lt;ref
name=&quot;simpson_college_greek_life&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p><a>Kappa Kappa Gamma</a> (KKG) was on Simpson's campus for nine years between 1880 and 1889.
After a 100-year absence, it was re-established in 1989.&lt;ref
name=&quot;simpson_college_greek_life&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p><a>Delta Delta Delta</a> (DDD or Tri-Delta) has been at Simpson since 1889 and is the longest running Tri-Delta chapter in the nation.&lt;ref
name=&quot;simpson_college_greek_life&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p><a>Alpha Chi Omega</a> (AXO) sorority also had a Simpson College chapter for over 100 years, before it closed its doors in the early 2000s.</p>
<h3>150th Anniversary</h3>
<p>Sept.
28, 2010 marked the 150th anniversary of Simpson's establishment as an educational institution, being the anniversary of the first day classes were held at the school.
To celebrate the event, current students and alumni were invited to attend a picnic in the center of campus, out in front of Carver Science Hall.
Following the picnic, a time capsule was buried containing pictures and other memorabilia submitted by students.
The capsule will be uncovered in 2060, on Simpson's 200th anniversary.</p>
<p>Another current issue at Simpson College has been the construction of a new student center.
The current hub for student activities, Brenton Student Center (BSC), is small and according to the architects that have been contracted to build a new student center, one of the ten most poorly designed buildings in the country.
The BSC has 32 different levels in it and is poorly equipped for handicapped usage.
The planned design for the new student center would reduce the building to just 3 levels and would nearly double the size of the building.
The groundbreaking for the project is planned for spring 2011, but is still tentative at this point.
A new student center was originally supposed to be built next to what is currently Buxton Park, but plans for its construction were shelved just before groundbreaking.
The student center serves as host to numerous CAB events, contains the campus mailroom, radio station, some class rooms, and residence life and security offices.
It's also home to the Storm Street Grill, which offers a dining alternative to the Pfeiffer Dining Hall.</p>
