<p> <strong>Eastern Michigan University</strong> is a comprehensive, co-educational <a>public university</a> located in <a>Ypsilanti, Michigan</a>.
The university is governed by an eight-member Board of Regents, who are appointed by the Governor of Michigan for eight-year terms.
The school belongs to the <a>Mid-American Conference</a> and was re-accredited by the North Central Association in 2001.
Currently, EMU comprises five colleges: Arts &amp; Sciences, Business, Education, Health &amp; Human Services, Technology and a Graduate School.
Since 1991 its mascot has been the Eagle.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|200px|right|University Park on campus, in the background is the Rec/IM center.
On the far right (slightly in view) is the Student Center.</a>
The university was founded in 1849 as <strong>Michigan State Normal School</strong>, the first in Michigan and the first <a>normal school</a> created outside the original 13 colonies.
Michigan created a state educational system modeled on that of Germany.
The normal schools were to train teachers for common schools, which were being established rapidly in new towns in the state.
In 1899, it became the <strong>Michigan State Normal College</strong> when it created the first four-year curriculum for a normal college in the nation.
With the additions of departments, it became  <strong>Eastern Michigan College</strong> in 1956, and finally <strong>Eastern Michigan University</strong> in 1959.
Education, Arts and Sciences and the Graduate School were the first three colleges in the newly created university.
Several major expansions followed shortly afterward, including the addition of the College of Business in 1964, the College of Health and Human Services in 1975 and the College of Technology in 1980.
More recently, extended programs were added such as Continuing Education, the Centers for Corporate Training, the World College and numerous community-focused institutes.
</p>
<p>Physically, the campus has grown with the construction of the Terrestrial and Aquatic Research Facility (1998), the <a>Convocation Center</a> (1998), the Bruce T. Halle Library (1998), the John W. Porter College of Education Building (1999), the Everett L. Marshall College of Health and Human Services Building (2000), the Village residence hall (2001) and University House (2003).
A new Student Center opened in 2006 replacing McKenny Union.
After the Student Center opening, Mckenny Hall went through a renovation to preserve the buildings old style.

<p>Total student population averages about 23,000, of whom roughly 5,000 are graduate students.
Most programs are undergraduate or master's level, although the university has doctoral programs in Educational Leadership, Technology, and Psychology.
Susan W. Martin, Ph.D., took office as EMU's twenty-second president on July 7, 2008.
Her predecessor, John Fallon III, Ph.D., was dismissed on July 15, 2007 by the Board of Regents due to his handling of the <a>Laura Dickinson</a> incident.
In the fall of 2009 EMU received positive publicity for its proactive approach in its handling H1N1.
In 2010, Eastern was in the news for its decision not to raise tuition rates for the 2010&#x2013;2011 school year.</p>

<h3>Nicknames</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|Before the adoption of the Huron logo in 1929, the school used a block M with the word &quot;Normal&quot; to signify Michigan State Normal College.</a>
<a>thumb|140px|right|Eastern Michigan University ended the use of the Huron logo in 1991.</a>
Since the 1991 season, Eastern Michigan University athletic teams have gone by the nickname &quot;Eagles.&quot;
EMU, then called Michigan State Normal College, originally went by the nicknames &quot;Normalites&quot; and &quot;Men from Ypsi&quot; and various other titles down through the years before &quot;Hurons&quot; was adopted in 1929.
The &quot;Hurons&quot; first came into being as the result of a contest sponsored by the Men's Union in 1929.
On Oct. 31 of that year, a three-person committee, composed of Dr. Clyde Ford, Dr. Elmer Lyman and Professor Bert Peet, selected the name &quot;Hurons&quot; from the many entries in the contest.
The name was submitted by two students, Gretchen Borst and George Hanner.
The runner-up name in that contest was Pioneers.</p>
<p>EMU began investigating the appropriateness of its Huron Indian logo after the Michigan Department of Civil Rights issued a report in October 1988 suggesting that all schools using such logos drop them.
The report indicated that the use of Native American names, logos and mascots for athletic teams promoted racial stereotypes.
At that time, four colleges, 62 high schools and 33 junior high/middle schools in Michigan used Native American logos or names, including <a>Mid-American Conference</a> rival <a>Central Michigan University</a>.
CMU did not, however, change their nickname from the Chippewas.
The EMU Board of Regents voted to replace the Huron name with Eagles, taken from three recommendations from a committee charged with supplying a new nickname.
The other two final names submitted were Green Hornets and Express.
The Eagles name was officially adopted on May 22, 1991, when the EMU Board of Regents voted to replace the existing Huron nickname and logo with the new one.
During the <a>1991 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament</a>, announcer <a>Brent Musburger</a> talked about the controversy and referred to the team on-air as the &quot;No-Names.&quot;</p>
<p>The controversy over the nickname continues to this day, as many former students and faculty were angered that a unique name like Hurons was replaced by a common name like Eagles, especially for reasons of <a>political correctness</a>.
Some alumni have even refused to donate money to the school until the name Hurons is restored.
An official chapter of the EMU Alumni Association, the Huron Restoration Chapter, seeks to bring back the name and claims to have the support of Chief Leaford Bearskin of the <a>Wyandot</a> Tribe of Oklahoma and former Grand Chief Max Gros-Louis of the <a>Huron-Wendat Nation</a> of Quebec.</p>

<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p> [[Image:Eastern michigan University indoor practice field with polyester roof.JPG|thumb|150px|Indoor practice field with air-supported [[polyester]] <a>roof</a>]] Eastern Michigan athletic teams have been successful on a national level, winning three <a>NCAA</a> Division II national championships and 13 <a>NAIA</a> Division I national championships in five different sports (baseball, men's cross country, men's swimming and diving, men's indoor track and field, and men's outdoor track and field).</p>
<p>EMU Athletic facilities include <a>Rynearson Stadium</a>, <a>EMU Convo Center</a>, EMU indoor practice field and <a>Bowen Field House</a></p>
<p>EMU has also been <a>NCAA</a> Division I national runner-up twice: in 1940, the men's cross country team finished second to <a>Indiana University</a> at the national meet hosted by <a>Michigan State University</a>; then, on June 19, 1976, after finishing in sixth place the year before, the baseball team was defeated by the <a>University of Arizona</a> in the final game of the <a>College World Series</a> at <a>Johnny Rosenblatt Stadium</a> in <a>Omaha</a>, <a>Nebraska</a>.
Eastern Michigan remains the last northern school to make to the NCAA Division I baseball championship game.
<a>thumb|150px|Rynearson Stadium track, EMU Convocation &amp; Athletic Center in the background.</a>
<a>thumb|150px|left|Rynearson Stadium Press box.</a>
Eastern's men's basketball team has appeared in four NCAA Division I tournaments, and have a 3-4 record, tied for third best among Michigan colleges.
In the <a>1996 Men's Basketball Tournament</a>, Eastern Michigan defeated the <a>Duke</a> Blue Devils in the opening round; it would be the Blue Devils' last first- or second-round defeat until <a>2007</a>, when they were upended by <a>VCU</a> in the opening round.
</p>
<p>The Eagles have the most <a>MAC</a> championships in a single sport, 26, in men's swimming and diving (1978, 1980&#x2013;1996, 1998, 2000&#x2013;2005, and 2007).</p>
<p>The 2006&#x2013;2007 season was a successful one for Eastern Michigan, as they won an EMU and Mid-American Conference record eight conference titles: Men's Cross Country, Men's Swimming And Diving, Women's Swimming And Diving, Softball, Men's Indoor Track, Women's Gymnastics, Men's Golf and Men's Outdoor Track.
This beat the school's previous record of five titles as well as the previous MAC record of six.</p>
<p>Traditionally, Eastern's football teams have struggled, and the program has had problems attracting fans, partially due to their proximity to the powerful <a>University of Michigan</a> just seven miles (11&nbsp;km) away.
After reaching a low point with a 27-game losing streak that was finally snapped in 1982, EMU started to become competitive.
In 1987, EMU won its first Mid-American Conference title then defeated 17&#x00bd;-point favorite San Jose State in the <a>California Bowl</a>.
The 1988 and 1989 teams each finished in second place in the conference and ended the most successful stretch of football in school history with its fourth straight winning season.
<a>thumb|150px|right|Oestrike Stadium looking towards Huron River Drive.</a>
Since being renamed as &quot;Eagles&quot; (formerly &quot;Hurons&quot;, cynics have suggested the new nickname has put a &quot;hex&quot; on the team) the football teams have returned to mediocrity, with just one winning season (1995).
Despite the expansion of <a>Rynearson Stadium</a> to 30,000 seats, drawing fans continues to be a problem: <a>NCAA</a> rules state that in order to stay in Division I-A for football, each team must attract an average of 15,000 fans per game.
During a 1-11 season in 2006, Eastern's EMU Foundation purchased 5,000 tickets for local high school students to curb this threat to their status.
EMU has also played a few home games at <a>Ford Field</a> in downtown <a>Detroit</a> starting in 2004 (The &quot;Collegiate Clash&quot;) where they have hosted <a>Central Michigan University</a> (2004), <a>Western Michigan University</a> (2005), the <a>United States Naval Academy</a> (2006), and <a>Northwestern University</a> on October 19, 2007.
These appearances in Detroit have been beneficial to their average attendance, as it usually gets around 25,000 fans.
EMU often plays home games at night, so they won't interfere with U of M home games on the same day.
Also, in recent years they have scheduled some games on Thursday and Friday nights, which boosts student attendance (EMU is a majority commuter school, and even those who stay in the dorms often go home over weekends).
There have been small successes though, such as a 6-4 record against rivals Western Michigan and Central Michigan in the 5 years under coach Jeff Genyk from 2004 to 2008, setting a school record for a 5 year span against Western and Central.</p>
<p>EMU was a member of the <a>Interstate Intercollegiate Athletic Conference</a> from 1950 to 1961.</p>
<h3>Marching and basketball bands</h3>
<p> The Eastern Michigan University Marching Band, nicknamed &quot;The Pride of the Peninsula,&quot; was first formed in 1924.
Notable past leaders of the EMU band program include Mitch Osadchuk (1956&#x2013;1964), Thomas Tyra (1964&#x2013;1977), Max Plank (1979&#x2013;2002) &lt;!--
I don't think these years are right, wasn't Dr. Woike the Director of Bands between Plank and Boerma?
--&gt;and Scott Boerma (2002&#x2013;2007).
The University Bands are presently directed by Dr. Mary K. Schneider (the Wind Symphony) and Dr. Amy Knopps (the Symphonic Band and Marching Band).
The band plays both <em>Go Green</em> and the <em>Eagles Fight Song</em> for pregame at football games, and after every game and rehearsal the marching band sings <em>Our Pledge</em>.
Other major parts of the pregame performance include the tunnel entrance and &quot;Floating E&quot;.
</p>
<p>The EMU Marching Band also provides a wide variety of half time entertainment throughout the season.
In recent years, The EMUMB has traveled with the football team to The University of Michigan, Michigan State University, and Ford Field in Detroit.
The EMU Marching Band has also performed at venues such as The Pontiac Silverdome and Rich Stadium in Buffalo, NY.
In 2008, The EMUMB performed in America's Thanksgiving Day Parade in Detroit, MI. </p>
<p>The Eastern Michigan University Basketball Band is directed by the two graduate assistants of the band.
Unlike the marching band which is made up of all brass and woodwinds, the Basketball Band's instrumentation is strictly &quot;Brass and Sax.&quot;
The Basketball Band travels with the basketball teams during the MAC tournament or the NCAA tournament.</p>
<h4>Music</h4>
<p>The school song &quot;Our Pledge&quot; was written by Edward Bowles and was arranged for the <a>marching band</a> by <a>Thomas Tyra</a>.
The melody of &quot;Eagles Fight Song&quot; was written by Larry Livingston and arranged for marching band by Thomas Tyra.
The percussion parts were written by <a>Whitney Prince</a>.
&quot;Go Green&quot; was written by Thomas Tyra.</p>
