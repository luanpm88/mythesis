<p>The <strong>Universit&#x00e9; du Qu&#x00e9;bec &#x00e0; Montr&#x00e9;al</strong> (<strong>UQAM</strong>) is one of four <a>universities</a> in <a>Montreal</a>, <a>Quebec</a>, <a>Canada</a>.</p>
<h2>Basic facts</h2>
<p>The UQAM is the largest constituent element of the <a>Universit&#x00e9; du Qu&#x00e9;bec</a> (UQ), a public university system with other branches in <a>Gatineau</a> (near Ottawa), <a>Rimouski</a>, <a>Rouyn-Noranda</a>, <a>Quebec City</a>, <a>Chicoutimi</a>, and <a>Trois-Rivi&#x00e8;res</a>.
UQAM was founded on April 9, 1969 by the government of Quebec, through the merger of the &#x00c9;cole des Beaux-Arts de Montr&#x00e9;al, a fine arts school; the <a>Coll&#x00e8;ge Sainte-Marie</a>, a classical college; and a number of smaller schools.
Although part of the UQ network, UQAM possesses a relative independence which allows it to print its own diplomas and choose its rector.</p>
<p>In 2004, UQAM had a student population of 42,257 in six faculties (Arts, Education, Literature, Language and Communications, Political Science and Law, Science, and Social science) and one school (Management).
It offers Bachelors, Masters, and Doctoral degrees.
It is one of Montreal's two <a>French-language</a> universities, along with the <a>Universit&#x00e9; de Montr&#x00e9;al</a>, and only 1% of its student population is Anglophone.
With the addition of the <a>T&#x00e9;l&#x00e9;-universit&#x00e9;</a> in June 2005, UQAM, with a current student population of about 60,000, is the largest French-speaking university in the world.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left</a> UQAM's campus was designed by <a>Dimitri Dimakopoulos</a> and is located in downtown Montreal, with most of its buildings in the <a>Quartier Latin</a> neighbourhood near the <a>Berri-UQAM metro station</a> and the newer <a>Complexe des sciences Pierre-Dansereau</a> near <a>Place des Arts</a>.
The University is also involved in the troubled <a>&#x00ce;lot Voyageur</a> project, a 13-storey student residence and intercity bus terminal, but has had to scale back its involvement due to financial problems.</p>

<h2>Finances</h2>
<p>A commissioned report by <a>PricewaterhouseCoopers</a> has called for cost-cutting measures at UQAM to help the university out of a financial crisis, brought on by $100 million in construction cost overruns for its sciences centre and costs for &#x00ce;lot Voyageur, which soared from $226 million to more than $400 million when the Quebec government pulled out of the project, citing unauthorized design changes.
The Quebec government has said that unless UQ&#x00c0;M cuts costs, the university's total project-related debt could be $500 million by 2012</pre>
