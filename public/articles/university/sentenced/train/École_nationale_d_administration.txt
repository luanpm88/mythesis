<p>The <strong>&#x00c9;cole Nationale d'Administration</strong> (, <em>National Management School</em>), or <strong>&#x00c9;NA</strong>, one of the most prestigious of French graduate schools  (<a>Grandes &#x00e9;coles</a>), was created in 1945 by <a>Charles de Gaulle</a> to democratise access to the senior civil service.
It is now entrusted with the selection and initial training of senior French officials.
The ENA is one of the symbols of the Republican <a>meritocracy</a>, offering its alumni access to high positions within the state.
It has now been almost completely relocated in <a>Strasbourg</a> to emphasise its European character.</p>
<p>The ENA produces around 100 graduates every year, known as <em>&#x00e9;narques</em> ().
ENA is seen as the method of choice to reach the <a>great administrative corps of the State</a>.</p>
<h2>ENA and politics</h2>
<p>The main reason for entering ENA is that it has a legal quasi-monopoly over access to some of the most prestigious positions in the French civil service (the <a>&#x00c9;cole polytechnique</a> fulfills this role for other prestigious and technical positions, while some schools like the &#x00c9;cole Nationale des Imp&#x00f4;ts allow access to very specific positions).
The school was created in a move to make the recruitment for various high administrative bodies more rational and democratic.
By having a system solely based on academic proficiency and competitive examinations, the reasoning went, recruitment to top positions could be made more transparent, without suspicion of political or personal preference.
</p>
<p>French law makes it relatively easy for civil servants to enter politics: civil servants who are elected or appointed to a political position do not have to resign their position in the civil service; instead, they are put in a situation of &quot;temporary leave&quot; known as <em>disponibilit&#x00e9;</em>.
If they are not re-elected or reappointed, they may ask for their reintegration into their service (see <a>Lionel Jospin</a>, <a>Bruno M&#x00e9;gret</a> and <a>Philippe S&#x00e9;guin</a> for examples).
In addition, ENA graduates are often recruited as aides by government ministers and other politicians; this makes it easier for some of them to enter a political career.
As an example, <a>Dominique de Villepin</a> entered politics as an <em>appointed</em> official, after serving as an aide to <a>Jacques Chirac</a>, without ever having held an elected position.</p>
<p>The <em>&#x00e9;narques</em> were criticised as early as the 1960s for their <a>technocratic</a> and arrogant ways.
Young <em>&#x00e9;narque</em> <a>Jacques Chirac</a> was, for instance, lampooned in an album of the <a>Asterix</a> series.
Such criticism has continued up to present times, with the <em>&#x00e9;narques</em> being accused of monopolizing positions in higher administration and politics, without having to show real efficiency.
It has become a recurrent theme for many French politicians to criticise ENA, even when they themselves are alumni of the school.
</p>
<p><a>John Kenneth Galbraith</a> and <a>Pierre Bourdieu</a> have studied the way this school shapes French industry and politics.
The key point is that these &quot;enarques&quot; benefit from two main privileges: not only do they have a monopoly of the top administrative positions within the civil service, but also they can go into politics and industry without risk.</p>
<p>However, only a small proportion of &quot;enarques&quot; (around 10%) actually get involved in politics.
Most ENA alumni hold neutral, technical positions in the French civil service.</p>
<p>ENA also participates in international Technical Assistance programmes, funded by the EU or other donors.</p>
<h2>Recruitment and exit procedures</h2>
<p>Entrance to ENA is granted on a competitive exam at the beginning of September, which people generally take after completing studies at the <em><a>Institut d'&#x00e9;tudes politiques de Paris</a></em> (more widely known as <em>Sciences Po</em>).
The &quot;concours externe&quot; exam is in two parts :  : The written part includes :: - an essay on public law :: - an essay on the economy :: - an essay on &quot;general knowledge&quot; (<em>culture g&#x00e9;n&#x00e9;rale</em>, extremely common in French competitive exams), :: - a <em>note de synth&#x00e8;se</em> (summarizing 40 to 70 pages of documents) in either (at the candidate's choice) European Law and Policies (<em>Questions Europ&#x00e9;ennes</em>) or Social Law and Policies (<em>Questions Sociales</em>) :: - a <em>cinqui&#x00e8;me &#x00e9;preuve</em> chosen by the candidate among many different subjects ranging from mathematics to &quot;administrative sciences&quot; or language.</p>
<p>: The oral exam, taken only by those with the highest marks in the written exam, consists of :: - An oral examination on Public Finances :: - An oral examination on International Politics (<em>Questions Internationales</em>) :: - An oral examination either on <em>Questions Europ&#x00e9;ennes</em> or on <em>Questions Sociales</em> (whichever subject the candidate did not choose on the written test) :: - An oral examination to test the skill of the candidate in a foreign language.
:: - A physical test :: - the famous 45-minute long <em>Grand Oral</em> during which any question can be asked, from general knowledge to very personal questions.</p>
<p>Results of this exam process are published by the end of December.
</p>
<p>Other exam processes govern admission for career civil servants training themselves for high-level positions (<em>concours interne</em>) and for political or union leaders who need specific training (<em>troisi&#x00e8;me concours</em>).</p>
<p>ENA ranks students according to their academic merit; students are then asked, in order of decreasing merit, the service that they want to join.
While the top-ranked join prestigious corps such as the <em><a>Inspection G&#x00e9;n&#x00e9;rale des Finances</a></em>, <em><a>Conseil d'&#x00c9;tat</a></em> or <a>Cour des Comptes</a>, and some enter national politics, many end up in high-level administrative positions.
To quote [<a>http://www.ena.fr/accueil.php</a>|ENA's
site]: :<em>In fact, although these famous alumni are the most visible, the majority are largely unknown, lead quiet and useful careers in <a>our civil service</a>, and don't recognise themselves in the stereotyped images about our school.</em></p>
<h2>Promotions</h2>
<p>Academic years at ENA are known as <em>promotions</em>, and are named after outstanding Europeans.
