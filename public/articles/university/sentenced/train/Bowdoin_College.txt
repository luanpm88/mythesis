<p><strong>Bowdoin College</strong> , founded in 1794, is a private <a>liberal arts college</a> located in the coastal <a>New England</a> town of <a>Brunswick</a>, <a>Maine</a>.
As of 2010, <em><a>U.S. News and World Report</a></em> ranks Bowdoin sixth among liberal arts colleges in the United States.
The college enrolls approximately 1,700 students and has been coeducational since 1971.
It offers 33 majors and 4 additional minors; the academic year consists of two four-course semesters, and the student-faculty ratio is 9:1.</p>
<p>Brunswick is located on the shores of <a>Casco Bay</a> and the <a>Androscoggin River</a>, 12 miles north of <a>Freeport</a>, Maine, and 28 miles north of <a>Portland</a>, Maine.
In addition to its Brunswick campus, Bowdoin also operates a 118 acre (478,000 m&#x00b2;) coastal studies center on <a>Orrs Island</a> in <a>Harpswell</a>, Maine and a 200 acre  (809,000 m&#x00b2;) scientific field station on Kent Island, in the <a>Bay of Fundy</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Founding and 19th Century</h3>

<p>Bowdoin College was chartered in 1794 by Governor <a>Samuel Adams</a> of Massachusetts, of which Maine was then a district, and was named for former Massachusetts governor <a>James Bowdoin</a>, whose son <a>James Bowdoin III</a> was an early benefactor.
At the time of its founding, it was the easternmost college in the United States.
It is thought that the Bowdoin seal, created in 1798 by Joseph Callender, was a sun because it was the first college in the United States to see the sunrise.
In 1806, 13 Harvard graduates opted to accept a Bowdoin degree along with their diploma from Harvard.</p>
<p>Bowdoin came into its own in the 1820s, a decade in which Maine became an independent state as a result of the <a>Missouri Compromise</a> and the college graduated a number of its most famous alumni, including future United States <a>President</a> <a>Franklin Pierce</a>, class of 1824, and writers <a>Nathaniel Hawthorne</a> and <a>Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</a>, both of whom graduated <a>Phi Beta Kappa</a> in 1825.</p>
<p>Bowdoin's connections to the <a>Civil War</a> have prompted some to quip that the war &quot;began and ended&quot; in Brunswick.
<a>Harriet Beecher Stowe</a>, &quot;the little lady who started this big war,&quot; started writing her influential anti-slavery novel <em><a>Uncle Tom's Cabin</a></em> in Bowdoin's Appleton Hall while her husband was teaching at the College, and <a>Brigadier General</a> (and <a>Brevet</a> <a>Major General</a>) <a>Joshua Chamberlain</a>, a Bowdoin alumnus and professor, was responsible for receiving the surrender of the <a>Army of Northern Virginia</a> at <a>Appomattox Court House</a> in 1865.
Chamberlain, a <a>Medal of Honor</a> recipient who later served as <a>governor of Maine</a>, adjutant-general of Maine, and president of Bowdoin, distinguished himself at <a>Gettysburg</a>, where he led the <a>20th Maine</a> in its valiant defense of <a>Little Round Top</a>.</p>
<p>There are other Civil War connections as well: Major General <a>Oliver Otis Howard</a>, class of 1850, led the <a>Freedmen's Bureau</a> after the war and later founded <a>Howard University</a>; Massachusetts Governor <a>John A. Andrew</a>, class of 1837, was responsible for the formation of the famous <a>54th Massachusetts</a>; and <a>William P. Fessenden</a> 1823 and <a>Hugh McCulloch</a> 1827 both served as Secretary of the Treasury during the <a>Lincoln Administration</a>.
After the war, Bowdoin contended that a higher percentage of its alumni fought in the war than that of any other college in the North&#x2014;and not only for the Union.
In fact, <a>Confederate</a> President <a>Jefferson Davis</a> held an <a>honorary degree</a> from Bowdoin, which he received while <a>United States Secretary of War</a> in 1858.
President <a>Ulysses S. Grant</a>, too, was given an honorary degree from the college in 1865.

<h3>Twentieth century</h3>
<p>Although Bowdoin's Medical School of Maine closed its doors in 1920, the College is currently known for its particularly strong programs in the natural sciences.
One illustrious alumnus was Dr. <a>Augustus Stinchfield</a>, who received his MD in 1868, who went on to become one of the co-founders of the <a>Mayo Clinic</a> in Rochester, Minnesota.
He was asked to join the two Mayo brother's private medical practice in 1892.
In 1915, the remaining partners in the then private practice embraced the creation of the non-profit Mayo Clinic.
While perhaps Bowdoin's better-known alumnus in the sciences is the controversial entomologist-turned-sexologist <a>Alfred Kinsey</a>, class of 1916, the College's reputation in this area was cemented in large part by the Arctic explorations of Admiral <a>Robert E. Peary</a>, class of 1877, and <a>Donald B. MacMillan</a>, class of 1898.
Peary led the first successful expedition to the <a>North Pole</a> in 1908, and MacMillan, a member of Peary's crew, became famous in his own right as he explored <a>Greenland</a>, <a>Baffin Island</a> and <a>Labrador</a> in the schooner <em>Bowdoin</em> between 1908 and 1954.
Bowdoin's Peary-MacMillan Arctic Museum  honors the two explorers, and the College's mascot, the <a>Polar Bear</a>, was chosen in 1913 to honor MacMillan, who donated a particularly large specimen to his alma mater in 1917.</p>
<p>[[Image:President's House at Bowdoin College.jpg|thumb|left|[[Italianate]]
residence of the college's president in circa 1920]]</p>
<p>Following in the footsteps of President <a>Pierce</a> and House Speaker <a>Thomas Brackett Reed</a>, class of 1860, several 20th century Bowdoin graduates have assumed prominent positions in national government while representing the Pine Tree State.
<a>Wallace H. White, Jr.</a>, class of 1899, served as Senate Minority Leader from 1944&#x2013;1947 and Senate Majority Leader from 1947&#x2013;1949; Joseph Finnegan, class of 1923, later served as Senator for MA, <a>George J. Mitchell</a>, class of 1954, served as Senate Majority Leader from 1989-1995 before assuming a prominent role in the Northern Ireland peace process; and <a>William Cohen</a>, class of 1962, spent twenty-five years in the House and Senate before being appointed Secretary of Defense in the <a>Clinton</a> Administration.
Maine's First Congressional District has been christened the &quot;Bowdoin seat&quot; because of its long occupation by graduates of the College.
A total of eleven Bowdoin graduates have ascended to the Maine governorship, and three graduates of the College currently sit on the state's highest court.</p>
<p>Over the last several decades, Bowdoin College has modernized dramatically.
In 1970, it became one of a very limited number of selective schools to make the <a>SAT</a> optional in the admissions process, and in 1971, after nearly 180 years as a small men's college, Bowdoin admitted its first class of women.
Bowdoin also abolished <a>fraternities</a> in the late 1990s, replacing them with a system of college-owned social houses.</p>
<p>Course distribution requirements were abolished in the 1970s but were reinstated by a faculty majority vote in 1981, as a result of an initiative by oral communication and film professor Barbara Kaster.
She insisted that distribution requirements would ensure students a more well-rounded education in a diversity of fields and therefore present them with more career possibilities.
The requirements of at least two courses in each of the categories of <a>Natural Sciences</a>/<a>Mathematics</a>, Social and <a>Behavioral Sciences</a>, <a>Humanities</a>/<a>Fine Arts</a> and Foreign Studies (including languages) took effect for the Class of 1987 and have been gradually amended since then.
Current requirements require one course each in: Natural Sciences, Quantitive Reasoning, Visual and Performing Arts, International Perspectives and Exploring Social Differences.
A small, writing intensive course, called a First Year Seminar, is also required.</p>
<h3>Recent developments</h3>
<p>[[Image:Museumandpavilionsfw.jpg|thumb|right|20.8 million dollar renovations of the [[Bowdoin College Museum of Art]] (originally built in 1911), completed in 2007.]]
Recent developments include the 2001 appointment of <a>Barry Mills</a>, class of 1972, as the fifth alumnus president of the College, and a 2002 decision by the faculty to change the grading system so that it incorporated plus and minus grades.</p>
<p>On January 18, 2008, Bowdoin announced that it would be eliminating loans for all new and current students receiving financial aid, replacing those loans with grants beginning with the 2008-2009 academic year.
It will be joining a very small group of schools who have chosen the &quot;no-loans&quot; policy, among them <a>Harvard University</a>, <a>Yale University</a> and <a>Princeton University</a>, all of whom have very large endowments.
President Mills stated, &quot;Some see a calling in such vital but often low paying fields such as teaching or social work.
With significant debt at graduation, some students will undoubtedly be forced to make career or education choices not on the basis of their talents, interests, and promise in a particular field, but rather on their capacity to repay student loans.
As an institution devoted to the common good, Bowdoin must consider the fairness of such a result.&quot;
In 2006, <em><a>Newsweek</a></em> described Bowdoin as a &quot;<a>New Ivy</a>&quot;, one of a number of elite colleges and universities outside of the <a>Ivy League</a>.
Bowdoin is also part of the <a>SAT optional movement</a> for undergraduate admission.
Bowdoin was the first college to be named &quot;School of the Year&quot; by <a>College Prowler</a>.
In the <a>Forbes Magazine</a> ranking of American colleges, which combines liberal arts colleges, national research universities, and military academies together in one list, the College is ranked #40.
Among liberal arts colleges only, Bowdoin ranks #22 in the survey.</p>
<p>The Government &amp; Legal Studies Department, whose prominent professors include <a>Allen Springer</a>, <a>Paul Franco</a>, <a>Richard E. Morgan</a>, <a>Chris Potholm</a> and <a>Jean M. Yarbrough</a>, was ranked the top small college political science program in the world by researchers at the <a>London School of Economics</a> in 2003.
Government &amp; Legal Studies was the most popular major for every graduating class between 2000 and 2009.</p>
<h2>Student body</h2>
<p>In 2009, Bowdoin's overall acceptance rate was 18.5% &#x2014; lower than both Williams and Middlebury Colleges &#x2014; making it the second most selective <a>NESCAC</a> school, and one of the most selective colleges in the country.
Of enrolling students, 89% are in the top 10% of their high school graduating class.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: <a>right|thumb|Coles Tower, constructed in 1964 as the &quot;Senior Center&quot;, is the second tallest building in Maine.</a>
--&gt;</p>
<p>The April 17, 2008, edition of <em>The Economist</em> noted Bowdoin in an article on university admissions: &quot;So-called 'almost-Ivies' such as Bowdoin and Middlebury also saw record low admission rates this year (18% each).
It is now as hard to get into Bowdoin, says the college's admissions director, as it was to get into Princeton in the 1970s.&quot;
Although Bowdoin does not require the <a>SAT</a> in admissions, all students must submit a score upon matriculation.
The middle 50% SAT range for the verbal and math sections of the <a>SAT</a> is 660-750 and 660-750, respectively &#x2014; numbers only of those submitting scores during the admissions process.
The middle 50% ACT range is 30&#x2013;33.</p>
<p>While a significant portion of the student body hails from <a>New England</a> &#x2014; including nearly 25% from Massachusetts and 10% from Maine &#x2014; recent classes have drawn from an increasingly national pool.
Although Bowdoin once had a reputation for homogeneity (both ethnically and socioeconomically), a diversity campaign has increased the percentage of students of color in recent classes to more than 31%.
In fact, admission of minorities goes back at least as far as <a>John Brown Russwurm</a> 1826, Bowdoin's first African-American college graduate, and the third African-American graduate of any American college.</p>
<p>Many students apply for financial aid, and around 85% of those who apply receive aid.
Bowdoin is a <a>need-blind</a> and a no-loans institution.
Students applying to the school are evaluated independently of their financial situations, the college meets 100% of demonstrated financial need, and the college replaces loans with grants for all students on financial aid to lift the burden of significant student debt upon graduation.</p>
<p>The class of 2014 is the largest ever, consisting of 510 students, with an acceptance rate of 19.7%.
The ratio of males to females changed to being 51% male and 49% female.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|175px|Junior Prize Declamation, Bowdoin College, 19th century</a> Recalling his days at Bowdoin in a recent interview, Professor <a>Richard E. Morgan</a> '59 described student life at the then-all-male school as &quot;monastic,&quot; and noted that &quot;the only things to do were either work or drink.&quot;
(This is corroborated by the <em><a>Official Preppy Handbook</a>,</em> which in 1980 ranked Bowdoin the number two drinking school in the country, behind <a>Dartmouth</a>.)
These days, Morgan observed, the College offers a far broader array of recreational opportunities: &quot;If we could have looked forward in time to Bowdoin's standard of living today, we would have been astounded.&quot;
</p>
<p>Bowdoin is particularly well-known for its dining services, which the <em><a>Princeton Review</a></em> has ranked first in three of the last four years, including the 2006-2007 school year.
The College has two major dining halls, one of which was renovated in the late 1990s, and every academic year begins with a lobster bake outside Farley Fieldhouse.
Bowdoin also does well in other lifestyle categories; in 2004 it ranked 10th in dorm quality and 14th for quality of life.
In April 2008, <a>College Prowler</a>, a publishing company for guidebooks on top colleges and universities in the United States and written by students, named Bowdoin College its &quot;School of the Year&quot; citing excellence in academics, safety and security, housing and dining.</p>
<p>Since abolishing Greek <a>fraternities</a> in the late 1990s, Bowdoin has switched to a system in which entering students are assigned a &quot;college house&quot; affiliation correlating with their first-year dormitory.
While six houses were originally established, following the construction of two new dorms, two were added effective in the fall of 2007, bringing the total to eight: Ladd (affiliated with Osher Hall), Baxter (West), Quinby (Appleton), MacMillan (Coleman), Howell (Hyde), Helmreich (Maine), Reed (Moore), and Burnett (Winthrop).
The college houses are physical buildings around campus which host parties and other events throughout the year.
Those students who choose not to live in their affiliated house retain their affiliation and are considered members throughout their Bowdoin career.
Before the fraternity system was abolished in the 1990s, all the Bowdoin fraternities were co-educational (except for one unrecognized sorority and two unrecognized all-male fraternities).</p>
<p>Bowdoin's chapter of <a>Phi Beta Kappa</a>, which was founded in 1825, is the nation's sixth oldest.
Among those who have been inducted to the Maine Alpha chapter as undergraduates include <a>Nathaniel Hawthorne</a> (1825), <a>Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</a> (1825), <a>Robert E. Peary</a> (1877), <a>Owen Brewster</a> (1909), <a>Harold Hitz Burton</a> (1909), <a>Paul Douglas</a> (1913), <a>Alfred Kinsey</a> (1916), <a>Thomas R. Pickering</a> (1953), and <a>Lawrence B. Lindsey</a> (1976).

<h2>Meddiebempsters</h2>
<p><strong>The Meddiebempsters</strong> are the oldest of Bowdoin's six <a>a cappella</a> groups and the third-oldest a cappella group in the nation.</p>
<p>Founded in the spring of 1937, the Meddies gained notoriety when they performed in <a>USO</a> shows after <a>World War II</a>.
In 1948, the Meddiebempsters performed for the <a>First Family</a> and were then invited to take a USO tour of <a>Europe</a> for the first time.
The tour's enormous success resulted in a full performance calendar for the 1948-1949 academic year.
The <a>Department of Defense</a> invited them back every summer from 1948 to 1955 and the group appeared on the <a>Tex and Jinx Show</a>.</p>
<p>The Meddiebempsters, who are known for wearing navy coats and ties, have produced dozens of albums and continue to perform today.</p>
<h2>Postgraduate placement</h2>
<p>In 2003, the <em><a>Wall Street Journal</a></em> ranked Bowdoin among the top twenty colleges and universities in the United States based on the percentage of the school's alumni who attend a &quot;top-five&quot; graduate program in business, law, or medicine (ahead of a number of highly-ranked universities, including <a>Rice</a>, <a>Northwestern</a>, <a>Johns Hopkins</a>, <a>Cornell</a>, <a>Caltech</a>, <a>Michigan</a>, <a>Virginia</a>, <a>Notre Dame</a>, <a>Emory</a>, <a>UC Berkeley</a>, <a>Tufts</a> and <a>Washington University</a>).</p>
<p>In 2006, Bowdoin was named a &quot;Top Producer of <a>Fulbright Award</a>s for American Students&quot; by the Institute of International Education.</p>
<p>According to payscale.com,
alumni of Bowdoin College have a mid-career median salary of $106,000, making it the 29th highest among colleges and universities in the United States.
The median starting salary of $52,700 ranked 55th in the same peer group.</p>
<h2>Student organizations</h2>
<h3>Media and Publications</h3>
<p>Bowdoin's student newspaper, <em><a>The Bowdoin Orient</a></em>, is the oldest continuously published college weekly in the United States.
The Orient was named the second best tabloid-sized college weekly at a Collegiate Associated Press conference in March 2007.
Additionally, the school's literary magazine, <em><a>The Quill</a></em>, has been published since 1897.
The College's radio station, <a>WBOR</a>, has been in operation since 1951.
In 1999, <em>The Bowdoin Cable Network</em> was formed, producing a weekly newscast and several student created shows per semester.</p>
<h3>A Cappella</h3>
<p>Of the six a cappella groups on campus, the <a>Meddiebempsters</a> and Longfellows are all-male, Miscellania and Bella Mafia are all-female, and BOKA and Ursus Verses are co-ed.
The <a>Meddiebempsters</a>, the oldest of Bowdoin's six <a>a cappella</a> groups and the third oldest collegiate a cappella group in the nation, were well known after World War II for performing at numerous USO shows in Europe.</p>
<h3>Other</h3>
<p>The largest student group on campus is the Outing Club, which leads canoeing, kayaking, rafting, camping and backpacking trips throughout Maine.
One of the school's two historic rival literary societies, the <a>Peucinian Society</a>, has recently been revitalized from its previous form.
This organization has appropriated such people as <a>Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</a> and <a>Joshua Chamberlain</a> amongst its former members, though these individuals originally belonged to the Athenian Society (the second society of the two historic groups).
The Peucinian Society was founded in 1805, making it one of the oldest literary and intellectual societies in the country.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>Museums on Bowdoin's campus include the <a>Bowdoin College Museum of Art</a>, the <a>Joshua L. Chamberlain Museum</a>, and the <a>Peary-MacMillan Arctic Museum</a>.
Notable Buildings include <a>Massachusetts Hall</a>, <a>Hubbard Hall</a>, the <a>Parker Cleaveland House</a> and the <a>Harriet Beecher Stowe House</a>.

In 2004, Bowdoin became the second college in the United States to elevate the women's rugby team to varsity status.
While technically still varsity, the women's rugby team competes in New England Rugby Football Union, rather than NESCAC.
The sailing team, which competes in the New England Intercollegiate Sailing Association (NEISA) is co-ed and was considered in 2006 to be one of the top 20 sailing teams in the nation by Sailing World magazine.
There are also intercollegiate and club teams in men's and women's fencing, men's and women's rowing, men's rugby, water polo, men's volleyball and men's and women's <a>Ultimate</a>.
Recent NESCAC champions include men's tennis (2008), men's cross country (2001, 2002), women's basketball (2001&#x2013;2007), women's ice hockey (2002, 2004) and women's field hockey (2001, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2010); recent NCAA tournament appearances include women's basketball (Elite Eight, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2006, 2007; Final Four, 2004), men's rugby (sweet 16, 2001), women's ice hockey (Final Four, 2002, 2003; Elite Eight, 2004, 2005) and men's soccer (Final Four, 2010).
</p>
<p>Women's field hockey has been Bowdoin's most successful sport.
The field hockey team have been NESCAC champions in 2001, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2010.
They have been in the Final Four of the NCAA tournament in 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2010; Bowdoin were National Champions in 2007 (defeating <a>Middlebury College</a>), 2008 (defeating <a>Tufts University</a>) and 2010 (defeating <a>Messiah College</a>.)
Head coach Nicky Pearson has been NESCAC coach of the year a record 7 times, no other coach in any NESCAC sport has won the award more than twice.
In 2007 and 2008, Pearson was also honored as the NCAA Division III coach of the year.</p>
<h3>Facilities</h3>
<p>Bowdoin's athletic facilities combine modern &amp; high-tech buildings with old traditions, and have been historically used as training grounds for Olympic athletes.
In addition to several outdoor athletic fields, the College's athletic facilities include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sidney J. Watson Arena, one of the finest ice hockey arenas of Division III hockey, with a 2,300 spectator capacity and LEED certification.</li>

<h2>Sustainability</h2>
<p>According to its Environmental Mission Statement, Bowdoin College &quot;shall seek to encourage conservation, recycling, and other sustainable practices in its daily decision making processes, and shall take into account, in the operations of the College, all appropriate economic, environmental, and social concerns.&quot;
Between 2002 and 2008, Bowdoin College decreased its CO2 emissions by 40%.
It achieved that reduction by switching from #6 to #2 oil in its heating plant, reducing the campus set heating point from 72 to 68 degrees, and by adhering to its own Green Design Standards in renovations.
In addition, Bowdoin runs a <a>single stream recycling</a> program, and its dining services department has begun composting food waste and unbleached paper napkins.
Bowdoin received an overall grade of &quot;B&quot; for its sustainability efforts on the College Sustainability Report Card 2009 published by the Sustainable Endowments Institute.</p>
<h2>Alma mater</h2>
<p>Bowdoin's Alma Mater is &quot;Raise Songs to Bowdoin.&quot;
Originally penned by <a>Kenneth C.M. Sills</a>, class of 1901, new lyrics have since been added by Anthony Antolini '63, who serves on the faculty of the College's Department of Music.
Singers punch the air on the word 'friend' in both verses.
<a>thumb|right|Class of 1875 Gateway</a></p>
<p>:Raise songs to Bowdoin, praise her fame, :And sound abroad her glorious name; :To Bowdoin, Bowdoin lift your song, :And may the music echo long :O'er whispering pines and campus fair :With sturdy might filling the air.
:Bowdoin, from birth, our nurturer and friend :To thee we pledge our love again, again.
: &nbsp; :While now amid thy halls we stay :And breathe thy spirit day by day, :Oh may we thus full worthy be :To march in that proud company :Of poets, leaders and each one :Who brings thee fame by deeds well done.
:Bowdoin, from birth, our nurturer and friend :To thee we pledge our love again, again.</p>
<p>The original lyrics for the first verse were as follows.
The changed phrases have been highlighted.</p>
<p>:<strong>Rise sons of Bowdoin</strong>, praise her fame, :And <strong>sing aloud</strong> her glorious name; :To Bowdoin, Bowdoin lift your song, :And may the music echo long :O'er whispering pines and campus fair :With sturdy might filling the air.
:Bowdoin, from birth, <strong>the nurturer of men,</strong> :To thee we pledge our love again, again.</p>

One famous passage recalls the College: &quot;O ye familiar scenes,&#x2014;ye groves of pine / That once were mine and are no longer mine, &#x2014; / Thou river, widening through the meadows green / To the vast sea, so near and yet unseen, &#x2014; / Ye halls, in whose seclusion and repose / Phantoms of fame, like exhalations, rose / And vanished,&#x2014;we who are about to die / Salute you; earth and air and sea and sky / And the Imperial Sun that scatters down / His sovereign splendors upon grove and town.&quot;
