<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Early years</h3>
<p><a>thumb|150px|right|Roanoke College Historical Marker</a></p>
<p>Roanoke College was founded in 1842 as a boys' <a>preparatory school</a> by <a>Lutheran</a> pastors David F. Bittle and Christopher C. Baughmann.
Originally located in <a>Augusta County</a> near <a>Staunton</a>, the school was named Virginia Institute until chartered on January 30, 1845 as Virginia Collegiate Institute.
In 1847, the institute moved to <a>Salem</a> which was developing into a center of commerce and transportation in the region; the school moved all of its possessions in a single <a>covered wagon</a>.
The <a>Virginia General Assembly</a> granted a college charter on March 14, 1853 and approved the name Roanoke College, chosen in honor of the <a>Roanoke Valley</a>.
The student body was organized into a corps of cadets and fought with <a>Confederate</a> forces near Salem in December 1863.
The students were outmatched and quickly forced to surrender, but the <a>Union</a> commander allowed them to return to their studies in exchange for a promise to put down their arms.</p>
<h3>International students</h3>
<p>Roanoke enrolled its first international students in the late 19th century; the first <a>Mexican</a> student in 1876 and the first <a>Japan</a>ese student in 1888.
The first <a>Korea</a>n to graduate from an American college or university, Surh Beung Kiu, graduated in 1898.</p>
<h3>Coeducation</h3>
<p>Roanoke became <a>coeducational</a> in 1930 when women were admitted to counter a decline in male enrollment caused by the <a>Great Depression</a>.
A small number of women were previously offered limited admission, but not as degree seeking students.
Most were from <a>Elizabeth College</a>, a sister Lutheran <a>women's college</a> in Salem that burned in 1921; the students finished the 1921&#x2013;1922 academic year at Roanoke.
The first women's residence hall, Smith Hall, opened in 1941.
Roanoke's student body is now more than fifty percent female.</p>
<p>Roanoke adopted the alumnae of <a>Marion College</a>, a sister Lutheran <a>women's college</a> in <a>Marion, Virginia</a>, when it closed in 1967.
Marion Hall, a large residence hall constructed in 1968, honors the college and its alumnae.</p>
<h3>National championships</h3>
<p>Roanoke athletic teams have won two national championships: the 1972 <a>NCAA</a> <a>Division II</a> men's <a>basketball</a> championship and the 1978 <a>Division II</a> men's <a>lacrosse</a> championship.
Roanoke's third national championship occurred in 2001 when student Casey Smith won an individual championship in the <a>Division III</a> women's 10,000m <a>track and field</a> event.
In 2009, student Robin Yerkes secured Roanoke's fourth national championship when she won an individual championship in the <a>Division III</a> women's 400m <a>track and field</a> event.</p>
<h3>Recent years</h3>
<p>Roanoke experienced exceptional growth in the 1980s and 1990s.
Two strategic plans, the 1992 Sesquicentennial Campaign and the 2002 Plan, also known as &quot;The Difference&quot;, were successfully completed with well over $150 million raised.
The campaigns financed the renovation and construction of numerous facilities including the library, the student center, and the arts and performance center.</p>
<p>Roanoke's tenth president, and first female president, Dr. Sabine O'Hara, took office in August 2004.
O'Hara, an expert in sustainable economic development, was recruited to lead formulation of a new strategic plan, one that would advance the college into the next decade.
In March 2006, Roanoke unveiled &quot;The 2015 Plan&quot;, which calls for expanded academic offerings, an increase in enrollment from 1,900 to 2,100 students, renovation and construction of facilities to support increased enrollment, and growth in endowment resources to support financial aid for more students.
Successful completion of the plan is ongoing; 2,006 students were enrolled for fall semester 2007, the most in college history, and four new residence halls have opened since 2005.</p>
<h3>New leadership</h3>
<p>On March 16, 2007, Dr. Sabine O'Hara, Roanoke's tenth president, announced her resignation effective June 30, 2007.
O'Hara told the college community that she had accomplished her primary objective at Roanoke by unveiling &quot;The 2015 Plan&quot;, the college's current strategic plan, and that new leadership could better achieve the articulated goals.
O'Hara's three-year tenure as president was short, but productive; four new residence halls were constructed, two academic buildings were renovated, a new sports stadium opened, records were set for applications and enrollment, and the tradition of balanced budgets was continued (as of O'Hara's departure, Roanoke had a balanced budget for 52 consecutive years).</p>
<p>Michael C. Maxey became Roanoke's eleventh president on July 1, 2007.
Maxey previously served as Roanoke's vice president for college relations and dean of admissions and financial aid from 1992 until his selection as president.
Roanoke received a record number of applications nine times during Maxey's tenure as vice president, and in May 2007, graduated 410 students, the largest class at that time in college history.
In lieu of naming an interim president while a national search was conducted to replace O'Hara, the board of trustees unanimously elected Maxey to become Roanoke's eleventh president.</p>
<p>President Maxey presided over <a>commencement</a> for the first time on May 3, 2008.
Roanoke graduated 421 students, the largest class in college history.
On May 2, 2009, Roanoke graduated another record class of 439 students, the largest in college history.</p>

<h2>Lutheran heritage</h2>
<p><a>thumb|150px|right|Bittle Hall</a></p>
<p>Established in 1842, Roanoke is the second oldest (<a>Gettysburg College</a> is the oldest) Lutheran-affiliated college in the United States and is associated with three <a>synod</a>s of the <a>Evangelical Lutheran Church in America</a>; the Virginia Synod, the Metropolitan Washington, D.C. Synod, and the West Virginia&#x2013;Western Maryland Synod.
The Virginia Synod is headquartered on the Roanoke campus (in Bittle Hall; the college's first library now occupied by the Bishop of the Virginia Synod).</p>
<p>Historically, the state of Virginia has had a small Lutheran population.
As a result, Roanoke has admitted many students from other religious denominations.
Approximately 20 religious groups are now represented in the student body with <a>Roman Catholic</a> the most prevalent; Lutherans total less than 20% of the student body.</p>
<p>Roanoke has an active religious life program for students seeking that experience, however, religion is not prominent on the Roanoke campus; students are not required to attend religious services or to take classes in religion.
Roanoke has an independent board of trustees and is not controlled by the church.</p>
<p>The dominant aspect of Roanoke's Lutheran heritage is the college's commitment to <a>academic freedom</a>.
<a>Martin Luther</a> encouraged freedom from oppression along with freedom for learning and freedom for service in the community.
Roanoke aims to produce resourceful and responsible citizens who are well-educated in the Lutheran tradition of intellectual freedom.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>Roanoke is accredited by the <a>Southern Association of Colleges and Schools</a> to award bachelor's degrees in arts, science, and business administration.
In addition, the business administration program is accredited by the <a>Association of Collegiate Business Schools and Programs</a>; the chemistry program is accredited by the <a>American Chemical Society</a>; the teacher licensure program is accredited by the Teacher Education Accreditation Council; and the athletic training program is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs.
The college also offers dual degree programs with <a>Virginia Tech</a> and the <a>University of Tennessee</a> that lead to a Roanoke degree and an engineering degree from the other school.
These students complete the Honors Curriculum in lieu of the Roanoke College Core Curriculum.
Honors students are offered numerous special learning experiences including plays, lectures, concerts, and service projects.</p>
<p>Roanoke has 14 academic departments:</p>

</ul>
<h3>Greek History</h3>
<p>Roanoke has a long history of Greek organizations.
The Black Badge Society, organized at Roanoke in 1859, was one of the earliest Greek organizations established in the <a>South</a>.
The fraternity became inactive at Roanoke in 1879, but had expanded to include chapters at eight other colleges and universities, the last of which became inactive in 1882.</li>
<li><a>Phi Delta Theta</a> (Virginia Alpha Chapter, established 1869)</li>

</ul>
<p>Roanoke added sororities for the first time in 1955; the three organizations, Delta Gamma, Chi Omega, and Phi Mu, were housed in Bowman Hall for many years until they moved to Chesapeake Hall in 2006.
Roanoke's newest Greek organization is Delta Sigma Theta, the college's first historically <a>African-American</a> sorority.</p>
<h3>Housing</h3>
<p>Roanoke's Greek organizations reside in college-owned housing.
Roanoke's fraternity row, however, constructed in the 1960s, no longer houses the college's fraternities; the buildings have been converted into residence halls.
The Greek organizations are now housed in various locations on the Roanoke campus.
Kappa Alpha Order, Pi Kappa Alpha, Sigma Chi, and Alpha Sigma Alpha have houses.
Delta Gamma, Chi Omega, Phi Mu, and Pi Kappa Phi occupy Chesapeake Hall, a new residence hall that opened in 2006; each organization has a floor in the four-story building.</p>
<h3>Student Participation</h3>
<p>Roanoke's Greek organizations have a prominent role on campus, but are not dominant; approximately 25% of the Roanoke student body participates in Greek life.
Freshmen students must wait until spring semester to join a fraternity or sorority.
Roanoke has over 100 student organizations that provide many extracurricular opportunities other than Greek life.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<h3>Quadrangles</h3>
<p><a>thumb|230px|right|The Administration Building</a></p>
<p>Roanoke's campus is relatively self-contained with most academic buildings and residence halls built around two <a>quadrangles</a>; the John R. Turbyfill Front Quad  and the &quot;Back Quad&quot;.
Newer residence halls and athletic facilities form a partial outer ring around the traditional quads.
The campus is lined with brick sidewalks and has been recognized for its landscaping and views of the surrounding mountains.</p>
<h3>Architecture</h3>
<p>The campus architecture is a blend of traditional and modern styles.
The Administration Building, constructed in 1848 with bricks made on-site, and five other buildings, Miller Hall, Trout Hall, Bittle Hall, Francis T. West Hall, and Monterey House, are listed on the <a>National Register of Historic Places</a>.
The Fintel Library, the Colket Student Center, and most residence halls have the traditional style of the older structures.
Other newer buildings are more modern.

<p><a>thumb|230px|right|Fintel Library</a></p>
<h3>President's House</h3>
<p>The President's House is in a residential district approximately one-half mile north of the Roanoke campus.
The colonial revival mansion, one of the largest private homes in the area, was constructed in the late 1930s; was purchased in the mid-1950s by John P. Fishwick, president of the <a>Norfolk and Western Railway</a> and a Roanoke alumnus; and was acquired by the college in 1968.
Presidents Kendig, Fintel, Gring, O'Hara, and Maxey have lived in the house.</p>
<h3>Elizabeth Campus</h3>
<p>Additional college facilities, mostly residence halls and athletic fields, are located on the site of the former <a>Elizabeth College</a>, a Lutheran women's college that closed in 1922.
The area, approximately two miles east of the main campus, is now referred to as Roanoke's &quot;Elizabeth campus&quot;.
Houses for <a>Kappa Alpha Order</a>, <a>Pi Kappa Alpha</a>, and <a>Alpha Sigma Alpha</a> are on Elizabeth campus along with Elizabeth Hall, a large residence hall with apartments for non-freshman students.</p>

<h3>College Avenue</h3>
<p>Roanoke acquired three office buildings on College Avenue across from Francis T. West Hall in 2005 and 2006.
The buildings have been renovated to provide classroom and office space for various college departments.
With the acquisitions, the Roanoke campus occupies both sides of College Avenue from Main Street north to the traditional campus entrance.</p>
<h3>New construction</h3>
<p>With the opening of three new residence halls in 2005, Caldwell Hall, Allegheny Hall, and Ritter Hall, known collectively as &quot;CAR&quot;, the Roanoke campus has more than 50 buildings.
Afton Hall, an apartment-style residence hall, was renovated in 2009 as well and is the home to approximately 50 upperclassmen.</p>
<p>Lucas Hall, an academic building constructed in 1941, reopened in 2010 after complete renovation and is Roanoke's first <a>LEED</a> certified building.
</p>
<p>Current projects (as of August 2010) include continued planning for a new residence hall and a recreation and athletics center, construction of a new tennis complex on the Elizabeth campus, and construction of a large parking lot on the main campus.
In addition, Roanoke has recently purchased a significant number of private homes on Market Street adjacent to campus, which will provide land for future college growth.</p>

<h3>Football</h3>
<p>Roanoke's <a>football</a> program was discontinued during <a>World War II</a> after more than 60 years of competition.
Initially a club sport, the first <a>varsity</a> game occurred in 1892 against Allegheny Institute.
Constructed for Salem's public <a>high school</a>, many hoped the college would revive its football program and that the team would play in the stadium, but the college declined.
The stadium hosts the annual <a>NCAA</a> <a>Division III</a> football championship even though Roanoke does not compete in the sport.
In 1895, Roanoke and Virginia Tech were charter members of the now defunct Virginia Intercollegiate Athletic Association along with <a>Randolph-Macon College</a>, the <a>University of Richmond</a>, and the <a>College of William and Mary</a>; and in 1926, Roanoke and Virginia Tech played the inaugural football game at Virginia Tech's <a>Miles Stadium</a>.</p>
<h3>School Colors</h3>
<p>Roanoke has two sets of <a>school colors</a>, blue and gold for academic use and maroon and gray for athletic use.
This dates to 1907 when the baseball team needed new uniforms, but could not obtain any in blue and gold.
Maroon and gray uniforms were purchased as a substitute.
Within a few years, maroon and gray were adopted as Roanoke's official athletic colors.
The college <a>athletic nickname</a> became Maroons as well.
In recent years, black has been added as an accent color so Roanoke athletic uniforms are often maroon, gray, and black.</p>
<h3>Nickname and Mascot</h3>
<p>Roanoke's <a>athletic nickname</a> is Maroons and the <a>mascot</a> is Rooney, a maroon-tailed hawk.
The mascot was revealed on April 17, 2009 during annual alumni weekend festivities.
Roanoke has competed as the Maroons for over 100 years, but it was only a color without a mascot to represent the college.</p>
<h2>In the press</h2>
<p><em><a>U.S. News and World Report</a></em> ranks Roanoke as a national liberal arts college, the <em><a>Princeton Review</a></em> lists Roanoke among the &quot;Best in the Southeast&quot;,  and the <em>Templeton Guide</em> names Roanoke as a college that encourages character development.
In 2006, <em><a>Men's Fitness</a></em> magazine named Roanoke the 19th &quot;fittest campus&quot; in the United States.
</p>
<p>In 2005, <a>George Keller</a>, a noted American expert on higher education, authored <em>Prologue to Prominence, A Half Century at Roanoke College</em>.
Roanoke was selected over four other finalists, <a>Ohio State University</a>, <a>Central Michigan University</a>, <a>Boston University</a>, and <a>Marshall University</a>.</p>
<p><em><a>The Roanoke Times</a></em> reported in July 2009 that the <a>Salem</a> <a>city council</a> denied a college request to <a>rezone</a> an apartment building adjacent to campus.
The building was purchased in 2008, renamed Afton Hall, and renovated for student housing.
The request would have allowed Roanoke to redevelop the site, and was denied after neighboring landowners voiced disagreement.
Roanoke will continue to use the building for student housing, but is limited in future development or significant changes to the site.</p>

<h2>Roanoke and the Railway</h2>
<p>The <a>Norfolk and Western Railway</a>, now <a>Norfolk Southern Corporation</a>, has provided career opportunities for many Roanoke alumni; the NWR was headquartered in <a>Roanoke</a> until 1982 and is a major employer in western Virginia.
Roanoke graduates who have advanced to leadership positions include <a>Stuart T. Saunders</a> and John P. Fishwick, former presidents of the NWR; John R. Turbyfill, retired vice-chairman, NSC; John S. Shannon, retired executive vice president, NSC; and William T. Ross, Sr., retired assistant vice president, NWR.</p>
<p>Roanoke has strong historic ties to the railway due in part to its alumni connections.
The NWR named a <a>Pullman</a> car &quot;Roanoke College&quot; in honor of the college and Fishwick's <a>Salem</a> residence is now the college President's House.
Saunders and Turbyfill served as chairman of Roanoke's board of trustees.
In 2007, <a>David R. Goode</a>, retired chairman, NSC, endowed Roanoke's Center for Learning and Teaching in honor of his father, sister, and brother-in-law, all Roanoke graduates.</p>
