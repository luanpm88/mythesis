It is affiliated with the <a>Congregation of Holy Cross</a> and is the sister school of the <a>University of Notre Dame</a>.
Founded in 1901, UP has a student body of about 3,600 students.

<pre></pre>
<p>The campus is located in the <a>University Park</a> neighborhood near <a>St.

It is the only university in Oregon to offer, at one location, a college of arts and sciences; a graduate school; and schools of business, education, engineering, and nursing.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|Waldschmidt Hall, formerly West Hall, at the University of Portland</a> The first institution located on Waud's Bluff was Portland University, a <a>Methodist Episcopal Church</a>-founded university established in 1891.
It operated until about 1898.
The next year the <a>College of Puget Sound</a>, a new university founded by the Methodist Episcopal Church, was part of Portland University.
</p>
<p>According to University of Portland tradition, Archbishop <a>Alexander Christie</a>, the head of the <a>Archdiocese of Oregon City</a>, saw a large building on the bluff from aboard a ship on the nearby <a>Willamette River</a>.
He learned that it was called West Hall and was the site of the (by then) defunct <a>Portland University</a>.
</p>
<p>With assistance from the <a>Congregation of Holy Cross</a>, the Archdiocese purchased West Hall (later renamed <a>Waldschmidt Hall</a>); the institution was renamed <strong>Columbia University</strong>, after the nearby Columbia River.
The university opened its doors on September 5, 1901, staffed with Roman Catholic priests from the archdiocese.
The 1930s also saw the St. Vincent Hospital school incorporated to the University as the School of Nursing, and the creation of the School of Business.
Second, a M.A. in Music.
The Theology department offers a Master of Arts in Pastoral Ministry through the Northwest Center for Catholic Theology in collaboration with <a>Gonzaga University</a> and the <a>Archdiocese of Portland</a>.
</p>

<h3>School of Education</h3>
<p>The University of Portland School of Education is an undergraduate and graduate program which provides graduates with a teaching license in some, but not all U.S. states.

PACE students live in community with other PACE students in Draper, Utah; Yakima, Washington; and Portland, Oregon.</p>
<h3>Shiley School of Engineering</h3>
<p>In 2007 the University of Portland was given a $12 million dollar gift (the largest in UP's history) toward the School of Engineering for its expansion and improvement from Donald and Darlene Shiley of San Diego.
<a>Donald Shiley</a> graduated from the University of Portland in 1951 with a bachelor&#x2019;s degree in engineering and eventually invented a heart valve and various medical devices that have been credited with saving thousands of lives.</p>
<h3>School of Nursing</h3>
<p>The current school of nursing was established in 1934 when the <a>St.
Vincent Hospital</a> School of Nursing became part of the University.
Today most clinical practice takes place at St. Vincent's and other hospitals associated with <a>Providence Health %26 Services</a>, a not-for-profit Catholic health care ministry.

<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p> [[Image:ChilesCenter.png|thumb|The [[Chiles Center]] dome, home of Pilot basketball]] UP's <a>NCAA</a> soccer program gained notoriety after <a>Clive Charles</a>, who started coaching the men's team in 1986, added the women's head coaching job in 1989, heading both teams until his death in 2003.
The women's team won the NCAA Division I National Championship in 2002 and 2005, led both years by current <a>Canadian international</a> star <a>Christine Sinclair</a>.
Four current <a>US men's internationals</a>, <a>Conor Casey</a>, <a>Steve Cherundolo</a>, <a>Heath Pearce</a> and <a>Kasey Keller</a>, also attended the University of Portland, as did longtime <a>US women's internationals</a> <a>Shannon MacMillan</a> and <a>Tiffeny Milbrett</a> and current women's international players <a>Stephanie Lopez</a> and <a>Megan Rapinoe</a>.
After his death Charles was replaced by his assistant <a>Bill Irwin</a>.
Home matches are played at 4,892-seat <a>Merlo Field</a>, part of the Clive Charles Soccer Complex on campus.
The University of Portland's soccer team is one of the oldest college programs in the U.S., going back to 1910, and was played as a club sport almost continually until 1977, when it gained full varsity status.
</p>
<p>Beyond soccer, UP also boasts one of the nation's top NCAA Division I men's cross country teams.
Coached by Rob Conner, the Pilots have won 31 straight <a>West Coast Conference</a> Championships, one of the longest active conference championship streaks in the NCAA.
On the national level, UP has finished in the top ten at the NCAA Championships four times.
In 2008, the Pilots placed 7th in the nation, matching their placing from 2001, also the highest finish ever for the team.
Individually, Portland has had such standouts as Uli Steidl, John Moore, Michael Kilburg, and most notably, David Kinsella.
In 2008, the same year as the 7th place team finish, Kinsella ended up 4th at the NCAA nationals, marking the highest individual finish ever for a UP runner at a national championship.</p>
<p>Other intercollegiate sports at UP include basketball, baseball, volleyball, track and field, tennis, and golf.
(In November 2010, the school announced it would add women's crew effective with the 2011-12 academic year, while dropping both men's and women's golf.)
While none of these teams have the standing of the soccer program, the men's cross country program has won 31 conference titles in a row and has come into its own nationally over the past few years.
In November 2005, the University of Portland stood at 25th in <em>Sports Illustrated<strong>s College All Sport rankings.
UP's previously sponsored football program was disbanded in 1950 due to lack of funding.</strong></em></p>
<p>Students participate in club level sports such as men's and women's lacrosse, ultimate frisbee, crew, and water polo, as well as a variety of intramural sports.</p>
<h2>Expansion and development</h2>
<p>The school is undergoing expansion and renovations for both its campus housing facilities and academic buildings.
For housing, two new residence halls (Fields and Schoenfeldt) were completed for the 2009-2010 school year, while two existing residence halls are in the process of being renovated.
The university is in the process of renovating the existing dining facility known as The Commons.</p>
<p>In academics, the Engineering Building was renovated using a $12 million dollar gift for its expansion and improvement from Donald and Darlene Shiley.
Additionally, the university has proposed building a new library to replace the current Wilson W. Clark Memorial Library.
Elsewhere, a bell tower located adjacent to the Christ the Teacher Chapel was completed in September 2009.
At 100 feet, it is the tallest structure on campus, as well as in North Portland, a title that Mehling Hall held previously.</p>
