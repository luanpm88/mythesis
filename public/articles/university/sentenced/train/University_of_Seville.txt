<p> <a>thumb|right|University's main building</a> The <strong>Universidad de Sevilla</strong> or <strong>University of Seville</strong>, in <a>English</a>, is a top-ranked European <a>university</a> in <a>Seville</a>, <a>Spain</a>.
Founded under the name of Colegio Santa Mar&#x00ed;a de Jes&#x00fa;s in 1505, the University of Seville, with a student body of over 50,000, is one of the top-ranked universities in the country.
It is located in the 2,000-year old artistic, cultural, and financial capital of southern Spain situated on the plain of the River Guadalquivir.
The building itself dates back to the 15th century when the Catholic Monarchs recovered the area from the Moors, a history reflected in its architecture.
It is located centrally in the city next to the prestigious Hotel Alfonso XIII which hosts Europe's royalty and international celebrities.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The University of Seville is steeped in history and is one of the most important cultural centers in Spain, dating back to the 15th century when the Catholic Monarchs recovered the area from the Moors.
It was originally the Colegio de Santa Mari&#x00ad;a de Jesus which had been created by Arcediano Maese Rodrigo Fernandez de Santaella and was confirmed as a practising university in 1555 by the papal bull of Pope Julius II.
Today, the University of Seville is well known for its vital research in Technology and Science which not only aids the development of science as a whole but, more importantly, enriches and develops not only the culture of Seville but all of Andalusia..</p>
<p>In the middle of the thirteenth century the Dominicans, in order to prepare missionaries for work among the Moors and Jews, organized schools for the teaching of Arabic, Hebrew, and Greek.
To co-operate in this work and to enhance the prestige of Seville, Alfonso the Wise in 1254 established in that city &quot;general schools&quot; (escuelas generales) of Arabic and Latin.
Alexander IV, by Bull of 21 June 1260, recognized this foundation as a generale litterarum studium and granted its members certain dispensations in the matter of residence.
Later, the cathedral chapter established ecclesiastical studies in the College of San Miguel.
Rodrigo de Santaello, archdeacon of the cathedral and commonly known as Maese Rodrigo, began the construction of a building for a university in 1472; in 1502 the Catholic Majesties published the royal decree creating the university, and in 1505 Julius II granted the Bull of authorization; in 1509 the college of Maese Rodrigo was finally installed in its own building, under the name of Santa Mar&#x00ed;a de Jes&#x00fa;s, but its courses were not opened until 1516.
The Catholic Majesties and the pope granted the power to confer degrees in logic, philosophy, theology, and canon and civil law.
The colegio mayor de Maese Rodrigo and the university proper, although housed in the same building, never lost their several identities, as is shown by the fact that, in the eighteenth century, the university was moved to the College of San Hermanegildo, while that of Maese Rodrigo remained independent, although languishing.</p>
<h2>Influence</h2>
<p>The influence of the University of Seville, from the ecclesiastical point of view, though not equal to that of the Universities of Salamanca and of Alcal&#x00e1;, was nevertheless considerable.
From its lecture halls came Sebasti&#x00e1;n Antonio de Cort&#x00e9;s, Riquelme, Rioja, Luis Germ&#x00e1;n y Rib&#x00f3;n, founder of the Horatian Academy, Juan S&#x00e1;nchez, professor of mathematics at San Telmo, Mart&#x00ed;n Alberto Carbajal, Cardinal Belluga, Cardinal Francisco Solis Folch, Marcelo Doye y Pelarte, Bernardo de Torrijos, Francisco Aguilar Ribon, the Abate Marchena, Alberto Lista, and many others who shone in the magistracy, or were distinguished ecclesiastics.
The influence of the University of Seville on the development of the fine arts, was very great.
In its shadow the school of the famous master Juan de Mal Lara was founded, and intellects like those of Herrera, Arguijo, and many others were developed, while there were formed literary and artistic clubs, like that of Pacheco, which was a school for both painting and poetry.
During the period of secularization and sequestration (1845&#x2013;57) the University of Seville passed into the control of the State and received a new organization.
At present it comprises the faculties of philosophy and letters, law, sciences, and medicine, with an enrolment (1910) of 1100 students.
</p>
<p>At the same time that the royal university was established, there was developed the Universidad de Mareantes (university of sea-farers), in which body the Catholic Majesties, by a royal decree of 1503, established the Casa de Contrataci&#x00f3;n with classes of pilots and of seamen, and courses in cosmography, mathematics, military tactics, and artillery.
This establishment was of incalculable importance, for it was there that the expeditions to the Indies were organized, and there that the great Spanish sailors were educated.
This species of polytechnic school, which, according to Eden, Bourn&#x00e9;, and Humboldt, taught a great deal to Europe, following the fortunes of Spanish science, fell into decay in the seventeenth century.

<h2>Equality, Liberty, Justice and Pluralism</h2>
<p>The university takes pride in its self-government and independence but, above all, in its ability to provide a service at such a high standard due to the calibre of the professors and lecturers that teach there.
This motivation is reflected in their ancient motto with the four qualities that the university lives by:<code>Equality, Liberty, Justice and Pluralism&#x00b4;.
This motto applies to both teaching and learning but above all, the progress made in science, technology and culture.
</code></p>
<p>At present, the university's main aim is to continue with the innovations developed in the scientific and technological fields as they look towards the future with a new and exciting perspective.
This is reflected by the number of degrees offered; students attending the university have the choice of 65 different subjects and one of the widest ranges of academic and sporting facilities in Spain, making it a very popular university for both Spanish and international students.</p>
<p>In 2004 it had 73,350 <a>student</a>s scattered around different <a>campus</a>es, being the second Spanish presential university by number of students.</p>
<h2>Campus Internationalization</h2>
<p>Since 1994, North American study abroad students have been able to take classes taught by University of Seville faculty members in Spanish in the Faculty of Philology and the Faculty of Geography and History.
As of Fall 2009, the university has agreements with 15 international organizations like the <a>Council on International Educational Exchange</a>, the <a>College Consortium for International Studies</a>, <a>International Studies Abroad</a>, <a>SUNY New Paltz</a> and <a>Wells College</a>.</p>

<p>The main building of University of Seville is known as the &quot;Old Tobacco Factory&quot;, because of the building's original use.
Built in the 18th century, Seville's tobacco factory was the largest industrial building in the world at that time and it remained a tobacco factory until the 1950s.
This beautiful building is also the setting for the very well-known opera by <a>Bizet</a>, <a>Carmen</a>.
Carmen was a fictional worker in the tobacco factory, the original story being a novella by Prosper M&#x00e9;rim&#x00e9;e <a>Prosper M&#x00e9;rim&#x00e9;e</a>.  This building houses two of the university's faculties: the School of Literature &amp; Philology and the School of Geography &amp; History.</p>
