<p>Liberty University continues to invest heavily in capital projects.
Liberty University's Campus East housing complex now boasts 30 new multi-story apartment style <a>dormitories</a>, the last six of which were completed in 2007.
Students living in these dormitories can cook meals in their own kitchen, and enjoy a <a>living room</a> and private baths.
There is a <a>clubhouse</a> which offers a <a>swimming pool</a>, <a>billiards</a> room, <a>computer</a> lab, private theater, and a <a>convenience store</a>.
A tunnel connecting the east and west ends of the campus was completed in 2004.
A second tunnel is scheduled to be completed in the near future to provide safe pedestrian passage under the Norfolk and Southern Railroad and access nearby shopping opportunities at <a>Wal-Mart</a> as well as the Wards Crossing retail stores.
In addition, a campus bus/shuttle system was added in the fall of 2006, providing transportation both on and off campus until midnight most evenings.</p>
<p>The facilities at Liberty University include the  LaHaye Student Center, which boasts a lounge, basketball courts, cardio and weight Rooms, cafe, multi-purpose rooms, aerobic rooms and other amenities.
The adjacent Tilley Center features TV lounges, game tables, pool room, and social areas as well as a stage for frequent student performances, bands and small concerts.
Other projects include a 60-mile <a>Mountain bike</a> trail system, a <a>motorcross</a> facility, <a>paintball</a> fields, 3D <a>archery</a> range, intramural sports program and several club sports such as LU <a>ice hockey</a>, which plays in an ice rink donated by Drs.
<a>Tim</a> and <a>Beverly LaHaye</a>, and a new indoor soccer facility.</p>
<p>Williams Stadium, home of the Liberty Flames football program, received a major upgrade in 2010 with the first phase of a construction project.
Seating for this phase increased from 12,000 to 19,200.
Changes to the stadium include luxury suites, a Club level and a new media area.
Additional phases of stadium expansion will increase seating to 30,000 by 2015.
</p>
<p>Construction was completed in August 2009 on the Liberty Mountain Snowflex Centre, a synthetic ski slope that features <a>Snowflex</a>, which was designed by England&#x2019;s Briton Engineering.
The Snowflex Centre includes beginner, intermediate and advanced slopes and is the first of its kind in the United States.
</p>
<p>On September 24, 2010, Liberty opened the new Tower Theater.
The theater is state of the art and has the ability to seat up to 640 people.
The Theater Department at Liberty has arranged for the 2010-11 theater season, with their opening show being Hairspray, and closing in Spring 2011 with The Phantom of the Opera.
Liberty University is the first school to receive the rights to perform either of these productions.</p>

<h3>Faculty</h3>
<h2>Accreditation</h2>
<p>Liberty was founded in 1971 and received <a>Southern Association of Colleges and Schools</a> (SACS) accreditation in 1980, which was most recently reaffirmed in 2006.
In addition, it was accredited by the <a>Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools</a> (TRACS) in September 1984, but resigned its TRACS accreditation on November 6, 2008.
Liberty has 60 accredited degree granting programs.
The law school, which opened in August of 2004, gained provisional accreditation from the <a>American Bar Association</a> on February 13, 2006.
On December 9, 2009, Chancellor Jerry Falwell Jr announced that &quot;Liberty University has received Level VI accreditation from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS).
This is the highest classification from SACS and is reserved for colleges and universities that offer four or more doctoral degrees.
The law school received full ABA accreditation on August 5th 2010.</p>
<h2>Academics and rankings</h2>
<p><a>200px|thumb|Liberty's DeMoss Hall, the campus's main academic building exhibiting faux-Jeffersonian architecture.</a>
As of February 2009, Liberty offers 71 majors and specializations and among those offered are <a>Aeronautics</a>, <a>Philosophy and Religion</a>, English, <a>Worship &amp; Music Ministry</a>, <a>Business</a>, <a>Criminal Justice</a>, <a>Education</a> and <a>Nursing</a>.
The university's Distance Learning Program offers 36 degree programs.</p>
<p>The acceptance rate for students entering LU in 2009 was 20% (not including the 100% acceptance rate for online students); the 25th-75th SAT percentile ranges for 2008 freshmen were 430-540 for critical reading and 420-530 for math, according to U.S. News &amp; World Report.</p>
<p>Liberty University also offers a <a>School of Aeronautics</a>,</p>
<p>According to the U.S. News and World Report, Liberty University's ranking in the 2011 edition of Best Colleges is Regional Universities (South), Tier 2.  It had been in Tier 4 until US New and World Report eliminated that tier   For comparison purposes, other universities in Tier 2 include <a>Christopher Newport University</a>, <a>Evangel University</a>, and <a>Ferrum College</a>.</p>
<p>In 2005, <em><a>Barron</a>'s Profiles of American Colleges</em> ranked LU as a &quot;competitive&quot; college.</p>
<p>In 2007 <a>Liberty University School of Law</a>, provisionally approved by the <a>American Bar Association</a>, announced an 89% Bar passage rate from its first graduating class of Law Students.
The bar passage rate far exceeded the State Average of 72%.</p>
<p>In 2008 the <a>School of Law</a> announced a 94.4% first time passage rate on the <a>Virginia</a> <a>Bar Exam</a>, second only to the <a>University of Virginia</a> </p>
<p>In 2009 the School of Business at Liberty University entered candidacy for full accreditation from the <a>Association of Collegiate Business Schools and Programs</a>.</p>
<p>In 2010 the <a>Liberty University School of Education</a> received full accreditation from the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE) </p>
<p>In 2010, the American Bar Association Council of the Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar awarded <a>Liberty University School of Law</a> full accreditation.</p>
<p>Liberty University has an online component which is called LU Online, previously the Distance Learning Program (DLP).
This component provides degrees from Associates level to Doctorate.
The online component runs unilaterally with the semester programme of the brick and mortar component of Liberty University.
The difference is that LU Online only enables the student to take 16-week, or semester long, courses for a few of their cataloged courses while the remainder are taken in 8-week subterms which are title B, C, and D. The subterms run chronological 8-week sessions which provide the student the ability to take 8 week sessions while only overlapping for one three week period for the remaining 3-weeks and first 3-weeks of any given course.
There is a separation at the 600-level and above where those courses are only offered in the B and D terms.</p>
<h2>Extracurricular activities</h2>
<h3>Athletics</h3>
<p> <a>thumb|Liberty Flames logo</a></p>
<p>The Liberty Flames are a member of the <a>NCAA</a> Division I Football Championships Subdivision (FCS) in football (formerly Division I-AA) and NCAA <a>NCAA</a> <a>Division I</a> sports level in other competition.
Liberty is a member of the <a>Big South Conference</a> for 18 sports.
Women's Lacrosse competes in the National Lacrosse Conference, while Women's Swimming will join the Coastal Collegiate Swimming Association, bringing the university total to 20 sports for the 2010/2011 season.
The University regularly competes for the <a>Sasser Cup</a> which is the Big South's trophy for the university which has the best sports program among the member institutions.
Liberty has won the Sasser Cup six times, second only to <a>Coastal Carolina University</a>, which has won it seven times.
In addition, Liberty University students won the inaugural Big South Conference Quiz Bowl competition in 2006, and won again in 2007.</p>
<h3>Debate</h3>
<p>Liberty's <a>Inter-Collegiate policy debate</a> program, formerly led by Brett O'Donnell, was number one in the overall rankings Championships in the <a>National Debate Tournament</a> for 2005, 2006, and 2007.
The touting of this by Liberty and in the press has led to controversy, as the overall ranking included results for novice and junior varsity debates.
In varsity rankings, Liberty was 20th in 2005, 17th in 2006, and 24th in 2007.</p>
<p>Criticism of the debate program extends to the Christian community as well.
<a>John Lofton</a> of <em><a>The American View</a></em> Christian radio show accused Liberty University of not being &quot;a truly Christian college&quot; when Jerry Falwell gave permission for the debate team to debate in favor of abortion when required.
The issue arose when the team was faced with the need to argue for abortion rights or give up the debate program for that year.</p>
<h2>Finances</h2>
<p>In the past, the institution faced a series of financial crises.
Today, the university is self sustaining and financially independent.
Total enrollment has increased to 12,000 students residentially, and to more than 50,000 students in their distance learning program in the past five years.
Tuition has also increased significantly during this time, though not at a pace that exceeds tuition increases at other schools.
In 2007 Liberty was between $20 and $25 million in debt, but when Falwell died in May 2007, he had a $34 million insurance policy, which was used to pay off the debt.
In January 2009, Chancellor Jerry Falwell Jr. announced the university's plans to freeze tuition for Liberty University Online and lower tuition for residential students for the 2009-2010 academic year.</p>
<p>Liberty has $530 million in net assets, which is expected by Chancellor Falwell to rise to 1 billion Dollars by 2014.
On December 7, 2010, Liberty sold $120 million in facilities bonds which will be used to finance recent and future expansion.

<h2>Controversy</h2>
<p><a>thumb|350px|The initials of Liberty University, on Candlers Mountain, as viewed from near campus.</a></p>
<h3>1972 Securities and Exchange Commission investigation</h3>
<p><a>Jerry Falwell</a> started Lynchburg Baptist College by selling bonds to a small group of private investors.
However, in 1972, the <a>Securities and Exchange Commission</a> investigated the bonds alleging Falwell's church committed &quot;fraud and deceit&quot; in the issuance of $6.5 million in unsecured church bonds.
The church won a 1973 federal court case prosecuted at the behest of the SEC, in which the Court exonerated the church and ruled that there had been no intentional wrong-doing.</p>
<h3>1989 bond issue</h3>
<p>In 1989, Liberty University applied for $60 million in low interest bonds through the Lynchburg Industrial Development Authority.
After the required public hearing period the bond issue was voted upon by the IDA and approved.
Shortly thereafter litigation was brought against the IDA and Liberty University by Americans United (AU) and a decision (Habel vs. Lynchburg Industrial Development Authority) was handed down in 1991 denying Liberty the bond issuance.
It was ruled that Liberty was too pervasively religious and therefore was not eligible for the bonds.</p>
<p>This case dealt a severe financial blow to the University which was unable to fund its construction projects needed to sustain its rapid growth.
A subsequent case a few years later involving <a>Regent University</a> was decided in a similar manner, but was later overturned.
The Virginia Supreme Court reviewed the case and based its decision on a more recent US Supreme Court ruling concerning issues of Separation and Sectarianism.
Since then, Regent has received approval for bond funding with the stipulation that it may not fund the Divinity School.</p>
<p>During this same period of time, the scandal surrounding <a>PTL</a> Ministries and involving TV evangelist <a>Jim Bakker</a> and later a similar discovery of improprieties by <a>Jimmy Swaggart</a> led to a severe downturn in charitable giving to televangelism organizations such as Falwell's, which resulted in a decline of contributions to the fledgling University.</p>
<h3>1994 debt buy-out</h3>
<p><a>Sun Myung Moon</a>, founder of the <a>Unification Church</a> and the <em><a>Washington Times</a></em>, and his wife <a>Hak Ja Han</a> helped to financially stabilize the University through two of his organizations: <a>News World Communications</a> (an international media conglomerate which owns the <em>Times</em> and other news media), which provided a $400,000 loan to the University at 6% interest; and the <a>Women's Federation for World Peace</a>, which indirectly contributed $3.5 million toward the school's debt.
Liberty University spokesman Mark DeMoss said the school was not aware of News World's connection to Moon when it obtained the loan through a broker.
&quot;I'm not going to be pious and tell you we would have turned it down,&quot; DeMoss said.
&quot;Because it was a business transaction, we probably would have moved forward even if Falwell or somebody in the organization knew who News World Communications was.&quot;</p>
<h3>2005 Equality Ride</h3>
<p>Liberty made news in 2005 when students from the <a>Equality Ride</a> visited the university and spoke informally with Liberty students.
According to organizers, they were turned away from the library when they tried to donate books about <a>homosexuality</a>.
The organizers were also unable to turn over to Jerry Falwell, the founder and chancellor of the university, anonymous letters from alleged current students at Liberty who claim they are gay.
They were, however, able to speak with some of the students who attend the school.
In March 2006, the Equality Ride returned, resulting in 24 arrests for trespassing when they attempted to cross into campus property after being warned not to.
</p>
<p>Don Egle, director of public relations at Liberty, said, &quot;We don&#x2019;t feel that this situation warrants a comment.&quot;
Jake Reitan, director of youth programs for <a>Soulforce</a>, said that the group requested the library accept books that could be added &quot;that students could decide to read or not&quot;, and called for the University to designate some place on campus where students could talk about being gay without fear of being expelled or having their parents informed.</p>
<p>In early 2005, SoulForce asked to return and was granted permission by Liberty University to sit in quiet protest in one of Liberty University's weekly convocations.
</p>
<p>In April 2006, Falwell allowed Reform Rabbi <a>Eric Yoffie</a> to speak at the university on behalf of gay rights citing legal protections for gay couples.
&quot;You oppose gay marriage while we believe in legal protection for gay couples.
We understand your reading of the Biblical texts, even if we read those texts in a different way.&quot;
Falwell said Yoffie's tone was as important as his message.
&quot;He came across in a loving, respectful way.&quot;
Students were not responsive, welcoming Rabbi Yioffie with &quot;shocked murmurs, scattered hisses, and boos at the packed campus stadium in Lynchburg, Va.
Falwell chastised his students, telling them he had never been booed in a synagogue.
and expressed interest in common ground.&quot;
In biology classes students are taught both <a>creationism</a> and <a>evolution</a> and that <a>creationism</a> offers a better explanation of biological diversity than <a>evolution</a>.</p>
<p>In October, 2006 the university published an advertisement in <a>The Chronicle of Higher Education</a> in an attempt to recruit staff to its biology department.
The advertisement stated that the university was &quot;seeking faculty who can demonstrate a personal faith commitment to its evangelical Christian purpose&quot; and specified that &quot;compatibility with a young-earth creationist philosophy [is] required.&quot;</p>
<p>In the same month, <a>Richard Dawkins</a> was quoted saying the following about Liberty University; &quot;If it's really true that the museum of Liberty University has dinosaur fossils which are labeled as being 3,000 years old, then that is an educational disgrace.
It is debauching the whole idea of a university, and I would strongly encourage any members of Liberty University who may be here, to leave and go to a proper university.&quot;</p>
<p>In December, 1991 <em>Creation</em> reported, Arlton C. Murray &quot;excavated a dinosaur for Liberty University&#x2019;s museum&quot;, which proclaimed &quot;this dinosaur was the first of its kind in any creationist museum.&quot;</p>
<p>Liberty professor <a>Marcus R. Ross</a> was featured in a report on creationism.
Ross &quot;believes that the Bible is a literally true account of the creation of the universe and that the earth is at most 10,000 years old.&quot;
This is in contrast to his previous position as reflected when he earned his Ph.D. in geosciences from <a>University of Rhode Island</a> with a dissertation about &quot;the abundance and spread of <a>mosasaurs</a>, marine reptiles that, as he wrote, vanished at the end of the <a>Cretaceous</a> era about 65 million years ago.&quot;</p>
<h3>Political clubs</h3>
<p>On May 15, 2009, vice president of student affairs Mark Hine sent an e-mail to the president of LU's <a>College Democrats</a>, Brian O'nill Diaz, revoking the university's recognition of the club.
&quot;The <a>Democratic Party</a> platform is contrary to the mission of Liberty University and to <a>Christian</a> doctrine,&quot; Hine's e-mail stated, citing the party's positions on <a>abortion</a>, <a>same-sex marriage</a>, <a>hate crimes</a>, <a>LGBT</a> civil rights, and <a>socialism</a> as justification for the dissolution.
While the club can still meet on campus, it cannot use the university's name or reserve university facilities.
</p>
<p>At a meeting with Administration officials, the group was asked to publicly apologize for statements they had made to the media about this controversy.
The head of the LU College Democrats, <a>Brian O'nill Diaz</a>, was quoted as saying he was baffled by the administration's decision, &quot;I want to be able to share the love of Christ, but I guess I can't do that on campus because I'm a Democrat as well.&quot;
</p>
<p>Chairman of the <a>Democratic National Committee</a> and Democratic ex-governor <a>Tim Kaine</a> and former gubernatorial candidates <a>Terry McAuliffe</a>, <a>Brian Moran</a> and <a>Creigh Deeds</a> called on the college to rescind the ban.
Republican governor <a>Robert McDonnell</a> stated that he &quot;personally disagrees&quot; with Liberty's decision, but that because it is a private school, its leaders can make their own decisions.
On May 28, 2009, members of the Club met with officials at Liberty University, and Falwell stated that he was &#x201c;optimistic that if the university can work directly with the students that a compromise can be reached.&#x201d;
Dean Hine said that, while the e mail was not clear, he did explain to the College Democrats leadership at the time he sent the e mail that the group could continue to meet in common areas on campus.
</p>
<p>Liberty's decision has led some to question the University's tax-exempt status, and <a>Americans United for Separation of Church and State</a> has filed a complaint with the <a>Internal Revenue Service</a>, asking for a review of the university&#x2019;s tax status.
Liberty University in turn filed a complaint with the IRS regarding the tax-exempt status of <a>Americans United for Separation of Church and State</a>.
</p>
<p>In late June, Liberty University announced a new policy dealing with all political clubs on campus.
The new policy removes official recognition from all political clubs on campus, relegating them to unofficial status.
Chancellor Falwell said the previously suspended College Democrats &#x201c;wouldn&#x2019;t have to do anything&#x201d; to be recognized under the new policy.
Along with other stipulations, the policy allows unofficial clubs to use the university&#x2019;s name, but they will not receive any college funding.
Democratic Governor Tim Kaine was quoted as saying that Liberty University solved the club controversy &quot;perfectly.&quot;
</p>
<h3>Ergun Caner</h3>
<p>On May 10, 2010, Liberty University announced that it would launch a formal inquiry into allegations of discrepancies in the claimed background of <a>Ergun Caner</a>, the Dean and President of the Liberty Baptist Theological Seminary and Graduate School.
The move came in response to media allegations pointing to several factual discrepancies about Caner's supposed upbringing as a devout <a>Sunni</a> Muslim in <a>Turkey</a>, and his claims of debating several Muslim apologists.
The divorce records of Caner's parents show that his family moved to Ohio when he was 3 or 4, contradicting Caner's claim of living as a teenager in Turkey.
Ergun Caner has stated &quot;I am thrilled that Liberty University is forming this committee, and I look forward to this entire process coming to a close.&quot;
On June 25, 2010, Liberty University removed Caner from his position as Dean of the seminary, after finding &quot;discrepancies related to the matters such as dates, names and places of residence.&quot;
Liberty University did however decide to retain Caner as a full time faculty member of the seminary for the 2010-2011 school year.
Liberty University released a statement on July 2, 2010, appointing Dr. Dan Mitchell as Interim Dean of the Liberty Baptist Theological Seminary and Graduate School.
On August 25, 2010 Liberty University announced that co-founder of Liberty University, Dr. Elmer Towns would take over as Dean of the Liberty Baptist Theological Seminary while maintaining his status as Dean of the B.R. Lakin School of Religion.</p>
