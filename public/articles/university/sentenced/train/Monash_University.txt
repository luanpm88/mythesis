<h2>History</h2>
<p></p>
<h3>Beginnings</h3>
<p>Monash University is a commissioned Victorian university.
It was established by an Act of the State <a>Parliament of Victoria</a> in 1958 as a result of the Murray Report which was commissioned in 1957 by then Prime Minister <a>Robert Menzies</a> to establish the second university in the state of <a>Victoria</a>.
The university was named after the prominent Australian general <a>Sir John Monash</a>.
This was the first time in Australia that a university had been named after a person, rather than a city or state.</p>
<p><a>right|thumb|250px|One of the lakes at the University's main campus, Clayton</a> The original campus was in the south-eastern Melbourne suburb of <a>Clayton</a> (falling in what is now the <a>City of Monash</a>).
The first University Council, led by Monash's first Chancellor <a>Sir Robert Blackwood</a>, selected Sir <a>Louis Matheson</a>, to be the first Vice-Chancellor of Monash University, a position he held until 1976.
The University was granted an expansive site of 100 hectares of open land in Clayton.</p>
<p>From its first intake of 347 students at Clayton on 13 March 1961, the university grew rapidly in size and student numbers so that by 1967, it had enrolled more than 21,000 students since its establishment.
In its early years, it offered undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in engineering, medicine, science, arts, economics, politics, education and law.
It was a major provider for international student places under the <a>Colombo Plan</a>, which saw the first Asian students enter the Australian education system.</p>
<p>In its early years of teaching, research and administration, Monash was not disadvantaged by entrenched traditional practices.
Monash was able to adopt modern approaches without resistance from those who preferred the status quo.
A modern administrative structure was set up; Australia's first research centres and scholarships devoted to <a>Indigenous Australians</a> were established, and, thanks to Monash's entirely new facilities, students in wheelchairs could enroll.</p>
<h3>1970s onwards</h3>
<p>From the mid-1960s to the early 1970s, Monash became the centre of <a>student radicalism</a> in Australia.
It was the site of many mass student demonstrations, particularly concerning Australia's role in <a>Vietnam War</a> and <a>conscription</a>.
By the late 1960s, several student organisations, some of which were influenced by or supporters of communism, turned their focus to Vietnam, with numerous blockades and sit-ins.</p>
<p>In the late 1970s and 1980s, Monash's most publicised research came through its pioneering of <a>in-vitro fertilisation</a> (IVF).
Led by Professors <a>Carl Wood</a> and <a>Alan Trounson</a>, the Monash IVF Program achieved the world's first clinical IVF pregnancy in 1973.
In 1980, they delivered the first IVF baby in Australia.
This eventually became a massive source of revenue for the University at a time when university funding in Australia was beginning to slow down.</p>
<p>In the late 1980s, the <a>Dawkins Reforms</a> changed the landscape of higher education in Australia.
Under the leadership of Vice-Chancellor <a>Mal Logan</a>, Monash transformed dramatically.
In 1988, Monash University had only one campus, <a>Clayton</a>, with around 15, 000 students.
Just over a decade later, it had 8 campuses (including 2 overseas), a European research and teaching centre, and more than 50,000 students, making it the largest and most internationalised Australian university.</p>
<h3>Expansion in the 1990s</h3>
<p>The expansion began in 1990, with a series of mergers between Monash, the Chisholm Institute of Technology, and the Gippsland Institute of Advanced Education.
In 1991 a merger with the Victorian College of Pharmacy created a new faculty of the University.
Monash University's expansion continued in 1994, with the establishment of the <a>Berwick campus</a>.</p>
<p>In 1998, the University opened the <a>Malaysia campus</a>, its first overseas campus and the first foreign university in <a>Malaysia</a>.
In 2001, Monash South Africa opened its doors in Johannesburg, making Monash the first foreign university in South Africa.
The same year, the University secured an 18th Century Tuscan Palace to open a research and teaching centre in <a>Prato</a>, Italy.</p>
<p>At the same time, Australian universities faced unprecedented demand for international student places, which Monash met on a larger scale than most, to the point that today around 30% of its students are from outside Australia.
Today, Monash students come from over 100 different countries, and speak over 90 different languages.
The increase in international students, combined with its expansion, meant that Monash's income skyrocketed throughout the 1990s, and it is now one of Australia's top 200 exporters.</p>
<h3>2000 onwards</h3>
<p>[[Image:Monash University Clayton Campus.jpg|left|250px|thumb|A
panorama view of [[Robert Menzies]] Building in Clayton Campus]] In recent years, the University has been prominent in medical research.
A highlight of this came in 2000, when Professor <a>Alan Trounson</a> led the team of scientists which first announced to the world that nerve stem cells could be derived from embryonic stem cells, a discovery which led to a dramatic increase in interest in the potential of <a>stem cells</a>.
It has also led to Monash being ranked in the top 20 universities in the world for biomedicine.</p>
<p>On 21 October 2002 Huan Yun &quot;Allen&quot; Xiang shot two people dead and injured five others on the Clayton campus.</p>
<p>On 30 May 2008, Monash University celebrated its 50th Anniversary.</p>
<p>The current Vice-Chancellor and President of Monash University is Professor <a>Edward Byrne AO</a> (since 6 July 2009).</p>
<h2>Campuses</h2>
<h3>Clayton campus</h3>
<p>The <a>Clayton campus</a> covers an area over 1.1&nbsp;km&#x00b2; and is the largest of the Monash campuses.

[[Australian Synchrotron]] is located at the University's Clayton Campus]] In 2001, the State Government of Victoria decided to build the first Australian <a>synchrotron</a> adjoining the campus.
The <a>Australian Synchrotron</a> opened in July 2007 and creates beam light to make it capable to view matter at the molecular level.
Monash University contributed $5M towards the $220M cost of the synchrotron as a member of the funding partnership for the initial suite of <a>beamline</a>s.</p>
<p>The campus is also home to a number of halls of residence, colleges and other on-campus accommodation that house several thousand students.
