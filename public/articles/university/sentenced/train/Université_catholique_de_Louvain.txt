<p>The <strong>Universit&#x00e9; catholique de Louvain</strong>, sometimes known as <strong>UCL</strong>, is <a>Belgium</a>'s largest <a>French</a>-speaking <a>university</a>.
It is located in <a>Louvain-la-Neuve</a> and in <a>Brussels</a>.
It split from the <a>Catholic University of Leuven</a>, Belgium's oldest university, in 1968, the Dutch half staying in <a>Leuven</a> under the name <a>Katholieke Universiteit Leuven</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p></p>
<p>The <a>Catholic University of Leuven</a>, based in <a>Leuven</a> (&quot;<em>Louvain</em>&quot; in French), 30 <a>km</a> east of <a>Brussels</a>, provided lectures in French from its refounding in 1835, and in Dutch from 1930.
In 1968 the <a>Dutch-language</a> section became an independent <a>Katholieke Universiteit Leuven</a>, which remained in Leuven, while the French-speaking university was moved to a greenfield campus, <a>Louvain-la-Neuve</a>, 20&nbsp;km south-east of Brussels, in a part of the country where French is the official language.
This separation also entailed dividing existing library holdings between the two new universities.</p>
<p>With the democratization of university education already stretching existing structures, plans to expand the French-speaking part of the university at a campus in Brussels or <a>Wallonia</a> had been quietly discussed from the early 1960s, but it had not been anticipated that the French-speaking section would become an entirely independent university and lose all its buildings and infrastructure in Leuven.
The first stone of the new campus at Louvain-la-Neuve was laid in 1971, and the transfer of faculties to the new site was completed in 1979.</p>
<h2>Campuses</h2>
<p>While the main <a>campus</a> of Universit&#x00e9; catholique de Louvain is based at <a>Louvain-la-Neuve</a>, there is however a small campus in Brussels, in <a>Woluwe-Saint-Lambert</a>, which until recently was called &quot;Louvain-en-Woluwe&quot; (the authorities of the UCL tend to prefer nowadays to refer to it as &quot;UCL-Brussels&quot;).
This satellite campus hosts the <a>faculty of medicine</a> of the university.</p>
<h2>Prospects</h2>
<p>According to a 2007 agreement, the Universit&#x00e9; Catholique de Louvain should absorb three small French-speaking catholic colleges: the <a>Facult&#x00e9;s Universitaires Notre-Dame de la Paix</a> (<a>FUNDP</a>) located in <a>Namur</a>, the <a>Facult&#x00e9;s Universitaires Saint-Louis</a> (<a>FUSL</a>) located in Brussels and the <a>Facult&#x00e9;s universitaires catholiques de Mons</a> (<a>FUCAM</a>) located in <a>Mons</a> and <a>Charleroi</a>.
Negotiations started in September 2007 and they should lead to the creation of a new university to be called Universit&#x00e9; Catholique de Louvain (UCL).
(The campuses might be identified as UCL/Brussels, UCL/Louvain-la-Neuve, UCL/Mons, UCL/Namur and UCL/Charleroi).
The four universities are already part of a common group, the &quot;Academie Louvain&quot;.
Within this group, member universities have coordinated their masters programmes in the fields of economics, management, political sciences and sciences.</p>

<h2>General credit</h2>
<p>The Universit&#x00e9; catholique de Louvain educates around 22,000 students (2003) in all areas of studies, from <a>theology</a> to <a>biology</a> and from <a>nuclear physics</a> to <a>law</a>.
It has educated a large part of Belgium's elite and is still considered, with its Dutch-speaking sister, as a centre of excellence in many fields.
In 2006, it was ranked 76th in the <a>world universities ranking</a> established by the Times higher education supplement (24th in Europe).
It is connected to Brussels by a train service, and the new town and campus is unusually architecturally interesting.</p>
<p>In the 2010 <a>QS World University Rankings</a> the Universit&#x00e9; catholique de Louvain was ranked 124th over all in the world, moving up two places from its position of joint 126th in the 2009 <a>THE&#x2013;QS World University Rankings</a> (in 2010 <a>Times Higher Education World University Rankings</a> and <a>QS World University Rankings</a> parted ways to produce separate rankings)..

<h2>Student life</h2>
<h3>Cercles</h3>
<p><em>Cercles</em> are <a>Student Societies</a> or <a>Fraternities</a> based around each faculty.
Each Cercle runs a bar.
In order to be inducted new members are paraded through the street over night in <a>hazing</a> ceremonies involving eggs and other foodstuff, paint, demeaning chants etc.</p>
<h3>Kots</h3>
<p>Student accommodation in Belgium comes in the form of a &quot;kot&quot;, a term having <a>Belgian Dutch</a> origin.
The French way to form the plural of &quot;kot&quot; is &quot;kots,&quot; though this sounds awkward to Dutch speakers, since &quot;kots&quot; means vomit in their language.
(In Dutch, the plural of &quot;kot&quot; is &quot;kotten.&quot;)
In the bilingual region of Brussels, where there are both Dutch- and French-speaking universities and their students, it is common that &quot;for rent&quot; signs are in French only, with the French plural of &quot;kot&quot;.</p>
<h3>Kot-&#x00e0;-projet</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Unique to UCL a  <a>Kot-&#x00e0;-projet</a> (kap) is a <a>kot</a> whose inhabitants have similar interests and who organise activities for the general student population, they are similar to <a>Fraternity and sorority houses</a>, but smaller in size with only the committee living in the Kot.
Being small several Kots can be situated in the same, university owned, apartment building.</p>
<h3>Student Union</h3>
<p>The AGL (General Assembly of Louvain students) is the UCL's <a>Students' union</a>.
The body comprises an <a>executive</a> Committee, and a <a>legislative</a> Council.
The Committee consists of ex-officio members: President, Vice-Presidents for Education &amp; Welfare, VP for the Medicine faculty (Situated in <a>Woluwe-Saint-Lambert</a>), General Secretary, Activities Officer, Communications Officer, Operations Officer, Foreign student's Officer, Cultural Officer, <a>Editor-in-Chief</a> &amp; Deputy Editor-in-Chief as well as the president of the Council.</p>
<h3>Publications</h3>
<p><em>Quinzaine</em> a University produced newsletter, and <em>La Savate</em> produced by the AGL.
Cercles also produce publications.</p>
<h3>24h V&#x00e9;lo</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The 24 Hour Cycle (24h V&#x00e9;lo) is, nominally, a <a>bicycle</a> endurance <a>road race</a> held in October, organised by  <em>CSE Animations</em> (Centre Sportif Etudiant).
While there is an elite race with teams of two, Student groups enter novelty themed multi-bike vehicles, in the shape of a Van or Whale for example, for prizes.
The quality of these designs range in terms of artistic merit, and ability to stay intact over the duration of the race.
A 240 minute race also takes place for teenagers.
The event is probably best known for what happens off the track.
Concurrent with the race is <a>Belgium</a>&#x2019;s largest student event, with concerts and stands lasting the full 24hrs.</p>
