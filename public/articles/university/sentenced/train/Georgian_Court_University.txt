The estate, which the Goulds named <em>Georgian Court</em>, was built by New York architect, <a>Bruce Price</a>.
Price designed three of the gardens that remain on the campus today - the Italian Garden, the Sunken Garden, and the Formal Garden, while Takeo Shiota designed the peaceful Japanese Garden.
In addition to the gardens, GCU has maintained much of the original architecture and it is also home to the <a>Sister Mary Grace Burns Arboretum</a>.
The name of Georgian Court University is derived from its architectural style, i.e.
Georgian.</p>
