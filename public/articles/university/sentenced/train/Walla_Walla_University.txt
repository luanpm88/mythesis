<p> <strong>Walla Walla University</strong>, known as <strong>Walla Walla College</strong> prior to September 2007, is a college offering <a>liberal arts</a>, professional, and technical programs.
It is affiliated with the <a>Seventh-day Adventist Church</a>.
Walla Walla University (WWU) is located in southeast <a>Washington</a> in the town of <a>College Place</a>, just a few miles from <a>Walla Walla</a>.
It is one of 10 private colleges in the state of Washington, and one of 14 colleges and universities operated by the Seventh-day Adventist Church in the <a>United States</a>.
It is overseen by President John McVay.
Although Walla Walla University is outside of Walla Walla, it is often mistaken for <a>Walla Walla Community College</a>, and sometimes <a>Whitman College</a>, both of which are actually in Walla Walla.</p>
<p>Founded in 1892, the University has an annual enrollment of more than 1,800 students.
The main campus covers 55 acres (223,000&nbsp;m&#x00b2;) and the college also operates a 45 acre (182,000&nbsp;m&#x00b2;) marine station on <a>Fidalgo Island</a>, a nursing campus in <a>Portland, Oregon</a>, and masters of social work programs in <a>Missoula</a> and <a>Billings, Montana</a>.</p>
<h2>Academic programs</h2>
<p>The University offers six bachelor&#x2019;s degrees in 36 areas of study, seven master&#x2019;s degrees, and an associate of science degree.
</p>
<h3>Engineering</h3>
<p>The Edward F. Cross School of Engineering is a respected <a>ABET</a> accredited program that offers bachelor of science and engineering degrees in engineering with concentrations in <a>Biological</a>, <a>Civil</a>, <a>Computer</a>, <a>Electrical</a>, and <a>Mechanical Engineering</a>.
While no published research is regularly done at the school, students can take advantage of the low student to teacher ratio to get one-on-one homework assistance from the professor in almost every class.
Almost all classes are taught by the professors themselves.
The school offers access to well-funded labs to students by their second and third year of undergraduate study.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<p>The students of WWU are all organized as the Associated Students of Walla Walla University or <strong>ASWWU</strong>.
The ASWWU is funded by dues paid in proportion to college tuition, and organizes several social and spiritual events each year for the students.
ASWWU operates the student newspaper <em><a>The Collegian</a></em>, the annual <em>Mountain Ash</em> (a collection of photography, student art, and mugs), an online radio station, and the student directory the <em><a>Mask</a></em>. ASWWU is divided into three branches, the Executive, headed by the President, the Legislative (Senate), headed by the Executive Vice President, and the Judicial, headed by the Chief Justice.</p>
<p>Both the men's and the women's on-campus dormitories operate their own clubs.
The clubs are somewhat similar to a fraternity and sorority; however, all dorm residents automatically belong to these clubs.
(Off-campus students have their own Village Club as well.)
The women's club, located in Foreman Hall and Conard Hall, is named Aleph Gimel Ain (AGA); the men's club, in Sittner Hall and Meske Hall, is named Omicron Pi Sigma (OPS).</p>
<p>The University is accredited by the Northwest Association of Schools and Colleges and the Accrediting Association of Seventh-day Adventist Schools, Colleges and Universities (Adventist Accrediting Association).</p>
<h3>Sittner Hall</h3>
<p>Sittner Hall is the main men's residence hall on the Walla Walla University campus, and the home of Omicron Pi Sigma, whose motto is &quot;Be Loyal to the Royal Within You.&quot;
It is located on the northwestern end of campus, north of the Walla Walla University Church and west of the Peterson Memorial Library and Rigby Hall.
It is named after Herman R. Sittner, Dean of Men from 1927&#x2013;1937.
It was first constructed in 1946, although it has since been expanded.
The current configuration is four stories high with accommodation for approximately 410 men.
The building is divided into two wings&mdash;North and South.
Each wing on each floor is served by two <a>resident assistant</a>s.</p>
<p>The smaller of the men's dorms, Meske Hall, was named after Walt Meske, Dean of Men from 1975&#x2013;1982.</p>
<h3>Omicron Pi Sigma</h3>
<p>Omicron Pi Sigma (OPS), which dates back to April 28, 1927, is the men's club for the dormitory students of Walla Walla University in Sittner and Meske Halls.
It is similar to a fraternity; however, it is not exclusive.
All of the aforementioned students are automatically members and their club dues are included in their fees for dormitory residence.
It is run by a student president (who is elected annually and enjoys the luxury of a special presidential room in Sittner Hall) and a six-member appointed cabinet.</p>
<p>OPS operates numerous activities throughout the year, including a weekly worship in the lobby of Sittner Hall on Monday Nights, which are usually followed by games.
Other activities include Amateur Hour, Mudbowl, NFL Challenge, and the Monte Wilkins Open throughout the year.
OPS occasionally works with its sister organization, Aleph Gimel Ain (AGA), to hold joint worships several times each year.
During the 07-08 year, the ambitious officers introduced a new event simply called 'OPS Day,' a holiday celebrated on April 28, where members wear OPS apparel and party after the OPS worship that week.</p>
<p>Amateur Hour is by far the biggest single show put on by the students at Walla Walla University.
It is a talent show with about fourteen acts, ranging from secular to sacred, and is usually emceed by an individual of the cabinet's choosing.
January 26, 2008, Joe Hess (a WWC alumnus) made his return to Walla Walla by hosting Amateur Hour.
This year however, Amateur Hour is returning to its original home in the fall, with the show taking place on November 1, 2008.</p>
<h3>Foreman and Conard Halls</h3>
<p>The women's dorms on campus have seven stories (Foreman) and four stories (Conard).
The women's dorms are home to Aleph Gimel Ain.
Foreman and Conard Halls, though two separate buildings, are connected by a skywalk and share a lobby, which is located at the southeastern side of campus.
</p>
<p>Foreman Hall is named after Dorothy Foreman-Beltz, Dean of Women from 1931&#x2013;1945.
Foreman was first constructed in 1970, and houses mainly upper division women.
There are 100 double-occupancy rooms in Foreman Hall.</p>
<p>The original Conard Hall (now Meske Hall) was built in 1934 and named for Helen C. Conard who was preceptress and teacher from 1899&#x2013;1907.
Present-day Conard Hall consists of a north wing, added in 1954, and a south wing, added in 1961.
Conard Hall houses mainly lower division women.
Conard Hall is made up of 110 double-occupancy rooms.</p>
<h3>Aleph Gimel Ain</h3>
<p>Aleph Gimel Ain (AGA) is the women's club for the residents of the dormitories Foreman Hall and Conard Hall.
Like OPS, AGA organizes events during the year and holds weekly worships.</p>
<p>AGA was founded in 1928 by the women residing in Conard Hall at that time.
Foreman/Conard Hall residents are automatically a part of AGA.
Over the years, AGA has grown with the residence hall population and has become a well-known organization among WWU alumni.</p>
<p>AGA is an active club offering classic sports series, a fall mud bowl, dorm activities such as open house, weekly worships, a campus-wide events each quarter&mdash;including AGA Weekend each May, and a weekly publication (which is hung inside each bathroom stall throughout the women's dorms), &quot;The Toilet Paper.&quot;
AGA also offers specialty items for sale such as T-shirts, sportswear, hats, etc. </p>
<p>One important event that this club hosts every year is the AGA Hour of Charm.
This talent showcase program has been a part of AGA almost since its beginning, and is remembered by many alumni.
</p>
<p>In September 2007, the AGA officers elected to bring back an old tradition, and has replicated the signature pin for each member.
This pin was given to each new member at the beginning of each year as an induction into the club and somewhere over the years, this practice was lost.
It has been revived, and the club plans to continue with this tradition each year.</p>
<h3>Walla Walla Wolfpack</h3>
<p>One of the many clubs on campus is the Walla Walla Wolfpack <a>Hockey</a> Team.
A continuing tradition, &quot;the Pack&quot; competes in the <a>American Collegiate Hockey Association</a>, which includes schools such as the <a>University of Washington</a>, <a>Washington State University</a>, <a>Colorado State University</a>, <a>University of Southern California</a>, and many others.</p>
<h3>The Mask</h3>
<p> <em>The Mask</em> is the schools' <a>picture directory</a>.
It takes the form of an annual print edition and an online edition.
It contains the students, faculty, and staff of the university and categorizes into different sections.</p>
<h3>The Collegian</h3>
<p><em>The Collegian</em> is the <a>student newspaper</a> overseen by ASWWU, and is run by the Editor in Chief, who was formerly elected, now appointed by the executive branch of ASWWU and confirmed by the Senate.
The newspaper was founded in 1916, and it is currently published on every Thursday of the academic year, except for the weeks of and prior to final exams of each quarter.
Its mission is to report relevant news, discuss issues, and entertain the students of WWU.
The <em>Collegian</em> is a weekly publication and is one of the few weekly student publications in the Adventist college system.</p>
<p>Like most college newspapers, the <em>Collegian</em> features news, opinion, and humor.
Because WWU is a Seventh-day Adventist school, religion is also a topic explored regularly in its pages.
Students from the university are commissioned to write occasional articles, in addition to the regular staff.
The <em>Collegian</em> is generally free to report as it sees fit, though if the publication were to include obscene material or foul language, the college, being a private Christian university, could prevent its publication and distribution.</p>
