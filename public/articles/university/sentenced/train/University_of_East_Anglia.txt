<p> The <strong>University of East Anglia</strong> (<strong>UEA</strong>) is a <a>public</a> <a>research university</a> in <a>Norwich</a>, <a>England</a>.
The university was established in 1963, and is a founder-member of the <a>1994 Group</a> of research-intensive universities.
In 2010 the University was ranked 19th in the UK by <a>The Guardian</a> newspaper, and 68th in Europe, and 174th in the world in the <a>Times Higher Education World University Rankings</a>.
</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>UEA admitted its first students in 1963 in temporary accommodation in Earlham Hall, on the western edge of the city of Norwich about 3 miles from the city centre.
In the mid-1970s, extraction of gravel in the valley of the <a>River Yare</a>, which runs to the south of the campus, resulted in the university acquiring its own lake or &quot;<a>Broad</a>&quot; as it is often referred to.
At more or less the same time, a bequest of tribal art and 20th century painting and sculpture, by artists such as <a>Francis Bacon</a> and <a>Henry Moore</a>, from <a>Sir Robert and Lady Lisa Sainsbury</a> resulted in the construction of the striking <a>Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts</a> at the western end of the main teaching wall, one of the first major works of architect <a>Norman Foster</a>.</p>
<h2>Academic reputation</h2>
<p>[[Image:247917 3a00fec7.jpg|thumb|left|Earlham
Hall, childhood home of [[Elizabeth Fry]], is now home to <a>Norwich Law School</a>]]  The results of the latest <a>Research Assessment Exercise (RAE)</a>, published 18 December 2008, showed that over 50% of the University&#x2019;s research activity was deemed to be &quot;world leading&quot; or &quot;internationally excellent&quot;, with 87% in total being of &quot;international standing&quot;.
The university's research in the domains of American and Anglophone Area Studies, Communication, Cultural and Media Studies, and finally Development Studies places its respective Schools within the top three nationally.
UEA also boasts the highest percentage of national world leading research in History of Art, Design and Architecture.
Research in Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences along with Pharmacy places UEA within the top ten nationally.
The previous <a>2001</a> RAE ranked the Schools of Communication, Cultural and Media Studies, Environmental Sciences and History at 5*, the highest possible research ranking.
The Schools of Architecture, Biological Sciences, Chemistry, English Language and Literature, History of Art, Law, Philosophy, Pure Mathematics and Social Work were ranked at 5. </p>
<p>The postgraduate <a>Master of Arts in Creative Writing</a>, founded by <a>Sir Malcolm Bradbury</a> and <a>Sir Angus Wilson</a> in 1970 is regarded as the most respected in the United Kingdom, and admission to the programme is notoriously difficult.
The course has gone on to produce a plethora of distinguished authors, including <a>Ian McEwan</a>, <a>Kazuo Ishiguro</a>, <a>Anne Enright</a>, <a>Tash Aw</a>, <a>Andrew Miller</a>, <a>Owen Sheers</a>, <a>Tracy Chevalier</a>, <a>Trezza Azzopardi</a>, <a>Panos Karnezis</a>, and <a>Suzannah Dunn</a>.The German &#x00e9;migr&#x00e9; novelist <a>W.
G. Sebald</a> also taught in the School of Literature and Creative Writing, and founded the <a>British Centre for Literary Translation</a>, until his untimely death from a car accident, in 2001.</p>
<p>The <a>Climatic Research Unit</a>, founded in <a>1972</a> by <a>Hubert Lamb</a> in the School of Environmental Sciences has been an early centre of work for climate change research.
Publications include the recent <a>study on anthropogenic polar warming</a>.
The School was also stated to be &quot;the strongest in the world&quot; by the <a>Chief Scientific Adviser to the UK Government</a>, <a>Sir David King</a> during a lecture at the John Innes Centre in 2005.
There has, however, been some controversy over <a>alleged misconduct</a> by climate scientists at the <a>Climatic Research Unit</a> (CRU).</p>
<p>Two academics from UEA, Professor of Development Studies Katrina Brown and Professor of Economic Behaviour and Decision Theory Graham Loomes, are among six scholars in the UK to have recently received prestigious fellowships from the <a>Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)</a> that will allow them to carry out cutting-edge research in social science.
Professor Ian Diamond, ESRC Chief Executive, said &quot;These fellowships are designed to support leading social scientists working in the UK.
The scheme offers Fellows with an outstanding track record in research, the time and funding to pursue an exciting research agenda, and to carry out innovative and creative work that will have economic, social land policy impacts.
Each of the six successful individuals has an international reputation as a leader in their respective fields.&quot;
The four other  fellowship recipients were academics from <a>Cardiff University</a>, the <a>University of Essex</a>, the <a>London School of Economics</a> and the <a>University of Oxford</a>.

<h2>Union of UEA Students</h2>
<p> [[Image:moore101.jpg|thumb|155px|right|The
university's campus is home to many sculptural works, including three pieces by [[Henry Moore]]]] The UEA Union has a selection of sports clubs and societies ranging from football and rugby clubs to the independent student newspaper <a>Concrete</a>.
<a>Nexus UTV</a>, the campus television station, broadcasts news, comedy, documentaries and various other programmes, and is one of the oldest still-running student television stations in the country having been established in 1968.
Livewire 1350AM, the award winning campus radio station, which transmits to air on 1350AM in the vicinity of the University as well as broadcasting on the internet, was established in 1989.
A more recent society, 'The Campus Sustainability Initiative', founded <a>The Sustainability Initiative Fund</a> where UEA students each pay a &#x00a3;1 per year sustainability fee with the proceeds going towards sustainable projects on campus such as implementing renewable energies or energy conservation projects.
The initiative was supported by UEA students in a campus referendum with a 78% majority, and the project was inspired by a similar initiaitve at the <a>University of California, Santa Barbara</a>.</p>
<p>The UEA Student Union operates many of the services on the university campus which are open to all members of the university community and the general public.
Connected to both &quot;The Street&quot; and &quot;The Square&quot; is one of the most popular Union venues, the &quot;Union Pub and Bar&quot; which underwent extension and refurbishment at the cost of &#x00a3;1.2 million in 2002.
Other bars include &quot;The Hive&quot; (which, due to efforts from the <a>Students' Union</a>, was refurbished for the start of the 2004/05 academic year), and the &quot;Graduate Students Club&quot;.
In the same building is The LCR, known in full as either The Large  or Lower  Common Room.
The LCR is home to weekly campus discos, as well as the many touring gigs.
The students' union also run <a>The Waterfront</a> venue off campus in Norwich's King Street.</p>
<p>The UEA student body is one of the more politically active among UK universities, with turnout at ballots averaging around 20% (compared to a national average of around 15%).</p>
<h2>Recent developments</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|UEA Drama Studio</a> In 2005 the university, in partnership with the <a>University of Essex</a>, and with the support of <a>Suffolk County Council</a>, the <a>East of England Development Agency</a>, Ipswich Borough Council, Suffolk College, and the <a>Learning and Skills Council</a>, secured &#x00a3;15 million funding from the <a>Higher Education Funding Council for England</a> for the creation of a new campus in the Waterfront area of <a>Ipswich</a>, called <a>University Campus Suffolk</a> or UCS.
The campus opened in September 2007.</p>
<h3>Climatic Research Unit hacking</h3>
<p></p>
<p>In November 2009, computer <a>servers</a> at the Climatic Research Unit (a research institute within the University) were hacked, and the stolen information made public.
Over 1,000 emails, 2,000 documents, and source code were released.
Because the Climate Research Unit is a major repository for data supporting the idea of man-made <a>global warming</a> their release directly prior to the <a>2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference</a> attracted international attention and led to calls for an inquiry.</p>
