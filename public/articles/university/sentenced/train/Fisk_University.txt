<p> <strong>Fisk University</strong> is a <a>historically black university</a> founded in 1866 in <a>Nashville</a>, <a>Tennessee</a>, <a>U.S.</a>
The world-famous <a>Fisk Jubilee Singers</a> started as a group of students who performed to earn enough money to save the school at a critical time of financial shortages.
They toured to raise funds to build the first building for the education of <a>freedmen</a>.
They succeeded and funded construction of the renowned <a>Jubilee Hall</a>, now a designated <a>National Historic Landmark</a>.
The  campus is a historic district listed on the <a>National Register of Historic Places</a>.</p>
<p>In 1930, Fisk was the first African-American institution to gain accreditation by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.
Accreditations for specialized programs quickly followed.
In 1952, Fisk was the first predominantly black college to earn a <a>Phi Beta Kappa</a> charter.
Organized as the Delta of Tennessee Chapter of the <a>Phi Beta Kappa</a> National Honor Society that December, the chapter inducted its first student members on April 4, 1953.
</p>
<p>On March 12, 2008, <a>Nashville's Metro Council</a> passed a resolution declaring March 19 Fisk University Day in honor of its record of academic excellence.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>[[Image:GenCBFisk.jpg|thumb|left|upright|University namesake [[Clinton B. Fisk]]]] <a>thumb|right|A class circa 1900</a> In 1866 six months after the end of the <a>American Civil War</a>, leaders of the northern <a>American Missionary Association</a> (AMA): <a>John Ogden</a>, Reverend <a>Erastus Milo Cravath</a>, field secretary; and Reverend <a>Edward Parmelee Smith</a> founded the Fisk Free Colored School, for education of freedmen.
AMA support meant the organization tried to use its sources across the country to aid education for freedmen.
Enrollment jumped from 200 to 900 in the first several months of the school, indicating freedmen's strong desire for education, with ages of students ranging from seven to seventy.
The school was named in honor of General <a>Clinton B. Fisk</a> of the Tennessee <a>Freedmen's Bureau</a>, who made unused barracks available to the school, as well as establishing the first free schools for white and black children in Tennessee.
In addition, he endowed Fisk with a total of $30,000.
The American Missionary Association's work was supported by the <a>United Church of Christ</a>, which retains an affiliation with the university.
Fisk opened to classes on January 9, 1866.</p>
<p>With Tennessee's passage of legislation to support public education, leaders saw a need for training teachers, and Fisk University was incorporated as a <a>normal school</a> for college training in August 1867.
Cravath organized the College Department and the <a>Mozart</a> Society, the first musical organization in Tennessee.
Rising enrollment added to the needs of the university.
In 1870 Adam Knight Spence became principal of the Fisk Normal School.
To raise money for the school's education initiatives, his wife Catherine Mackie Spence traveled throughout the United States to set up mission Sunday schools in support of Fisk students, organizing endowments through the AMA.
With a strong interest in religion and the arts, Adam Spence supported the start of a student choir.
In 1871 the student choir went on a fund-raising tour in Europe; they were the start of the <a>Fisk Jubilee Singers</a>.
They raised nearly $50,000, which enabled the construction of Jubilee Hall.
The building was designated a <a>National Historic Landmark</a>.
</p>
<p>During the 1880s Fisk had an active building program, as well as expanding its curriculum offerings.
By the turn of the century, it added black teachers and staff to the university, and a second generation of free blacks entered classes.</p>
<p>Since 2004, Fisk University has been directed by its 14th president, the Honorable <a>Hazel O'Leary</a>, former <a>Secretary of Energy</a> under <a>President</a> <a>Bill Clinton</a>.
She is the second woman to serve as president of the university.
On June 25, 2008, Fisk announced that it had successfully raised $4 million during the fiscal year ending June 30.
It ended nine years of budget deficits and qualified for a <a>Mellon Foundation</a> challenge grant.
However, Fisk still faces significant financial hardship, and claims that it may need to close its doors unless its finances improve.

<h2>Music, art, and literature collections</h2>
<p>[[Image:WTN EVula 187.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Jubilee
Hall (Fisk University)]]]] Fisk University is the home of a music literature collection founded by the noted <a>Harlem Renaissance</a> figure <a>Carl Van Vechten</a>.
</p>
<h3>Alfred Stieglitz Collection</h3>
<p>In 1949, painter <a>Georgia O'Keeffe</a> facilitated the exchange of 99 paintings from the estate of her husband, <a>Alfred Stieglitz</a>.
She made an outright gift of two of her own paintings to the school.
These are on permanent display at the University's Carl Van Vechten Galleries.
</p>
<p>In 2005, mounting financial difficulties led the University trustees to vote to sell two of the paintings, O'Keeffe's &quot;Radiator Building&quot; and <a>Marsden Hartley</a>'s &quot;Painting No. 3&quot;.
(Together these were estimated to be worth up to 45 million U.S. dollars.)
However, the <a>Georgia O'Keeffe Museum</a>, the legal guardians of her estate, sued to stop the sale on the basis that the original bequest did not allow the art to be sold.
At the end of 2007 a plan to share the collection with the <a>Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art</a> to earn money was being fought in court by the O'Keeffe Museum.</p>
