<p> <strong>Alfred University</strong> is a small, comprehensive university in the <a>Village of Alfred</a> in <a>Western</a> <a>New York</a>, USA, an hour and a half south of <a>Rochester</a> and two hours southeast of <a>Buffalo</a>.
Alfred has an undergraduate population of around 2,000, and approximately 300 graduate students.
Though the institution has five separate schools and colleges, the institution's reputation is grounded in the arts and engineering.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Alfred was founded in 1836 as the <strong>Select School</strong> by <a>Seventh Day Baptist</a>s as a <a>non-sectarian</a> institution.
Unusual for the time, the school was <a>co-educational</a>.
It was also racially integrated, and enrolled its first <a>African-American</a> student and two <a>Native American</a> students in the 1850s, becoming the second college in the nation to do so.</p>
<p>The origin of the name &quot;Alfred&quot; is uncertain.
Residents of the town and students at the two schools believe that the town received its name in honor of <a>Alfred the Great</a>, king of the Saxons, although the first documented occurrence of this connection was in 1881, 73 years after the first record of the name being used.
State records which might have verified the connection between the Saxon king and the university were lost in a fire in 1911.
Regardless of whether the connection is historically accurate, Alfred University has embraced King Alfred as a <a>symbol</a> of the school's values, and a statue of the king stands in the center of the campus quad.</p>
<p>Alfred is a member of the <a>Rochester Area Colleges</a> consortium along with <a>Alfred State College</a>, the <a>University of Rochester</a>, <a>Rochester Institute of Technology</a>, <a>Saint John Fisher College</a>, <a>Roberts Wesleyan College</a>, <a>Nazareth College</a>, <a>Monroe Community College</a>, <a>SUNY Brockport</a>, and <a>SUNY Geneseo</a>.
Alfred University, together with <a>Corning Incorporated</a> and the <a>State of New York</a> created the <a>Ceramic Corridor</a>, a high-tech incubator project designed to take advantage of the emerging ceramics industry and to create new jobs.
This unique industrial development program is the only one in the United States concentrating on one single aspect of technology - high-tech ceramics - and it is the only major industrial development project centered in a rural area in the U.S.&lt;br /&gt; <a>thumb|250px|left|Aerial view of Alfred University taken in April 2006</a> Extending to the 20th and 21st centuries, Alfred has continued its progressive history of defending equal rights for members of the community.
In 1971, Alfred became only the 4th municipality in the U.S. to ban employment discrimination based on sexuality.
In the mid 1990s, the university became one of the first to strip credit for ROTC programs, which exhibit prejudice on basis of sexual orientation.
However, students attending Alfred University are still free to receive an Army ROTC contract with full tuition paid and attend military science classes through St. Bonaventure University.
Amidst the dissolution of the AU Greek System, the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity chapter at Alfred University led an overwhelmingly successful effort to ban discrimination based on religion, age, disability, and sexual orientation in the constitution of the 210 chapter international fraternity in 2002.
That action triggered several other national fraternities and sororities to follow suit.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>[[Image:Kanakadea Hall at Alfred University.jpg|thumb|right|Originally built in 1884, Kanakadea Hall served as Alfred's schoolhouse until a large fire destroyed the tower and devastated the second floor in 1907.
It was sold to Alfred University and repaired in 1908.
The exterior has since been restored to its original appearance, although the interior has been fully modernized.
The building now houses the Division of Human Studies.]]
<a>thumb|250px|right|The statue of King Alfred stands at the center of AU's quad, and is often decorated by students.

<p>Alfred University is not to be confused with the <a>SUNY College of Technology at Alfred</a>.
Although completely autonomous, both institutions have their origins in the Alfred Select School, and were heavily shaped by Boothe C. Davis.
In 1908 Davis petitioned the NY State legislature to fund the NY State College of Agriculture at Alfred University.
</p>
<p>In 1941 Alfred State College became an autonomous Junior College due to increased enrollment and increasing needs, which Alfred University could not accommodate, and in 1948 became a member of the State University of New York (SUNY) system.
Students of both schools still share a few Alfred peculiarities including: a physical education requirement for most programs, a short break in October dubbed &quot;minibreak&quot;, sharing of clubs and organizations (excluding Greek lettered organizations), and cross-registration of classes not offered at the other institution.</p>
<p>The school's mascot is the <a>Saxon</a>, a <a>knight</a> in shining armor.
Since the year 871 is when King Alfred the Great succeeded his brother, <a>Ethelred I</a> as King of <a>Wessex</a> and <a>Mercia</a> (see <a>Alfred the Great's childhood</a>), the phone exchange of Alfred University is 871 (i.e., all AU phone numbers take the form 1-607-871-xxxx).</p>
<p><a>Hot Dog Day</a> is held in early April of each year since 1972 at Alfred to raise money for local charities and community-based civic organizations.
It is a joint project with <a>Alfred State College</a> coordinated by students and staff from both schools.
Typical events include a carnival, small amusement park rides, mud olympics, concerts, a parade, and the consumption of hot dogs.
In recent years approximately $7,000 to $8,000 has been raised for charities including the local fire departments, public library, and day care centers.
</p>
<p>Alfred's <a>Davis Memorial Carillon</a>, erected in 1937 as a tribute to longtime president <a>Boothe C. Davis</a>,  can often be heard while on campus.
The bells of the <a>carillon</a>, purchased from <a>Antwerp</a>, were thought to be the oldest bells in the western hemisphere.
Research later (2004) showed that the bells were of a more recent vintage, and that Alfred had been the victim of a fraud.
On the brighter side, the non-historic nature of the bells allows the university to replace those that have poor tonal quality.
Concerts continue four times a week when school is in session (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 12:30 pm and Saturday at 4 pm), and during the summer months at least once a week.
Besides the resident carilloneur, guest carilloneurs have in the past frequently visited and played during the summer.</p>
<p>The Black Knight [<a>http://herrick.alfred.edu/special/archives/traditions/black_knight_story.shtml</a>] has been a part of Alfred University folklore for a long time.
The relic was originally part of a parlor stove in a classroom in Kanakadea Hall.
When the stove was discarded, the figure was claimed by the Class of 1908 as their mascot.
They passed it on to the Class of 1910, thus causing a &quot;war of possession&quot; between the even and odd numbered classes.
Many times over the years it disappeared and re-appeared on campus.
After a particularly long time away it was returned in 1977 and placed in the University Archives.
In 2005 it was transferred to a glass case in the Powell Campus Center along with a plaque describing its history.
Many students had heard of the Black Knight during their freshmen orientation and were delighted to have him on display.
However, after only a few months, the glass enclosure was destroyed in the middle of the night and the Black Knight stolen.
</p>
<p>Alfred University was mentioned on <a>Saturday Night Live</a> once in 1975 by host, and Alfred University alumnus, Robert Klein When Klein hosted SNL again in 1977, he talked at length about Alfred University in his monologue.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|The Miller Performing Arts Center</a> <a>thumb|right|The Powell Campus Center</a></p>
<p>Alfred is especially well-known for its programs in ceramic art, ceramic engineering, glass engineering, and has a strong astronomy program due in part to the presence on campus of the 7-telescope <a>Stull Observatory</a>, which has the largest optical telescope in <a>New York state</a>.
Asteroid <a>31113 Stull</a> was named for John Stull, founder and caretaker of the observatory.</p>
<p>There are two libraries on Alfred's campus, the <a>Herrick Memorial Library</a>, which primarily serves the private colleges, and the <a>Scholes Library</a>, which primarily serves the New York State College of Ceramics.
The <a>Schein-Joseph International Museum of Ceramic Art</a> has a collection of 8,000 ceramic objects, including both ancient and modern ceramic art and craft.</p>
<p>The Bromley-Daggett Equestrian Center, located at the Maris Cuneo Equine Park, was constructed in 2005.
It hosts equine classes, an intramural equestrian club, varsity and JV teams for both <a>English</a> and <a>Western</a> disciplines, clinics, and horse shows.
Stalls are available for boarding by university students.
The facility has an indoor arena of 16000&nbsp;ft&#x00b2; and lighted outdoor arenas of  and ; the entire property consists of  of land.</p>
<p>The Miller Performing Arts Center was dedicated in 1995.</p>
<h3>Alumni Hall</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|Alumni Hall</a> Now used primarily to house the Admissions Department, <a>Alumni Hall</a> has a place on the <a>National Register of Historic Places</a>.
The former University chapel, with cathedral ceilings, and offices far up into the cupola is a beautiful example of 19th-century American architecture in Alfred.
In the 1990s, Alumni Hall was saved through a restoration effort.
Alfred University was once associated with the Seventh Day Baptist Church, and included a school of theology.
While the religious connection no longer exists, the architecture of Alumni Hall and other buildings on campus reflect this heritage.</p>
<h2>Colleges and schools</h2>
<p>Alfred University offers over 60 majors and areas of concentration at its four colleges and schools.
Alfred's four private colleges are <a>The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences</a>, <a>The College of Business</a>, <a>The Inamori School of Engineering</a>, and <a>The Graduate School</a>.
The <a>New York State College of Ceramics</a> is a <a>statutory college</a> operated by Alfred but funded through annual <a>SUNY</a> appropriations.</p>
<p>The New York State College of Ceramics (NYSCC) consists of the School of Art and Design, with its own dean, and four state-supported materials programs cross-organized within Alfred University's School of Engineering.
The College of Ceramics is functioning technically as a &quot;holding entity&quot; (currently with an interim unit head) for the fiscal support of the state programs and the NYSCC mission.
The unit head assists with budget preparation for the two aforementioned AU schools and the NYSCC-affiliated Scholes Library of Ceramics (part of the campuswide, unified AU library system), and acts in a liaison role to SUNY.</p>
<p>The School of Art and Design, technically a subunit of the College of Ceramics but autonomously-run with its own dean, is further subdivided into divisions.
Alfred's School of Engineering (also autonomously-run with its own dean) currently has four state-supported programs and two privately-endowed programs.</p>
<p>On April 14, 2005, the University announced it had received a gift of $35 million from alumnus Marlin Miller '54, and his wife, Ginger, to further support arts education.
The gift is the largest ever in the university's history and is one of the largest endowment gifts made to a U.S. institution to support arts education.
Ten million dollars is earmarked for a new theatre at the Miller Performing Arts Center, previously funded by the Millers, and $25 million will go towards the endowment.</p>
<h2>Student Life</h2>
<h3>Greek social organizations</h3>
<p>Fraternities and sororities were established at Alfred University for nearly 100 years prior to 2002, when they were discontinued, partially in response to the death of <a>Zeta Beta Tau</a> (ZBT) fraternity member Benjamin Klein under suspicious circumstances and charges of gross negligence on behalf of the fraternity.</p>
<p>Prior to Klein's death, in 1978, student <a>Chuck Stenzel</a> died in a hazing-related incident at Alfred's Klan Alpine fraternity.
After Stenzel's death, his mother, Eileen Stevens, created a lobbying organization to increase awareness of <a>hazing</a> and promote anti-hazing laws, as documented in Hank Nuwer's book &quot;Broken Pledges&quot; and a later TV movie of the same name (in which Alfred was not named for legal reasons).
Stevens later served as an advisor to Alfred on hazing-related issues, and received an honorary doctorate from the school in 1999.</p>
<p>During the summer of 2002,  all <a>Greek social organizations</a> lost recognition after an in-depth analysis of the Alfred University Greek system by an eight-member task force appointed by the Board of Trustees.
More than 50% of the task force were themselves members of a fraternity or sorority while in college, and 82% of the Board of Trustees are Alfred University alumni.
Student media include: AU TV, the Kanakadea Yearbook, and WALF 89.7FM.), <a>Phi Kappa Phi</a>, and <a>Alpha Lambda Delta</a>; Alfred also has chapters of the service societies <a>Alpha Phi Omega</a> and <a>Omicron Delta Kappa</a>.
Other honor societies include <a>Alpha Iota Delta</a>, <a>Beta Gamma Sigma</a>, <a>Delta Mu Delta</a>, <a>Omicron Delta Epsilon</a>, <a>Pi Gamma Mu</a>, <a>Pi Mu Epsilon</a> (the Alpha Iota chapter of New York, chartered in 2002), <a>Pi Sigma Alpha</a>, <a>Sigma Tau Delta</a>, <a>Tau Beta Pi</a>, <a>Phi Alpha Theta</a>, <a>Phi Sigma Iota</a>, <a>Psi Chi</a>, Keramos, and the <a>Financial Management Association</a>.</p>
<h3>Athletics</h3>
<p>The teams have the nickname &quot;Saxons.&quot;
They compete in:Alpine Skiing, Basketball, Cross Country, men's Football, Lacrosse, Soccer, Swimming and Diving, Tennis, and Track and Field, women's volleyball and women's softball.
Alfred also has an extensive co-educational equestrian program.</p>
