<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>bum|left|200px|Fran&#x00e7;ois de Laval</a> The origins of the university are the S&#x00e9;minaire de Qu&#x00e9;bec founded in <a>1663</a> by <a>Fran&#x00e7;ois de Laval</a>, the first bishop of <a>New France</a>.
The S&#x00e9;minaire de Qu&#x00e9;bec was granted a Royal Charter on December 8, 1852, by <a>Queen Victoria</a>, creating Universit&#x00e9; Laval with 'the rights and privileges of a university'.</p>
<p><a>Bishop Bourget</a> of Montreal suggested interesting the S&#x00e9;minaire de Qu&#x00e9;bec in the establishment of Universit&#x00e9; Laval.
The Principal, M. Louis Casault, visited Europe to obtain a Royal charter, and studied the best university systems.
The charter was signed in 1852.
Pope Benedict XV approved the scheme, and authorized the erection of chairs of theology and the conferring of degrees.<a>thumb|right|220px|The
Old S&#x00e9;minaire de Qu&#x00e9;bec today</a></p>
<p>In 1878, the university opened a second campus in <a>Montreal</a>, which later became the <a>Universit&#x00e9; de Montr&#x00e9;al</a> on May 8, 1919, by a writ of Pope Benedict XV.
In 1971, a second charter vesting supreme authority in the Universit&#x00e9; Laval council was proclaimed.</p>
<p>While the main campus moved out from the S&#x00e9;minaire de Qu&#x00e9;bec since then, the architecture school returned to that heritage building (now affectionately referred to as <em>Le Vieux S&#x00e9;minaire</em>) in 1989.

<p>The governance structure at Laval incorporates the powers of board and senate.
The governance was modelled on the provincial University of Toronto Act of 1906 which established a bicameral system of university government consisting of a senate (faculty), responsible for academic policy, and a board of governors (citizens) exercising exclusive control over financial policy and having formal authority in all other matters.
The president, appointed by the board, was to provide a link between the 2 bodies and to perform institutional leadership.</p>
<h2>Buildings and features</h2>
<p>Universit&#x00e9; Laval's main campus covers 1.2&nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and has over 30 buildings, all linked by 10&nbsp;km of underground walkways, which are frequently used, particularly in the winter, when temperatures drop below the freezing point.
Of the campus lands, 56 per cent are wooded areas, grasslands, and sports fields.
The campus is home to the <a>Roger-Van den Hende</a> <a>botanical garden</a> and a plethora of different <a>flora</a> and <a>fauna</a>, including some 67 species of deciduous and coniferous trees and 60 different species of birds.</p>
<h2>Programmes</h2>
<p>As of 2002, Universit&#x00e9; Laval offers over 350 programmes to more than 38,000 students, 20 per cent of whom are studying at the postgraduate level.
The university also attracts more than 2,500 foreign students annually, and has close to 1,000 students from Canada.
Many students are also drawn to the university by the <em>Fran&#x00e7;ais pour non-francophones</em> programme that offers instruction in French as a second language to students from Canada and around the world.
It is also the only university in Quebec which trains forestry engineers.
From the mid-80s, Universit&#x00e9; Laval also offers distance learning.
