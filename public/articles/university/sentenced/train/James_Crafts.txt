<p> <strong>James Mason Crafts</strong> (March 8, 1839 &ndash; June 20, 1917) was an <a>American</a> <a>chemist</a>, best known for developing the <a>Friedel-Crafts</a> alkylation and acylation reactions with <a>Charles Friedel</a> in 1876.
</p>
<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>James Crafts was born in <a>Boston, Massachusetts</a> and graduated from <a>Harvard University</a> in 1858.
Although he never received his <a>Ph.D.</a>, he studied <a>chemistry</a> in Germany at the <a>Academy of Mines</a> (1859) of <a>Freiberg</a>, and served as an assistant to <a>Robert Bunsen</a> at <a>Heidelberg</a>, and then with [[Charles&#45;Adolphe Wurtz|Wurtz]] in <a>Paris</a> (1861).
</p>
<p>It was in Paris that Crafts first met <a>Charles Friedel</a>, with whom he later carried out some of his most successful research.
Crafts returned to the <a>United States</a> in 1865.
In 1868, he was appointed as the first <a>professor</a> of chemistry at the newly founded <a>Cornell University</a> in <a>Ithaca, New York</a>, where he remained until 1870.
</p>
<p>During the following four years Crafts served as professor of chemistry at the <a>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>, but in 1874 took a <a>leave of absence</a>, joined <a>Friedel</a> in <a>Paris</a>, and devoted himself exclusively to scientific research.
Upon his second return to the United States, in 1891, Crafts became professor of organic chemistry at the <a>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> (1892-97), where he also served as president from 1898 to 1900.
In 1900, Crafts resigned the presidency, and again turned to the investigation of problems in organic and physical chemistry.</p>
<h2>Scientific work</h2>
<p>Craft's investigations were largely in the field of <a>organic chemistry</a>, but his name is connected also with many interesting achievements in <a>physics</a> and in <a>physical chemistry</a>.
He invented a new <a>hydrogen</a> <a>thermometer</a>; measured the <a>densities</a> of <a>iodine</a> at very high temperatures; demonstrated an interesting regularity in the variation of the <a>boiling point</a>s of chemically allied <a>substances</a> with the external pressure; prepared a number of new <a>compound</a>s of the <a>element</a> <a>silicon</a>, which are interesting because of their chemical resemblance to the corresponding compounds of <a>carbon</a>; and also prepared new compounds of <a>arsenic</a>.
But his most important achievement was the discovery, jointly with Friedel, of one of the most fruitful <a>synthetic method</a>s in organic chemistry.
</p>
<p>Hundreds of new <a>carbon compound</a>s have been brought into existence by this method (<a>New International Encyclopedia</a>), which is based on the <a>catalytic action</a> of the <a>chloride</a> of <a>aluminium</a>.</p>
<h2>Recognition</h2>
<p>In recognition of Crafts's services to <a>science</a>, the <a>French government</a> made him a chevalier of the [[L&#233;gion d'honneur|Legion of Honor]] (1885), and the <a>British Association for the Advancement of Science</a> made him one of its corresponding members.
<a>Harvard University</a> conferred on him the honorary degree of <a>LL.D.</a> in 1898.</p>
<p>The Crafts entry at MIT's <a>Senior House</a> dormitory is named in his honor.</p>
