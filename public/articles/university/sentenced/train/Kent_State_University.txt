<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Early history</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|300px|Front of Kent Hall, built in 1915, one of the oldest buildings on campus.</a>
What would become Kent State University was established in 1910 as an institution for training public school teachers.
It was part of the <a>Lowry Bill</a> which also created a sister school in <a>Bowling Green, Ohio</a> &#x2013; now known as <a>Bowling Green State University</a>.
It was initially known under the working name of the <strong><a>Ohio State Normal College At Kent</a></strong>,&lt;ref&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; but was named <strong>Kent State Normal School</strong> in 1911 in honor of William S. Kent (son of <a>Kent, Ohio</a>, namesake <a>Marvin Kent</a>), who donated the  used for the original campus.
As such, it is the only public university in Ohio named for an individual.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The first president was <a>John Edward McGilvrey</a>, who served from 1912 to 1926.&lt;ref name=mcgilvrey&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; McGilvrey had an ambitious vision for the school as a large university, instructing architect <a>George F. Hammond</a>, who designed the original campus buildings, to produce a master plan.&lt;ref&gt;Treichler,
p. 1; <em>&quot;President McGilvery, always a visionary, harbored the prospect that Kent would one day become a great university, and he instructed <a>George Hammond</a> to generate an architectural master plan to reflect that goal.&quot;</em>&lt;/ref&gt;
Classes began in 1912 before any buildings had been completed at the campus in Kent.
These classes were held at extension centers in 25 cities around the region.
By May 1913, classes were being held on the campus in Kent with the opening of Merrill Hall.&lt;ref
name=memories1&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The school graduated 34 students in its first commencement on July 29, 1914.
In 1915, the school was renamed <strong>Kent State Normal College</strong>&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; due to the addition of four-year degrees.
By then additional buildings had been added or were under construction.
Kent State's enrollment growth was particularly notable during its summer terms.
In 1924, the school's registration for summer classes was the largest of any teacher-training school in the United States.&lt;ref
name=memories1/&gt;  In 1929, the state of Ohio changed the name to <strong>Kent State College</strong> as it allowed the school to establish a college of arts and sciences.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>McGilvrey's vision for Kent was not shared by many others outside the school, particularly at the state level and at other state schools.
His efforts to have the state funding formula changed created opposition, particularly from <a>Ohio State University</a> and its president <a>William Oxley Thompson</a>.
This resulted in a 1923 &quot;credit war&quot; where Ohio State refused Kent transfer credits and spread to several other schools taking similar action.
It was this development &#x2013; along with several other factors &#x2013; which led to the firing of McGilvrey in January 1926.&lt;ref
name=memories1/&gt;  McGilvrey was succeeded first by David Allen Anderson (1926&#x2013;1928) and James Ozro Engleman from 1928&#x2013;1938, though he continued to be involved with the school for several years as president emeritus and as head of alumni relations from 1934-1945.&lt;ref
name=mcgilvrey/&gt;  He was present in <a>Columbus</a> on May 17, 1935, when <a>Kent</a> native Governor <a>Martin L. Davey</a> signed a bill that allowed Kent State and <a>Bowling Green</a> to add schools of business administration and graduate programs, giving them each university status.&lt;ref
name=memories1/&gt;</p>
<h3>1940s-1960s</h3>
<p>Beginning in 1944, the University was led by President George Bowman, who lead until 1963.
During his tenure, the student senate, faculty senate and graduate council were organized.
Although it had served Stark County from the 1920s, in 1946, the University's first regional campus, the <a>Stark Campus</a>, was established in <a>Canton, Ohio</a>.
In the fall of 1947, Bowman appointed <a>Oscar W. Ritchie</a> as a full-time faculty member.
Ritchie's appointment to the faculty made him the first <a>African American</a> to serve on the faculty at Kent State and also made him the first African American professor to serve on the faculty of any state university in Ohio.
In 1977, the former Student Union, which had been built in 1949, was rededicated as Oscar Ritchie Hall in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Recently renovated, Oscar Ritchie Hall currently houses the department of <a>Pan-African Studies</a> and the Pan-African Cultural Center.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The 1950s and 1960s saw continued growth in both enrollment and in the physical size of the campus.
Several new dorms and academic buildings were built during this time, including the establishment of additional regional campuses in <a>Warren</a> (1954), <a>Ashtabula</a> (1957), <a>New Philadelphia</a> (1962), <a>Salem</a> (1962), <a>Burton</a> (1964), and <a>East Liverpool</a>, <a>Ohio</a> (1965).&lt;ref&gt;Hildebrand,
Herrington, &amp; Keller; pp.
267-270&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, grounds superintendent Larry Wooddell and Biff Staples of the <a>Davey Tree Expert Company</a> released ten cages of <a>black squirrel</a>s obtained from <a>Victoria Park</a> in <a>London, Ontario</a>, <a>Canada</a>, onto the Kent State campus.
By 1964 their estimated population was around 150 and today they have spread in and around Kent and have become unofficial mascots of both the city and university.
Since 1981, the annual Black Squirrel Festival is held every fall on campus.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hildebrand,
Herrington, &amp; Keller; p. 258&lt;/ref&gt; </p>
<p>In 1965, chemistry professor Glenn H. Brown established the <a>Liquid Crystal Institute</a>,&lt;ref name=KHS&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; a world leader in the research and development the multibillion-dollar <a>liquid crystal</a> industry.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
James Fergasen invented and patented the basic liquid crystal in the 1970s&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and ten liquid crystal companies have been spun off from the Institute.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>In 1967, Kent State became the first university to run an independent, student-operated Campus Bus Service.
It was unique in that it provided jobs for students, receiving funding from student fees rather than bus fares.
Campus Bus Service was the largest such operation in the country until it merged with the <a>Portage Area Regional Transportation Authority</a> in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
1969 saw the opening of a <a>new Memorial Stadium</a> on the far eastern edge of campus and the closure and dismantling of the <a>old Memorial Stadium</a>.
<a>thumb|left|300px|Main May 4th Memorial</a></p>
<h3>Kent State shootings</h3>
<p> Kent State gained international attention on May 4, 1970, when an <a>Ohio Army National Guard</a> unit fired at students during an anti-war protest on campus, killing four and wounding nine.
The Guard had been called into Kent after several protests in and around campus had become violent, including a riot in downtown Kent and the burning of the <a>ROTC</a> building.
The main cause of the protests was the United States' <a>invasion of Cambodia</a> during the <a>Vietnam War</a>.&lt;ref&gt;Hildebrand,
Herrington, &amp; Keller; pp.
165-166&lt;/ref&gt;  The shootings caused an immediate closure of the campus with students and faculty given just 60&nbsp;minutes to pack belongings.
Around the country, many college campuses canceled classes or closed for fear of similar violent protests.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
In Kent, schools were closed and the National Guard restricted entry into the city limits, patrolling the area until May 8.
With the campus closed, faculty members came up with a variety of solutions &#x2014; including holding classes in their homes, at public buildings and places, via telephone, or through the mail &#x2014; to allow their students to complete the term, which was only a few weeks away at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Hildebrand,
Herrington, &amp; Keller; pp.
181-183&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1971, the University established the Center for Peaceful Change, now known as the Center for Applied Conflict Management, as a &quot;living memorial&quot; to the students who had died.
It offers degree programs in Peace and Conflict Studies&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and Conflict Resolution and is one of the earliest such programs in the United States.</p>
<h3>1970s-1980s</h3>
<p>Also in 1970, the university opened its 12-story library, moving from the previous home of Rockwell Hall to the tallest building in <a>Portage County</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Dedicated in 1971, the library became a member of the <a>Association of Research Libraries</a> in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Hildebrand,
Herrington, &amp; Keller; p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;  Kent State joined with the <a>University of Akron</a> and <a>Youngstown State University</a> in establishing the <a>Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine</a> in 1973.
It was the world's first medical consortium.&lt;ref&gt;Darrow,
p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;  Today it includes a college of <a>pharmacy</a> and <a>Cleveland State University</a> as an additional consortium member.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
</p>
<p>Kent State was again in the national spotlight in 1977 when construction was set to begin on the Memorial Gym Annex, adjacent to the area where the <a>Kent State shootings</a> had occurred in 1970.
Protesters organized a <a>tent city</a> in May, which lasted into July.
Several attempts were made to block construction even after the end of the tent city, including an appeal to the <a>United States Congress</a> and the <a>Department of the Interior</a> to have the area declared a <a>National Historic Landmark</a>, which ended up being unsuccessful.
Additional rallies were held that year, including one attended by <a>Joan Baez</a> on August 20.
After several additional unsuccessful legal challenges, construction finally began on September 19 and was finished in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>1990s-Present</h3>
<p>In March 1991, Kent State once again made history by appointing <a>Carol Cartwright</a> as president of the University, the first female to hold such a position at any state university in Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1994, Kent State was named a &quot;Research University II&quot; by the Carnegie Foundation.
Today it is classified as a <a>Doctoral/Research University-Extensive</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Beginning in the late 1990s, the University began a series of building renovations and construction, which included the complete renovation of the historic original campus,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the construction of several new dormitories, a student recreation center, and additional academic buildings on the Kent Campus and at the regional campuses.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
In September 2010, the university announced its largest student body ever, with a total enrollment of 41,365.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
