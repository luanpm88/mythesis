<p></p>
<p><strong>Western Michigan University</strong> (<strong>WMU</strong>) is a <a>public university</a> established in 1903 by <a>Dwight B. Waldo</a>.
When the school first opened, it was known as the <strong>Western State Normal School</strong>, but was renamed <strong>Western State Teachers College</strong> in 1927 and <strong>Western Michigan College of Education</strong> in 1941.
On February 26, 1957 Governor <a>G.
Mennen Williams</a> signed into law a bill making <strong>Western Michigan College</strong> the state's fourth public university.
In its annual ranking of the nation&#x2019;s 4,000 colleges and universities, <a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a> consistently lists WMU as one of the nation&#x2019;s top 100 public universities.</p>
<p>WMU's main <a>campus</a> is located in <a>Kalamazoo, Michigan</a>, USA.
As of the Fall 2009 semester, the school has an enrollment of 24,576.
The school's <a>mascot</a> is <a>Buster Bronco</a>, and the <a>school colors</a> are <a>brown</a> and <a>gold</a>.</p>
<p>WMU's College of Aviation is one of the largest <a>aviation</a> programs in the <a>United States</a>; the university is also noted for its Paper Engineering and Behavior Analysis programs, as well as for the Haworth College of Business and Army <a>ROTC</a> program.

<p>The <a>College of Aviation</a> offers the best education in aviation at a public university in Michigan, and with over 900 undergraduate students, it offers one of the largest (top 3) Flight Science programs in the nation.
Backed by over 60 years of history and a strong industry reputation, the College of Aviation is a powerful force in the cutting edge aviation training.</p>
<p>College of Aviation provides 3 program options for students.</p>
<p><strong> <a>Aviation Flight Science</a></strong></p>
<p>The Aviation Flight Science program emphasizes intellectual as well as technical competencies.
The program is geared toward educating future captains and managers&#x2014;not just training pilots.
In the program, students study general education subjects, the basic sciences, aircraft systems, crew concepts, and resource management, advanced aerodynamics, professional flight, airline operations, management and administration, global navigation, and international flight.
If students wish, they will also have an opportunity to be involved in faculty research projects geared toward moving the industry forward.</p>
<p>The program also features crew concept in the flight training environment, Crew Resource Management (CRM), the use of state-of-the-art simulators and Line Oriented Flight Crew Simulations, computer based training, and the most advanced flight training equipment with glass cockpit technology including Electronic Flight Information Systems (EFIS) and Flight Management Systems (FMS).</p>
<p>In the 1990s, the College of Aviation revised its curriculum to more effectively train students with no previous flight training and to focus on what the airline industry and aviation regulators regard as the critical components of aviation education.
Through this revised curriculum students move from zero flight experience, to degree completion, to employment readiness.
Once hired, the only further training required will be for conversion to operating with a specific airline on a specific aircraft.
College of Aviation strives to remain in touch with the changing needs of the aviation industry so students can get the training and education they need to be a functional and productive part of it.</p>
<p><strong> <a>Aviation Maintenance Technology</a> </strong> </p>
<p>The Aviation Maintenance Technology (AMT) program is a Bachelor of Science program that prepares students to enter technical positions in the aerospace industry.
The curriculum focuses on aircraft structures and system design, operation, test, and inspection.
These skills and knowledge coupled with a solid science foundation prepares the students for employment in a wide range of aircraft maintenance, manufacturing, and aviation support careers.
The Bachelor of Science degree positions our graduates for technology leadership roles in the future.
</p>
<p>The AMT program offers course work in advanced industry standards and practices including non-destructive test, composite construction and repair, avionics, and design for reliability and maintainability.
In addition, students who complete the program qualify to take the examinations for the FAA Aviation Maintenance Technician certification with airframe and powerplant ratings which is recognized around the world as the standard of aviation technical knowledge.</p>
<p>WMU AMT graduates are highly regarded and sought after by industry.
After graduation they go on to positions with airlines, corporate flight operations, manufacturers, government agencies, third party maintenance organizations, and fixed base operators.
Air carriers and maintenance organizations routinely recruit WMU graduates.
Many seniors have internships with local aircraft repair organizations, corporate flight operations and in WMU flight department's maintenance facility which in many cases turns into full time employment upon graduation.</p>
<p>The WMU AMT program is the premiere aviation technology program in the country and will prepare students for a challenging career in aerospace.</p>
<p><strong><a>Aviation Administration</a></strong></p>
<p>The Aviation Science and Administration program will increase students awareness of options and opportunities in the airline industry while helping them prepare for a variety of positions and careers, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Airline Administration and Management</li>
  <li>General Aviation Administration and Management</li>
  <li>Airport Management and Operations</li>
  <li>Technical Support within the Aviation Industry</li>
  <li>Technical Sales or Service</li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from the general education that students will gain, the program concentrates on aviation related management subjects as well as business related groundwork including economics, finance, accountancy, and business enterprise.
There are also several electives available to allow them to concentrate on specific areas of management such as organizational behavior, entrepreneurship, airline strategy, or multinational management.
Future plans include the addition of state-of-the-art simulations of airport and airline management, planning and preparation for which will begin in Spring 2008.</p>
<p>Aviation Science and Administration program graduates are regularly hired to work for major airlines, airports and support industries such as United Airlines, O'Hare Airport in Chicago, Detroit Metro Airport and B.F. Goodrich Aerospace.
</p>
<p><strong>Vision.</strong>
<strong></strong> The College of Aviation's vision is to establish and maintain state-of-the-art, world-class professional aviation programs that are among the best in the world.
The COA is examining various methods of teaching and pioneering revolutionary new methods of instruction designed to improve students leadership skills in the aviation industry.
The COA strives to produce graduates who think critically, communicate effectively, and participate meaningfully and ethically in the dynamic field of aviation.</p>
<p><strong>College facilities</strong> The College of Aviation's ability to deliver this comprehensive education is enhanced by its state-of-the-art Cirrus SR-20 fleet and turbine engine testing sites.
Facility is located in <a>Battle Creek, Michigan</a> at WK Kellogg Field</p>
<p><strong>New Runway</strong> Because the demand for training is so high, the city of Battle Creek and the Air National Guard in conjunction with the CoA, have decided to construct a new runway for use mostly by the CoA students.
The new runway will be just to the west of the current runway 23 and will run parallel to it.
This will, when the project is finished, cause Battle Creek's main runway to be renamed runway 23L and the new runway 23R.
The total cost of the project is around $7 million, 95% money coming from the government.
It is scheduled to be completed in the fall of 2010 </p>
