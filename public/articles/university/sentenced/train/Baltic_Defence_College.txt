<p> The <strong>Baltic Defence College</strong> (official acronym BALTDEFCOL, commonly also BDCOL) is a multi-lateral co-operative military college which educates officers from not only the three Baltic States (<a>Estonia</a>, <a>Latvia</a> and <a>Lithuania</a>), but also from <a>NATO</a> and <a>EU</a> States and other European States as <a>Ukraine</a>, <a>Moldova</a>, <a>Bosnia and Herzegovina</a>, <a>Georgia</a> and <a>Romania</a>.</p>

The core activity of BALTDEFCOL is the Joint Command and General Staff Course (JCGSC).
It is in most aspects similar to other one-year Joint Command and General Staff courses.
Since 2004, BALTDEFCOL has established the Higher Command Studies Course (HCSC), which is an officer education level four course.
The Civil Servants Course (CSC) is also run to prepare civil servants for national security and defence policy work.</p>
<p>The first Commandant of the BALTDEFCOL, the Danish <a>Brigadier General</a> M. H. Clemmesen (<a>Danish Army</a>), retired from his position in December 2004.
The post is now being rotated between the three Baltic states.
