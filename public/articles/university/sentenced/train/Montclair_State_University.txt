<p><strong>Montclair State University</strong> is a public research university located in the <a>Upper Montclair</a> section of <a>Montclair</a>, the <a>Great Notch</a> area of <a>Little Falls</a>, and <a>Clifton</a>, <a>New Jersey</a>.
As of October 2009, there were 18,171 total enrolled students: 14,139 undergraduate students and 4,032 graduate students.
Montclair State University is New Jersey's second largest school,  More than 250 majors, minors and concentrations are offered.</p>
<p>Along with <a>NJIT</a> and <a>Rutgers University</a>, it offers opportunities to pursue a <a>Phd</a> in <a>biomedicine</a> with its joint degree program with <a>UMDNJ</a>.
The university also offers articulation agreements with <a>UMDNJ</a>'s <a>Medical</a>, <a>Dental</a> including the American Association of State Colleges and Universities,</p>
<p>In <a>2009</a>, <a>Forbes Magazine</a> awarded the University &quot;Best <a>Public University</a> in <a>New Jersey</a>&quot; and third best <a>University</a> overall in the state.
amongst <a>Princeton</a>, <a>Rutgers</a>, <a>Stevens Institute of Technology</a> and <a>NJIT</a>.
which directly links the university to <a>New York City</a>.
and it took a year for permission to be granted for the approval of the state for building the school.
It was then established as <strong>New Jersey State Normal School at Montclair</strong>, a <a>normal school</a>, in 1908 approximately 5 years after the initial planning of the school.
At the time, Governor <a>John Franklin Fort</a> attended the dedication of the school in 1908, and the school was to have its first principal Charles Sumner Chapin that same year.
The first building constructed was College Hall, and it still stands today.
At the time however, the school only offered two year programs which were meant to train and develop school teachers.
At the time, the campus was around , had 8 faculty members and 187 students.
The first graduating class, which numbered at 45 students, contained William O. Trapp, who would then go on to win the <a>Pulitzer Prize</a> for journalism in 1929.
The first dormitories were then built five years later, in 1915, and is known as Russ Hall.</p>
<p>In 1924, Dr. Harry Sprague was to become the first president of Montclair, and shortly afterwards the school began being more inclusive of extracurricular activities such as sports, which are still an important sect in the culture of the school.
In 1927 however, after studies had emerged  concerning the number of high school teachers in the state of <a>New Jersey</a> (only 10% of all high school teachers received their degrees from New Jersey), the institution became <strong>Montclair State Teachers College</strong> and developed a four-year (Bachelors of Arts) program in <a>pedagogy</a>, becoming the first US institute to do so.
In 1937 it became the first teachers college accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools.</p>
<p>In 1943, during <a>World War II</a>, several students, under permission from the president, Harry Sprague, had joined the <a>US Navy</a> as volunteers, to train for the war.
It was also a time when students and faculty would sell <a>war bonds</a> to support US American troops.</p>
<p>Then in 1958, the school fused itself with the <strong>Panzer College of Physical Education and Hygiene</strong> to become <strong>Montclair State College</strong>.
The school became a comprehensive multi-purpose institution in 1966.
On the list of Americas best Public Colleges, Montclair State came in at 54th best public institution in the United States.
Also, the university was also added as a &quot;Best Buy&quot; university compiled by CCAP and Forbes, placing the University at #15 on the 25 Best Buy Northeastern Colleges list.</p>
<h2>Colleges and Schools</h2>
<p>Montclair State University contains six colleges and/or schools, each with its own Dean.
For the most part these schools organize and conduct academic programs individually (i.e.
Bachelor's Degree Programs, Master's Degree Programs, Certificate Programs, etc.), but occasionally work cooperatively to offer interdisciplinary programs.
For example, a student may pursue a degree in Psychology with Teacher Certification in Social Studies - a program that is offered jointly by the College of Humanities and Social Sciences (Psychology) and the College of Education and Human Services (Teacher Certification).</p>
<h3>The College of Education and Human Services (CEHS)</h3>
<p>The College of Education and Human Services also houses the Teacher Education program.
Majors in other colleges with a teacher certification component are administered jointly by the Teacher Education program and the college or school responsible for the major's subject matter.
In addition, the noted string quartet, the <a>Shanghai Quartet</a>, has been in residence at MSU since 2002.</p>

<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p><a>right|thumb|250px|Montclair State Red Hawk's logo, introduced in Jan. 2005</a></p>
<p>Montclair State University's athletic teams have played under many names in the school's history.
From the late 1920s-30s, the school played as the &quot;Big Red,&quot; and featured a large scarlet &quot;M&quot; on its uniforms.
Next, Montclair State Teacher&#x2019;s College competed as the Indians, using a logo with a <a>Native American</a> chief's profile with the initials &quot;MSTC&quot; emblazoned on the caricature's headdress.
The initials were changed to &quot;MSC&quot; when the school became Montclair State College in 1958.
At one point in the 1980s, the school's baseball team used the cartoon Native American used by the <a>Cleveland Indians</a>.
Finally, in 1989, in response to the growing concerns voiced by many Native Americans, the school changed its nickname to the Red Hawks, named after the <a>Red-tailed Hawk</a>s that are indigenous to the area.</p>

<h2>Growth of Montclair State University</h2>
<p>The old campus of Montclair State consisted of College Hall, Russ Hall, Chapin Hall and Morehead Hall, all built between 1908 and 1928.
Near the end of World War II, housing for returning soldiers was added; one of these buildings still stands today and houses the broadcasting department.
Between 1950 and 1980, Montclair acquired a significant amount of land in Little Falls that had previously been a rock quarry, and added at least 23 buildings to its campus during that time.</p>
<p>Additions to the campus slowed after this, with the dormitory Blanton Hall  the only major addition to campus before Montclair State began aggressively pushing growth again in the late 1990s.</p>
<p>Dickson Hall was dedicated to David W.D Dickson, the first African American president of Montclair State, in 1995.
The <a>Floyd Hall</a> Arena, an ice skating rink, was built in 1998.
In 1999, Science Hall was opened.
In 2001, the Red Hawk Diner was added to the campus, making it the first diner on a university campus in the United States.</p>
<h3>Recent Additions (2002-2010)</h3>
<p>In recent years, MSU committed itself to a $250 million capital construction program [<a>http://www.montclair.edu/welcome/intro.html</a>].
Some major projects achieved under this program are:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h3>New Capital Master Plan (2010-2014)</h3>
<p>MSU has once again committed itself to a new campus master plan, estimated at about $650 million in capital construction and improvements [<a>http://www.montclair.edu/facilities/Capital_Master_Plan.pdf</a>].
The major projects under this new program are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A  building, located adjacent to University Hall, to house the new <strong>School of Business</strong>, scheduled to open in Fall of 2012.</li>
<li>A  new building, located adjacent to Richardson Hall, to house the new <strong>Center for Environmental and Life Sciences</strong>, scheduled to open in Fall of 2013.
It will contain expanded research labs, and will house interdisciplinary programs in Chemistry, Chemical Biology, Pharmaceutical Sciences, and probably the Doctoral Program in Environmental Management.</li>
  <li>A  expansion of Morehead Hall, will form the <strong>Communication and Media Studies Center</strong>, which is scheduled to open in 2014.</li>
<li>A  building, located across from the Red Hawk Parking Deck, will house the <strong>Visual Arts and Design Center</strong>, replacing Calcia Hall (which will be torn down).
The new facility is scheduled to open in 2014.</li>
<li>Two new student housing and dining complexes, the <strong>Hillside and Rec Center Residence Halls</strong>, are currently under construction, adjacent to the Student Recreation Center and CarParc Diem Garage.
They will house more than 2,000 students, increasing the on-campus housing capacity to 5,500, the second largest college residential population in New Jersey.
They will also increase dining capacity by 25,000 gross square feet, and are scheduled to open in time for the 2011-2012 academic year.</li>
<li>Various expansions, improvements and renovations of current residential buildings and athletic facilities, College Hall, Richardson Hall, Science Hall, Partridge Hall (current home of SBUS), Mallory Hall, Life Hall, the Bond House, Student Center, and the <strong>New Jersey School of Conservation</strong> (240 acre campus, the site of major environmental education and research facilities in Stokes state forest, Sussex County) are all planned for this period as well.</li>
<li>Upgrades to the entire campus physical plant, maintenance (i.e. a new facility on the north side of campus), heat and power generation (i.e. a new and improved facility near Floyd Hall arena), public safety (i.e. a new <strong>Public Safety building</strong>), roads and traffic, surface parking, etc., are all scheduled projects in this capital master plan.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Parking</h3>
<p>Increased enrollment along with new construction and limited expansion options have caused a parking crunch at Montclair State University.
The school has responded to the parking demands by constructing three garages:  The Red Hawk Deck, the NJ Transit Deck (located at the Montclair State University NJ Transit train station), and a third parking garage was recently built and opened, the CarParc Diem deck.</p>
