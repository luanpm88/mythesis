<h3>National Center for Bioethics in Research and Health Care</h3>
<p>National Center for Bioethics in Research and Health Care is the nation's first bioethics center devoted to engaging the sciences, humanities, law and religious faiths in the exploration of the core moral issues which underlie research and medical treatment of African Americans and other underserved people.
The official launching of the Center took place two years after President <a>Bill Clinton</a>'s apology to the nation, the survivors of the <a>Syphilis Study</a>, Tuskegee University, and Tuskegee/<a>Macon County, Alabama</a> for the U.S. Public Health Service medical experiment (1932&#x2013;1972), where 399 poor&#x2014;and mostly illiterate&#x2014;African American sharecroppers became part of a study on the treatment and natural history of syphilis.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Planning and establishment</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|History class at Tuskegee, 1902</a> The school was the dream of <a>Lewis Adams</a>, a former enslaved African American, and George W. Campbell, a former slave owner.
Adams could read, write and speak several languages despite having no formal education.
He also was an experienced <a>tinsmith</a>, harness-maker and <a>shoemaker</a> and <a>Prince Hall Freemason</a>, an acknowledged leader of the <a>African-American</a> community in <a>Macon County, Alabama</a>.
</p>
<p>During <a>Reconstruction</a>, the period following the <a>American Civil War</a>, the South was impoverished.
Many <a>blacks</a> were illiterate and had few employable job skills.
Adams was especially concerned that, without an education, the recently <a>freed former slaves</a> would not be able to support themselves.
Campbell, of like-thinking, had become a merchant and a banker.
He had little experience with educational institutions, but he was willing to contribute all of his resources and efforts to make the school a success.
</p>
<p>W.F.
Foster, a white candidate for the Alabama Senate, came to Adams with a question.
What would Adams want in return for securing the votes of African Americans in Macon County for Foster and another white candidate?
In response, Adams asked for a <a>normal school</a> for the free men, freed slaves and their children (a <em>normal school</em>, at that time, was the name for a teacher's college) to be established in the area.
</p>
<p>Foster and the other candidate were elected.
He worked with the fellow legislator Arthur L. Brooks to draft and pass legislation authorizing $2,000 to create the school.
Adams, Thomas Dyer, and M.B.
Swanson formed Tuskegee's first board of commissioners.
They wrote to <a>Hampton Institute</a> in Virginia, asking the school to recommend someone to head their new school.
Former Union Army General and Hampton Principal <a>Samuel C. Armstrong</a> felt that he knew just the man for the job: 25 year-old <a>Booker T. Washington</a>.</p>
<h3>Booker T. Washington's leadership</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Washington was a former enslaved African American who, after working menial labor jobs as a <a>freedman</a>, had sought a formal education and worked his way through Hampton Institute and had graduated from <a>Wayland Seminary</a> in <a>Washington, D.C.</a> (now, <a>Virginia Union University</a>).
He had returned to Hampton, where he was working as a teacher.
Sam Armstrong, who knew him well, strongly recommended him to Tuskegee's founders in Alabama.
</p>
<p>Lewis Adams and Tuskegee's governing body agreed, and hired Washington, although such positions had always been held by whites.
Under his leadership, the new  <a>normal school</a> (for the training of teachers) opened on July 4, 1881 in space borrowed from a church.
The following year, Washington bought the grounds of a former <a>plantation</a>, where the campus is still located.
The buildings were constructed by students, many of whom earned all or part of their expenses through construction, agricultural, and domestic work.
The school was a living example of Washington's dedication to the pursuit of self-reliance.
In addition to training teachers, one of his great concerns was to teach the practical skills needed to succeed at farming or other trades.
This was done in order to teach his students to see labor not only as practical, but also as beautiful and dignified.
One of Tuskegee's most noteworthy professors was <a>George Washington Carver</a>, who was recruited by Washington.
[[File:Booker T. Washington residence - The Oaks.jpg|thumb|left|The Oaks, [[Booker T. Washington]]'s home on the Tuskegee campus, circa 1906]] In addition to building Tuskegee, Washington became a famous orator and leading spokesperson for African Americans in the United States for the final 20 years of his life.
He was awarded honorary degrees, including a doctorate.
Later Washington was perceived as accommodating, for emphasizing industrial arts as the priority in black education.
At the same time, however, he used his wealthy patrons to secretly fund and arrange legal representation for blacks in litigation over disfranchising provisions of state constitutions.
He helped bring forward such cases as <em><a>Giles v. Harris</a></em> (1903) and <em><a>Giles v. Teasley</a></em> (1904).
</p>
<p>Dr.
Washington used Tuskegee to develop a network of wealthy American <a>philanthropist</a>s such as <a>Andrew Carnegie</a>, <a>Collis P. Huntington</a>, <a>John D. Rockefeller</a>, <a>Henry Huttleston Rogers</a> and <a>Elizabeth Milbank Anderson</a>.
According to Dr. Washington's papers, Rogers, who had a poor public image as a <a>robber baron</a> and a leader of <a>Standard Oil</a>, was actually warm and generous with his friends, family and what he felt were worthy causes.
An early champion of the concept of <a>matching funds</a>, Henry Rogers was a major anonymous contributor to Tuskegee and dozens of other black schools for more than 15 years.
In June 1909, Dr. Washington made a famous speaking tour along the newly completed <a>Virginian Railway</a> in Rogers' personal railcar <em>Dixie,</em> stopping at rural points in southern <a>Virginia</a> and southern <a>West Virginia</a> where the railroad was providing a new transportation link for commerce.
His traveling companion on the tour recorded that Dr. Washington was warmly received by blacks and whites alike.
</p>
<p><a>thumb|1940 photo, Junior class in farm management at Tuskegee Institute.</a>Another
major relationship Washington developed was with <a>Julius Rosenwald</a>, son of an immigrant <a>Jewish</a> clothier and self-made man who had risen to the top of <a>Sears, Roebuck and Company</a> in <a>Chicago, Illinois</a>.
He and other Jewish friends had long been concerned about the lack of educational resources for blacks, especially in the South.
After meeting with Dr. Washington, Rosenwald agreed to serve on Tuskegee's Board of Directors.
He also worked with Dr. Washington to stimulate funding to train teachers schools such as Tuskegee and Hampton Institute.
Beginning with a pilot program in 1912, he created model schools and stimulated construction of new schools.
He used  technical help from Tuskegee to develop plans and build schools.
Rosenwald created a fund but required communities to raise matching funds to encourage local collaboration.
Rosenwald and Washington stimulated the construction and operation of more than 5,000 small community schools and supporting resources for the education of blacks throughout the rural <a>the South</a> in the early 20th century.
The local schools were a source of much community pride and were of priceless value to African-American families during those troubled times in public education.
This work was a major part of Dr. Washington's legacy and was continued (and expanded through the <a>Rosenwald Fund</a> and others) for many years after his death.
</p>
<p>Despite his travels and widespread work, Dr. Washington continued as principal of Tuskegee.
Concerned about the educator's health, Rosenwald took steps to ease his tireless pace.
However, in 1915, Washington died at the age of 59, as a result of <a>congestive heart failure</a>, reportedly aggravated by overwork.
At his death, Tuskegee's endowment exceeded US$1.5 million.
He was buried on the campus near the chapel.</p>
<p>In 1922, Reol Productions, owned by race film producer <a>Robert Levy</a>, made a documentary titled <em>The Leader of His Race</em>.
The Tuskegee Institute approached the production company to tell the story of Washington, whose memory they revered.
Following this, Tuskegee commissioned a second documentary, choosing Levy again as the producer.
This film, <em>A Tuskegee Pilgrimage</em>, was a collection of interviews with faculty and students that could be used as a marketing tool.</p>
<h3>World War II and after</h3>
<p>In 1941, in an effort to train black <a>aviator</a>s, a training organization of the <a>U.S. Army Air Corps</a> was established at Tuskegee Institute, using <a>Moton Field</a>, about  away from the campus center.
These aviators became known as the <a>Tuskegee Airmen</a> and both the Army and Air Force R.O.T.C. programs still exist there today.
The <a>Tuskegee Airmen National Historic Site</a> at Moton Field was established in 1998.
<a>Robert Russa Moton</a> was the successor to Booker T. Washington after his death in 1915, and the second president of Tuskegee Institute.</p>
<p>In 1985, Tuskegee Institute achieved university status and was renamed Tuskegee University.
Eleanor Roosevelt was very interested in the work at the Tuskegee Institute, particularly in the aeronautical school.
In 1941 she visited Tuskegee Army Air Field and asked to take a flight with one of the Tuskegee pilots.
Although the Secret Service was anxious about the ride, flight instructor Charles A. Anderson piloted Mrs. Roosevelt over the skies of Alabama for over an hour.
That flight proved for Mrs. Roosevelt that blacks could fly airplanes and she did everything in her power to help them in that endeavor.
</p>
<p>Eleanor Roosevelt also corresponded with F.D. Patterson, the third  president of the Tuskegee Institute, and lent her support to the Institute whenever she was able to do so.
