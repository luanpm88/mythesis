Olaf ranks as one of the top 20 small colleges (those with 5,000 or fewer students) for the number of students who go on to serve in the <a>Peace Corps</a>.</p>
<p>St.
Olaf College is listed in <a>Loren Pope</a>'s <em><a>Colleges That Change Lives</a></em>.</p>

<h2>History of the college</h2>
<h3>Founding of the college</h3>
<p>[[File:HAPreus.JPG|thumb|[[Herman Amberg Preus]], (1825 &#x2013; 1894), a key figure in organizing the Norwegian Synod.]]
Many <a>Norwegian</a> immigrants arrived in <a>Rice County, Minnesota</a>, and the surrounding area in the late 19th century.
With nearly all the immigrants being <a>Lutheran</a> <a>Christians</a>, they desired a non-secular <a>post-secondary</a> institution in the Lutheran tradition that offered classes in all subjects in both <a>Norwegian</a> and <a>English</a>.
The catalyst for founding St. Olaf was the Reverend <a>Bernt Julius Muus</a>, and he sought out the help of the Rev. <a>N.A. Quammen</a> and H. Thorson.
Together they petitioned their parishes and others to raise money in order to buy a plot of land on which to build this new institution.
The three men succeeded in receiving around $10,000 in pledges, and thus went on to form a <a>corporation</a> and to buy a plot of land and four buildings (old <a>Northfield</a> schoolhouses) for accommodations for the school.</p>
<p>St.
Olaf, then called St. Olaf's School, opened on January 8, 1875 at its first site under the leadership of its first president, <a>Thorbjorn Mohn</a>, a graduate of <a>Luther College</a>.
<a>Herman Amberg Preus</a>, President of the <a>Norwegian Synod</a>, laid this foundation stone of the St. Olaf School on July 4, 1877.
During 1887 the <em>Manitou Messenger</em> was founded as a campus magazine and has since evolved into the college's student newspaper.</p>
<h2>Overview of the campus</h2>

<h2>Music at St. Olaf</h2>
<p>St.
Olaf's world-renowned music program was founded by <a>F.
Melius Christiansen</a> in 1903.
Its <a>band</a>, <a>choir</a> and orchestra tour the continental U.S. annually and have made many critically-acclaimed international tours (that occur every three years).
The <a>St.
Olaf Band</a>, currently under the direction of <a>Timothy Mahr '78</a>, was the first American college musical organization to conduct a concert tour abroad when it traveled to <a>Norway</a> in 1906.
A St. Olaf graduate, Dr. Mahr pushes the band to new levels at every possible opportunity.
In March 1997, the St. Olaf Band toured California for nine days.
They were one of four college or university bands invited to perform at the prestigious American Bandmasters Association National Convention in San Diego.</p>
<p>The <a>St.
Olaf Orchestra</a> is conducted by Steven Amundson.
Under Amundson&#x2019;s direction, the Orchestra has successfully performed demanding scores seldom attempted by amateur groups, including Mahler&#x2019;s Symphony No. 2, Stravinsky&#x2019;s Petrouschka and Rite of Spring, Ravel&#x2019;s La Valse, and tone poems by Richard Strauss.
The orchestra has also premiered several new compositions in recent years.
</p>
<p>The <a>St.
Olaf Choir</a>, conducted by <a>Anton Armstrong '78</a>, was founded by Christiansen in 1907 as the St. John's Lutheran Church Choir in Northfield.
It is recognized as one of the premier collegiate ensembles in the United States.
It has toured Europe several times, as well as <a>China</a>, <a>Korea</a>, and <a>Australia</a>, performing before heads of state and producing more than a dozen recordings.
The choir performs in the nationally broadcast annual St. Olaf Christmas Festival, along with the St. Olaf Orchestra and four of the college's other choirs.
In 2005 the St. Olaf Choir was invited to perform at the White House for President George W. Bush, First Lady Laura Bush and guests to commemorate The National Day of Prayer.</p>
<p>Other student musical ensembles include Chapel Choir, Cantorei, Manitou Singers, Viking Chorus, Collegiate Chorale, Philharmonia, Norseman Band and many smaller vocal and instrumental ensembles.
Two student-run music ensembles at St. Olaf that receive the most recognition are the men's and women's a capella groups: <em>The Limestones</em> and <em>Agnes</em>.
These groups are not a part of the college's music program and operate independently.</p>
<p>In 2005 the St. Olaf Band, St. Olaf Orchestra, and St. Olaf Choir toured throughout Norway to celebrate its centennial of independence from Sweden.</p>
<p>A few ensembles that sprouted their roots at St. Olaf include the Minnesota Symphonic Winds and the a cappella choral groups Cantus, Inpulse and <a>Magnum Chorum</a>.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p>[[File:090926-Saint-Olaf-vs-Augsburg-American-Football.jpg|thumb|right|[[American
football]] at St. Olaf in 2009.]]
St. Olaf College is a member of the <a>Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference</a> (MIAC).
St. Olaf athletic teams and students are nicknamed the &quot;Oles.&quot;
St. Olaf's <a>Swimming</a> and <a>Diving</a> team is traditionally the strongest of its sports teams, having won a majority of its MIAC conference championships, and is strongly competitive at the national level, often finishing within the top ten NCAA Division III schools at nationals.
St. Olaf competes in the following sports:</p>
<p></p>
<p>St.
Olaf also has many student coached club and <a>intramural</a> teams that compete within the student body and also inter-college.
Most notable are the St. Olaf <a>Ultimate</a> teams, The Berzerkers and Durga, which make an annual trip to a national collegiate tournament (Spring Ultimax) in <a>North Carolina</a>.</p>
<h3>Rivalry with Carleton College</h3>
<p>St.
Olaf is a traditional athletic rival of its crosstown neighbor, <a>Carleton College</a>.
Each year in <a>American football</a>, Carleton and St. Olaf compete in a contest recently dubbed the &quot;Cereal Bowl&quot; in honor of the <a>Malt-O-Meal</a> production facility that is located in Northfield.
In this contest, the Oles had a winning streak 1995-2007 before losing in 2008 21-7.
The annual winner receives the &quot;Goat Trophy&quot; (created by a St. Olaf carpenter in 1931) as well as the silver Cereal Bowl trophy.</p>
<p>The rivalry between St. Olaf and Carleton, which began with a Carleton victory over St. Olaf in 1919, is one of the oldest in all of college football, and the only to feature two colleges from the same <a>ZIP code</a>.</p>
<p>A lesser known fact about the Cereal Bowl is that Northfield's veterans' memorial (located in Bridge Square) features an eagle that is turned to face the college that wins the annual football match between the two schools.</p>
<p>These football teams are also significant for constituting the only <a>NCAA</a>-sanctioned metric football game in history (which St. Olaf won).</p>
<h3>College fight song</h3>
<p>Based on a Norwegian folk tune, the college song, <em>Um Yah Yah</em>, is the only college <a>fight song</a> in the United States to be in 3/4 (waltz) meter.
It is also one of the few college songs to mention another college in its lyrics.
Other fight songs that mention rival schools include those of <a>Texas A&amp;M University</a>, the <a>University of California, Los Angeles</a> (UCLA), the <a>University of Alabama</a>, the <a>University of Texas</a>, <a>Georgetown University</a>, <a>Williams College</a>, <a>Georgia Institute of Technology</a>, and <a>Boston University</a> (in the &quot;unofficial&quot; lyrics to the fight song).</p>
<p>The lyrics to the St. Olaf song include the unofficial St. Olaf &quot;battle cry&quot; - &quot;Um Yah Yah!&quot;.
The most common version uses the name of traditional cross-town rival, <a>Carleton College</a>, but the current opposing institution's name is inserted when sung at athletic competitions.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>We come from St. Olaf, we sure are the real stuff.&lt;br
/&gt;Our team is the cream of the colleges great.&lt;br
/&gt;We fight fast and furious, our team is injurious.&lt;br
/&gt;Tonight Carleton College will sure meet its fate.</p>
<p>&lt;br /&gt;Um Yah Yah! Um Yah Yah!&lt;br /&gt;Um Yah Yah! Um Yah Yah!&lt;br /&gt;Um Yah Yah! Um Yah Yah!&lt;br /&gt; Um Yah Yah YAH!</p>
  <p>&lt;br /&gt;Um Yah Yah! Um Yah Yah!&lt;br /&gt;Um Yah Yah! Um Yah Yah!&lt;br /&gt;Um Yah Yah! Um Yah Yah!&lt;br /&gt;Um Yah Yah YAH!</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>St.
Olaf College in popular culture</h2>
<p>St.
Olaf is mentioned in the works of Minnesota author <a>F.
Scott Fitzgerald</a>, whose character <a>Jay Gatsby</a> of <em><a>The Great Gatsby</a></em> attended the college briefly and worked as a janitor.
The college also has been mentioned in <a>Garrison Keillor</a>'s radio program <em><a>A Prairie Home Companion</a></em>, which broadcast its show from St. Olaf Nov. 17, 2001.
</p>
<p>The fictional Minnesota city of St. Olaf was the hometown of <a>Rose Nylund</a> in the <a>TV</a> show <em><a>The Golden Girls</a></em>.
In the TV show the fictional city's sister city was St. Gustav, Minnesota, a nod to <a>Gustavus Adolphus College</a>, located in nearby <a>St.
Peter, Minnesota</a>.
Betty White, the actress who played Rose, visited the St. Olaf campus on one occasion and was given an honorary membership in St. Olaf's chapter of the theater honorary society.</p>
<p>The St. Olaf Choir can be heard performing Mozart's Requiem with the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra in Nike's &quot;Jordan XXII-Takeover&quot; commercial.
The St. Olaf Choir was also heard on the soundtrack of the 1972 film <a>The Great Northfield Minnesota Raid</a>.</p>
<p>In October 2008 the <a>Coen Brothers</a> shot scenes at St. Olaf for their film <em><a>A Serious Man</a></em>.</pre>
<p>After a long search of many campuses, the Coen brothers chose St. Olaf's old Science Center because it had the late 1960s look of the movie.
St. Olaf has built a new science center and is currently remodeling the old building.</p>
