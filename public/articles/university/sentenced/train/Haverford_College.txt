<p> <strong>Haverford College</strong> is a <a>private</a>, <a>coeducation</a>al <a>liberal arts college</a> located in <a>Haverford</a>, <a>Pennsylvania</a>, a suburb of <a>Philadelphia</a>.
All students at the college are <a>undergraduate</a>s, and almost all live on campus.</p>
<p>The college was founded in 1833 by area members of the Orthodox <a>Philadelphia Yearly Meeting</a> of the <a>Religious Society of Friends</a> (Quakers) to ensure an education grounded in <a>Quaker</a> values for young Quaker men.
Although the college no longer has a formal religious affiliation, the <a>Quaker</a> philosophy still influences campus life.
Originally an all-male institution, <a>Haverford</a> began admitting female transfer students in the 1970s and became fully <a>co-ed</a> in 1980.
Currently, more than half of Haverford's students are women.
For most of the 20th century, Haverford's total enrollment was kept below 300, but the school went through two periods of expansion after the 1970s, and its current enrollment is 1,190 students.
</p>
<p>Known for its rigorous academics and resistance to grade inflation, Haverford has been described as &quot;quietly prestigious.&quot;
It placed ninth in the <em><a>U.S. News and World Report</a></em> rankings of U.S. liberal arts colleges in 2010 and is commonly known as one of the &quot;<a>Little Ivies</a>&quot;.
</p>
<p>Haverford is a member of the <a>Tri-College Consortium</a>, which allows students to register for courses at both <a>Bryn Mawr College</a> and <a>Swarthmore College</a>.
The college enjoys an especially close relationship with <a>Bryn Mawr College</a>.
It is also a member of the <a>Quaker Consortium</a> (&quot;Penn-Pal&quot;) which allows students to cross-register at the College of General Studies (CGS) and the <a>Wharton School of Business</a> at the <a>University of Pennsylvania</a>.</p>
<h2>Honor Code</h2>
<p>In 1896, the students and faculty of Haverford voted to adopt an <a>Honor Code</a> to govern academic affairs.
Since then, every student has been allowed to schedule his or her own final exams.
Take-home examinations are also common at Haverford.
These exams may include strict instructions such as time limits, prohibitions on using assigned texts or personal notes, and <a>calculator</a> usage.
All students are bound to follow these instructions by the Code.</p>
<p><a>thumb|left|350px|Founders Hall, the centerpiece of the Haverford campus</a></p>
<p>Originally conceived as a code of academic honesty, the <a>Honor Code</a> had expanded by the 1970s to govern social interactions.
The code does not list specific rules of behavior, but rather outlines a philosophy of trust, concern, and respect for others that students are expected to follow.
When a student (or other community member) feels that another student has broken the Code, he or she is encouraged not to look the other way but rather to confront the possible offender and engage in a dialogue with him or her, before taking matters to an Honor Council which can help mediate the dispute.
Ideally, many potential violations are worked out through dialogue (mediated or not) and common understanding.</p>
<p>Student government officers administer the Code, and all academic matters are heard by student juries.
More severe matters are addressed by administrators.
Abstracts from cases heard by students and joint administrative-student panels are distributed to all students by several means, including as print-outs in mailboxes.
The trial abstracts are made anonymous by the use of <a>pseudonyms</a>, which are often characters from entertainment or history.</p>
<p>The student body convenes every semester in a <a>plenary session</a> with a 50 percent quorum.
At these meetings, the Honor Code or Student Constitution can be amended, and at Spring Plenary the student body votes to put the Honor Code up for ratification (now done electronically with 2/3 quorum).
In addition to revisions of self-governance, the student body debates resolutions that get passed to the faculty and administration for approval and action.
</p>
<p>The Honor Code is touted by the Office of Admissions, and every student is required to sign a pledge agreeing to the Code prior to matriculation.
Unlike Honor Codes at institutions such as <a>Brigham Young University</a>, which are imposed on the students by the administration, the <a>Haverford</a> Honor Code is entirely student-run.
The Code originated with a body of students who felt it necessary, and current Haverford students administer and amend it every year.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>Haverford offers <a>Bachelor of Arts</a> and <a>Bachelor of Science</a> degrees.
Students may choose among 31 majors in the natural sciences, social sciences and the humanities.
In the 1950s, <a>Haverford</a> was the first institution in America to teach modern laboratory biology (<a>molecular biology</a>) to undergraduates.
In addition, the only <a>National Academy of Sciences</a> member to teach at a liberal arts college today is at <a>Haverford</a>.
Both <a>physics</a> and <a>chemistry</a> departments boast graduates including <a>Nobel laureate</a>s.
Additional program and course offerings are available via the <a>Quaker Consortium</a>.</p>
<p>Almost all departments require a <a>senior thesis</a> or project for graduation, and many departments also have junior-level <a>seminar</a> or year-long project such as in <a>biology</a> (superlab) and <a>chemistry</a> (superlab).
The College also maintains a distribution requirement, spreading course work in all three areas of <a>humanities</a>, <a>social sciences</a> and <a>natural sciences</a>, in addition to major course works.
</p>
<p>In addition to majors and minors, Haverford offers concentrations in <a>Africana studies</a>, <a>biochemistry</a>, <a>biophysics</a>, <a>computer science</a>, <a>East Asian studies</a>, <a>education</a>, <a>feminist</a> and <a>gender studies</a>, health and society, <a>Latin American</a> and <a>Iberian studies</a>, <a>mathematical economics</a>, neural and <a>behavioral sciences</a>, and <a>peace studies</a>.
Students may pursue pre-medical, pre-law or pre-business intentions through any major; the college offers special advising by professionals in those fields.
Music students enjoy close proximity to <a>Philadelphia</a>'s music tradition: the <a>Philadelphia Orchestra</a> and <a>The Curtis Institute of Music</a>, where students can receive discounted concert tickets and take on extra instrument or voice lessons.</p>
<p>An additional option is the &quot;3/2 liberal arts and engineering&quot; course of study.
This allows students to take three years of liberal arts and science courses at Haverford and then two years of engineering courses at the <a>California Institute of Technology</a>.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>The northwest portion of the campus is located in <a>Haverford Township</a> in <a>Delaware County</a>, and the southwest part of the campus is located in <a>Lower Merion Township</a> in <a>Montgomery County</a>.</p>

The buildings on campus are mostly stone and reflect Quaker and colonial design principles.
Recent renovations and additions within the last 5 years include a center for science (The Integrated Natural Science Center, or INSC) and a new athletics center (The Douglas B. Gardner '83 Integrated Athletic Center).
Planned additions in the future include renovations for a larger humanities center, new performing arts space, a student center and a new dorm to decompress current housing.
</p>
<p>Much of the student body (99%) lives on campus, where housing options include apartments, themed houses such as <a>Yarnall House</a>, and traditional dormitories.
Various options for housing exist, including suites of singles, doubles, and triples.
Housing policy is very liberal and many non-freshman suites are co-ed.
In 2000, at the urging of Haverford&#x2019;s inQUEERy, co-ed roommate options were officially permitted for the first time, having occurred without official sanction since 1974.
</p>
<p>Approximately 75% of faculty live on campus, which is unusually high for liberal arts colleges.
</p>
<p>Local attractions within walking distance include <a>Wawa</a>, <a>IHOP</a>, and <a>Chipotle</a>.
<a>Merion Golf Club</a> and Suburban Square are also located within walking distance.</p>
<p><a>Haverford</a> is located on the <a>Main Line</a> about  west of <a>Philadelphia</a>.
The school is connected to center city Philadelphia by the <a>Paoli/Thorndale Line</a> commuter rail system and <a>Norristown High Speed Line</a> (R100).</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<p>Activities available at Haverford range from the usual small college options of <a>a cappella</a> singing group performances, alternative concerts, student film screenings, and <a>improv comedy</a>, to smaller adventures, such as tag or <a>sardines</a> in the sciences center.</p>
<p>Free music events are often presented in the basement of Lunt (a student dorm), adjacent to the always-popular <a>Lunt Caf&#x00e9;</a>.
Professional funk, rock, blues, and jazz bands are brought in by the Federation of United Concert Series, a student organization.
Student musicians have created a vibrant musical community on campus, forming a number of bands with eclectic styles.
Haverford boasts practice facilities, a recording studio, and a record label, Black Squirrel Records, which releases compilation albums that feature Haverford student bands.
Students also run their own radio station, WHRC Radio, which broadcasts <a>streaming audio</a>.</p>
<p>Student publications include the Bi-College News, a newspaper in collaboration with students at <a>Bryn Mawr College</a> that serves both campuses; <a>Feathers &amp; Fur</a>, a fashion magazine also in collaboration with students at <a>Bryn Mawr College</a>; The Haverford Review, a student literary magazine; <a>Without a (Noun)</a>, the Haverford satire/humor magazine; the Haverford Journal, an academic journal; and The Record, the student yearbook.</p>
<p>Many students are involved in volunteering, either on their own or through Haverford's volunteer coordination organization, Eighth Dimension.
Volunteer opportunities are especially plentiful due to Haverford's proximity to Philadelphia.
Activism is also a part of student life, and groups such as the Sexuality and Gender Alliance (SAGA), Students Toward a New Democracy (STAND), Amnesty International, College Republicans, and College Democrats have a presence on campus.
The student body tends to be politically liberal, but is not without its vocal conservative elements.
High value is placed in listening to many sides without disrespect or vitriol, in spirit with the Honor Code.</p>
<p>The college has regular college-sponsored events, such as a &quot;Screw-Your-Roommate&quot; Dance, where roommates set each other up on blind dates.
Haverford has no fraternities or sororities, but <a>Drinker House</a> is considered to be the closest resemblance to one on campus.</p>
<p>In 2002, a group of students founded a computing club called FIG (a <a>recursive acronym</a> for FIG Is Good).
Services provided by FIG include the college's student portal, Go!, server space for students, and an online discussion forum called the Go! Boards.
Amid controversy, the boards have become a major venue for discussion on campus as well as providing a popular method of procrastination.</p>
<p>Of the nation's 357 &quot;best&quot; colleges, the Princeton Review ranks Haverford as #6 for Best Overall Undergraduate Experience.
In addition, Haverford, unlike many of its peers, is located within easy travel of a large metropolitan center and the opportunities that <a>Philadelphia</a> offers.</p>
<p><a>Princeton Review</a> placed Haverford on several other lists for the 2007 year.
On the list for &quot;Best Overall Academic Experience for Undergraduates,&quot; Haverford ranks #8; &quot;School Runs Like Butter,&quot; #17; &quot;The Toughest to Get Into,&quot; #20; &quot;Best Quality Of Life,&quot; #14; &quot;Happiest Students,&quot; #16.</p>
