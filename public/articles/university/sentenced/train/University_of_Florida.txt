<p>The <strong>University of Florida</strong> (commonly referred to as <strong>Florida</strong>, <strong>UF</strong> or <strong>U of F</strong>) is an <a>American</a> <a>public</a> <a>land-grant</a>, <a>sea-grant</a>, and <a>space-grant</a> <a>research university</a> located on a  campus in <a>Gainesville, Florida</a>.
The university traces its historical origins to 1853, and has operated continuously on its present Gainesville campus since September 1906.
It has been included among the so-called &quot;<a>Public Ivy</a>&quot; universities&mdash;one of the top public universities in the United States.
The University of Florida is currently ranked fifty-third overall among all national universities, public and private, in the current 2011 <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></em> <a>rankings</a> and consistently ranks within the top 100 universities worldwide.</p>
<p>The University of Florida is an elected member of the <a>Association of American Universities</a> (AAU), an organization composed of sixty-three American and Canadian research universities.
It is one of three &quot;research flagship universities&quot; within the <a>State University System of Florida</a>, as designated by the <a>Florida Legislature</a>.</p>
<p>It is the second-largest Florida university by <a>student population</a>, and receives the highest academic marks in the state of Florida as measured by national and international rankings of American colleges and universities.
The university is also the sixth largest single-campus university in the United States by <a>student population</a>, with 49,679 students enrolled for the fall 2009 semester.
The University of Florida is home to seventeen academic colleges and more than 150 research centers and institutes.
It offers multiple graduate professional programs&mdash;including <a>business administration</a>, <a>engineering</a>, <a>law</a> and <a>medicine</a>&mdash;on one contiguous campus, and administers 123 <a>master's degree</a> programs and seventy-six <a>doctoral degree</a> programs in eighty-seven schools and departments.

Tower (University of Florida)|Century Tower]], begun in 1953, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the founding of university and as a tribute to the alumni who perished in both <a>World War I</a> and <a>World War II</a>.]]</p>
<p>The University of Florida traces its origins to 1853, when the <a>East Florida Seminary</a>, one of the University of Florida's four predecessor institutions, was founded in <a>Ocala, Florida</a>.</p>
<p>On January 6, 1853, <a>Florida Governor</a> <a>Thomas Brown</a> signed a bill that provided public support for <a>higher education</a> in the state of <a>Florida</a>.
Gilbert Kingsbury was the first person to take advantage of the legislation, and established the <a>East Florida Seminary</a>.
The East Florida Seminary was the first state-supported institution of higher learning in Florida.
James Henry Roper, an educator from <a>North Carolina</a> and a <a>state senator</a> from <a>Alachua County</a>, built a school, the <a>Gainesville Academy</a>, around the same time.
In 1866, after East Florida Seminary had closed during the <a>American Civil War</a>,  Roper offered his land and school to the State of Florida in exchange for the relocation of <a>East Florida Seminary</a> to Gainesville.</p>
<p>The second major precursor to the University of Florida was the <a>Florida Agricultural College</a>, established at <a>Lake City</a> by Jordan Probst in 1884.
Florida Agricultural College became the state's first <a>land-grant college</a> under the <a>Morrill Act</a>.
In 1903, the <a>Florida Legislature</a>, desiring to expand the school's outlook and curriculum beyond its agricultural and engineering origins, changed the name of Florida Agricultural College to the &quot;University of Florida,&quot; a name that the school would hold for only two years.</p>
<h3>&quot;University of the State of Florida&quot;</h3>
<p>In 1905, the <a>Buckman Act</a> consolidated the colleges of the state.
The member of the <a>Florida Legislature</a> who wrote the act, <a>Henry Holland Buckman</a>, is the namesake of <a>Buckman Hall</a>, one of the university's oldest buildings.
The Buckman Act reorganized the <a>State University System of Florida</a> and empowered the <a>Florida Board of Control</a> to govern the system.
The Act also mandated the merger of four pre-existing state-supported institutions into the new <strong>University of the State of Florida</strong>: the <strong><a>University of Florida at Lake City</a></strong> (formerly Florida Agricultural College) in <a>Lake City</a>, the <strong><a>East Florida Seminary</a></strong> in Gainesville, the <strong><a>St.
Petersburg Normal and Industrial School</a></strong> in <a>St.
Petersburg</a>, and the <strong><a>South Florida Military College</a></strong> in <a>Bartow</a>.</p>
<p>The Buckman Act also consolidated the colleges and schools into three institutions segregated by race and sex&#x2014;the University of the State of Florida for white men, the Florida Female College for white women, and the State Normal School for Colored Students for African-American men and women.</p>
<p>The City of Gainesville, led by its Mayor <a>William Reuben Thomas</a>, campaigned to be home to the new university.
On July 6, 1905, the Board of Control selected <a>Gainesville</a> for the new university campus.
<a>Andrew Sledd</a>, president of the pre-existing <a>University of Florida at Lake City</a>, was selected to be the first president of the new University of the State of Florida.
The 1905-1906 academic year was a year of transition; the new University of the State of Florida was legally created, but operated on the campus of the old University of Florida in Lake City until the buildings on the new campus in Gainesville were completed.
Architect William A. Edwards designed the first official campus buildings in the <a>Collegiate Gothic</a> style.
Classes began on new Gainesville campus on September 26, 1906 with 102 students.</p>
<p>In 1909, the name of the school was officially simplified from the &quot;University of the State of Florida&quot; to the &quot;University of Florida.&quot;</p>
<p>The <a>alligator</a> was incidentally chosen as the school mascot in 1911, after a local vendor ordered and sold school pennants with an alligator imprinted on them.
The school colors, orange and blue, are believed to be derived from the blue and white school colors of the University of Florida at Lake City and the orange and black colors of the East Florida Seminary at Gainesville.</p>
<p>[[File:MurphreeStatue.jpg|right|thumb|Statue of [[Albert Murphree]], the second president of the university.]]</p>
<h3>College reorganization</h3>
<p>In 1909, <a>Albert Murphree</a> was appointed the second president of the university, and organized several of the colleges of the university, increased enrollment from under 200 to over 2,000, and he was instrumental in the founding of the <a>Florida Blue Key</a> leadership society.
Murphree is the only University of Florida president honored with a statue on the campus.</p>
<p><a>left|thumb|The University of Florida campus in 1916, looking southwest.</a></p>
<p>In 1924, the Florida Legislature mandated that women of a &quot;mature age&quot; (at least twenty-one years old) who had completed sixty semester hours from a &quot;reputable educational institution&quot; would be allowed to enroll during regular semesters at the University of Florida in programs that were unavailable at Florida State College for Women.
Before this, only the summer semester was coeducational, to accommodate women teachers who wanted to further their education during the summer break.
<a>Lassie Goodbread-Black</a> from Lake City became the first woman to enroll at the University of Florida, in the College of Agriculture in 1925.</p>
<p><a>John J. Tigert</a> became the third university president in 1928.
Disgusted by the under-the-table payments being made by universities to athletes, Tigert established the grant-in-aid <a>athletic scholarship</a> program in the early 1930s, which was the genesis of the modern athletic scholarship plan that is currently used by the <a>National Collegiate Athletic Association</a>.</p>
<h3>Post World War II</h3>
<p>Beginning in 1946, there was dramatically increased interest among male applicants who wanted to attend the University of Florida, mostly returning World War II veterans who could attend college under the <a>GI Bill of Rights</a> (Servicemen's Readjustment Act).
Unable to immediately accommodate this increased demand, the Florida Board of Control opened the <strong>Tallahassee Branch of the University of Florida</strong> on the campus of Florida State College for Women in <a>Tallahassee</a>.
By the end of the 1946&ndash;1947 school year, 954 men were enrolled at the Tallahassee Branch.
The following semester, the <a>Florida Legislature</a> returned the Florida State College for Women to coeducational status and renamed it <a>Florida State University</a>.
This sequence of events also opened up all of the colleges that comprise the University of Florida to female students.
African-American students were allowed to enroll starting in 1958.
<a>Shands Hospital</a> first opened in 1958 along with the <a>University of Florida College of Medicine</a> to join the already established <a>College of Pharmacy</a>.
Rapid campus expansion began in the 1950s and continues to the present day.</p>
<h3>National and international prominence</h3>
<p>In 1985, the University of Florida was invited to become a member of the <a>Association of American Universities</a> (AAU), an organization composed of now sixty-three academically prominent public and private research universities in the United States and Canada.
Florida is one of only seventeen public, land-grant universities that belong to the AAU.
In 2009, President <a>Bernie Machen</a> and the <a>University of Florida Board of Trustees</a> announced a major policy transition for the university.
The Board of Trustees supported the reduction in the number of undergraduates and the shift of financial and other academic resources to graduate education and research in the future.</p>
<p>The University of Florida has continued to rise in the <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></em> <a>college and university rankings</a>.
In 2001, Florida was labeled a <a>Public Ivy</a> and was second in <a>Kiplinger</a>'s 2009 &quot;Best Buys of Education&quot; (behind the <a>University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</a>).
<em>U.S. News</em> currently ranks the university as the forty-seventh best national university; the state policy-makers, university administrators and Florida alumni are actively working to advance the university as a top-10 public university.</p>

<p>In 2010, <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></em> ranked the University of Florida as the fifteenth best public university in the United States, and 53rd overall among all national universities, public and private.
In addition, <em>U.S. News</em> also ranked Florida as one of the ten most popular national universities in the country, based on &quot;yield rates&quot;&mdash;the percentages of students who actually enroll after being accepted.</p>
<p>The 2007 <a>Academic Ranking of World Universities</a> list assessed the university as 51st among world universities and 38th in the United States based on overall research output and faculty awards.
In 2009 <a>Washington Monthly</a> ranked the University of Florida 26th overall.
For 2007, <em><a>Newsweek</a></em> ranked UF one of the &quot;Top 25 Hottest Schools&quot;.</p>
<p>Another study by the Research Center for Chinese Science Evaluation of <a>Wuhan University</a> ranks Florida 37th in the world.
The ranking is based on Essential Science Indicators (ESI), which provides data of journal article publication counts and citation frequencies in over 11,000 journals around the world in 22 research fields.</p>
<p>Florida ranked 2nd among all universities in <a>Kiplinger</a>'s &quot;100 Best Values in Public Colleges&quot; (2006, 2007 &amp; 2008) and 4th in <em>The Scientist</em> magazine's &quot;Best Places to Work in Academia&quot; (2005); its was also ranked the best overall in top values amongst all the public <a>flagship universities</a> by <a>USA Today</a> (2006).
The university admitted 1,049 <a>International Baccalaureate</a> students for the 2004-2005 academic year - more than any other university in the world.
The freshmen retention rate of 94 percent is among the highest in the U.S.</p>
<p>UF's job/career placement services were ranked 13th best in the nation by &quot;<a>The Princeton Review</a>&quot; in its &quot;2009 <em>Best 368 Colleges</em> Rankings&quot;.</p>
<p>The strictly measured federal graduation rate for athletes, playing an NCAA sport, was 42% for freshmen who entered between 2000 and 2002.
This is one of the lower rates in the country for a large university.</p>
<h3>Admissions</h3>
<p> As the acceptance rate at the University of Florida has trended downward, the application process has become increasingly competitive.
The university has a freshmen retention rate of 94%.
For the first-year students that enrolled at UF in 2008, the average combined math and verbal SAT score, as disclosed in the Common Data Set, is 1240&ndash;1410 (25th to 75th percentile), and the average high school grade point average (GPA) was 4.1&ndash;4.4
(25th to 75th percentile).</p>
<p>In the words of <em><a>Sarasota Herald-Tribune</a></em> reporter Anna Scott, &quot;Three years after university officials capped the size of the freshman class at about 6,600, competition at UF is at an all-time high, forcing admissions officers to choose among the brightest and leaving behind an unprecedented number of disappointed families.
Of those who applied to be part of last fall's incoming freshman class, an estimated 36.92 percent were accepted -- the lowest acceptance rate in the history of the state's public schools.&quot;
Selectivity at the state's top university is expected to heighten as UF continues to work toward becoming one of the nation's Top 10 public universities.
These universities assert that early decision admissions forces students to accept an offer of admission before evaluating the <a>financial aid</a> offers from multiple universities.
The university's single application deadline has been set for November 1.</p>

<h3>Student government</h3>
<p><a>thumb|180px|left|Seal for the UF Student Government</a> The <strong>University of Florida <a>Student Government</a></strong> is the governing body of students who attend the University of Florida, representing the university's more than 50,000 undergraduate, graduate and professional students.
The university's student government currently operates on a yearly $16.7 million dollar budget, one of the largest student government budgets in the United States, and is decided by a Legislative Senate Budget Committee.</p>
<p>The student government was established in 1909 and consists of executive, judicial and unicameral legislative branches.
The executive branch includes the student government president, vice president and treasurer elected by the student body during the spring semester, as well as nine agencies and forty-one cabinet members.</p>
<p>The student senate is the legislative branch, and is composed of 100 senators who serve one-year terms.
The student body elects fifty senators during each spring semester and the remaining fifty during the fall semester.
The senators elect a senate president and senate President pro tempore twice a year, after each semester's elections, to lead the student senate.
During student government elections students may also vote on referendums, such as the renewable energy referendum, which was approved by 78% of voting students in the spring of 2007.
This referendum proposed a fifty-cents-per-credit-hour increase to student activity fees to fund renewable energy and efficiency on campus.</p>
<p>The student government judicial branch has three major components: the student supreme court (headed by a chief justice), the student honor court (headed by the honor court chancellor elected each spring), and the student traffic court (headed by a chief justice).
The supreme court consists of five second or third-year law students nominated by the student government president and confirmed by the student senate.
Each justice serves a &quot;life-time&quot; term, which extends through the individual justice's graduation and insulates the court from the politics of student government.
The chief justice may appoint a marshal and clerk.
The election commission, which listens and adjudicates all student government election complaints, is also part of the judicial branch.
The commission includes 6 members, one of whom also serves as the commission chairman.</p>
