<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>A native of <a>Connecticut</a>, Burr was born in 1716 in present day <a>Fairfield</a> to Daniel Burr, a wealthy landowner.
He was of <a>English</a> ancestry.
His grandfather Jehu Burr [<a>http://www.familysearch.org/eng/default.asp</a>]
(1625 - 1692) was born in <a>Lavenham</a>, <a>Suffolk, England</a> and settled in the <a>Connecticut Colony</a>.
Aaron Burr attended <a>Yale College</a> (now Yale University), where he obtained a B.A. in 1735.
After graduation, he became a <a>Presbyterian</a> minister in <a>Newark, New Jersey</a>, also conducting a school in <a>classical</a> studies there.
In 1752, he married <a>Esther Edwards</a>, daughter of the <a>New England</a> divine, <a>Jonathan Edwards</a>, and his wife <a>Sarah</a>, daughter of the Rev. <a>James Pierpont</a>.
Jonathan Edwards was a leader of the <a>First Great Awakening</a>, a significant religious movement of the 1730s and 1740s.</p>
<p>In the 1740s, a controversy over religious doctrines led to a split in the faculty and student body at Yale.
In opposition to Yale's first president, the Rev. <a>Thomas Clap</a>, <a>Jonathan Edwards</a>, Burr, and <a>Jonathan Dickinson</a> founded the College of New Jersey (now <a>Princeton University</a>) at <a>Elizabeth, New Jersey</a>, in 1746.
Dickinson was elected first president of the College, but died soon after in 1747.
Burr then became the second president.
During his tenure (1748&ndash;1757), the curriculum was settled, the student body increased significantly, and the College moved to its permanent home at <a>Princeton, New Jersey</a>.
He supervised the construction of <a>Nassau Hall</a>, Princeton's best-known structure, completed in 1756.
Burr, elected at age 32, was also the youngest person ever to serve as president of Princeton.</p>

<p>In 1755, Burr was relieved of his pastoral duties in order to concentrate full-time on his work at Princeton.
In the fall of 1757, Burr died in Princeton of fever, believed to have been brought on or aggravated by overwork.
His remains were interred in the President's Lot at <a>Princeton Cemetery</a>.</p>
