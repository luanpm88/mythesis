<h3>Beginnings</h3>
<p>Temple University was founded in 1884 by Dr. Russell Conwell, a <a>Yale</a>-educated <a>Boston</a> lawyer, orator, and ordained <a>Baptist</a> <a>minister</a>, who had served in the <a>Union Army</a> during the <a>American Civil War</a>.
Conwell came to Philadelphia in 1882 to lead the Grace Baptist Church while he began tutoring working class citizens late at night to accommodate their work schedules.
These students, later dubbed &quot;night owls,&quot; were taught in the basement of Conwell's Baptist Temple, hence where the University receives its name.
The Grace Baptist Church quickly grew popular within the North Philadelphia area.
A temporary board of trustees was created to handle the rapidly growing formalities associated with the church's programs.
When the board conducted its first meeting they named Russell H. Conwell president of &#x201c;The Temple College.&#x201d;
Within the coming months, Grace Baptist Church appointed a new board of trustees, printed official admissions files, and issued stock to raise funds for new teaching facilities.
Regardless of whether they had the resources to support the school, Conwell&#x2019;s desire was &#x201c;to give education to those who were unable to get it through the usual channels&#x201d;.</p>
<p>Philadelphia granted a charter in 1888 to establish &#x201c;The Temple College of Philadelphia&#x201d;, but the city refused to grant authority to award academic degrees.
By 1888, the enrollment of the college was nearly 600.
It was in 1907 that Temple College revised its institutional status and incorporated as a university.
Legal recognition as a university enhanced Temple in noticeable ways including its reputation, professional and graduate programs, overall enrollment, and financial support.
university, meaning it receives public funds and offers reduced tuition for Pennsylvania residents but is under independent control.
This differs from the schools in the [[Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education]] (PASSHE) and is a status shared only with the [[University of Pittsburgh]] and the historically black [[Lincoln University (Pennsylvania)|Lincoln University]].
[[Pennsylvania State University]] is similarly a state-related university, although it is also a [[land-grant university]], putting it in a slightly different category.
Usually, tuition at [[Commonwealth System of Higher Education|state-related]] universities is higher than the tuition at the PASSHE schools due to the independence of the institution.</pre>
<h2>Schools and colleges</h2>
<p>Temple University has over 300 degree programs from 17 schools and colleges and 4 professional schools.
Bachelor's, master's, doctoral and professional programs are offered through the following academic units:</p>
<p>{| class=&quot;left wikitable&quot; </p>
<p><a>The Maurice H. Kornberg School of Dentistry</a>, established in 1863 as the Philadelphia Dental College, is the second-oldest dental school in continuous existence in the United States and for 140 years.
It has provided men and women with a strong academic and clinical background for the practice of general dentistry.</p>
<p>The <a>Temple University School of Medicine</a> opened its doors to students on September 16, 1901.
As the third coeducational medical college in Pennsylvania, it began as a night and weekend teaching venture to accommodate working people.
Classes were held initially in College Hall, next to Russell Herman Conwell's Baptist Temple Church, and clinical instruction was given at the Samaritan Hospital farther north on Broad Street.
The original medical school numbered 20 faculty with 35 students enrolled during the first year.
It remains fully accredited by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education.
It currently employs approximately 452 full-time faculty, 73 part-time faculty and 875 staff.
Each year it admits approximately 180 medical students and 24 graduate students.</p>

<h3>Main campus</h3>
<p>Temple University has seven campuses and sites across the state of Pennsylvania, as well as international campuses in Rome, Tokyo, Spain, and London.
The main campus is located in <a>North Philadelphia</a>, approximately  north of the center business district of <a>Center City, Philadelphia</a>.
The Temple University campus occupies one hundred and  of land in the center of <a>Philadelphia</a> with an estimated 10,000 students living on or around campus.

<h3>Separate campuses</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The <strong>Health Sciences Campus</strong> (HSC) is located in <a>North Philadelphia</a> specifically spanning Broad Street from Allegheny to Venango streets.
With two hospitals (pediatrics and teaching), a pharmacy college, a nursing college and a dental college, it has a strong reputation for integrating all areas of health care into one fluent system.
The medical and pharmacy schools are nationally renowned.
The pharmacy school in particular is unique in its approach to education of the profession by administering courses that focus more on clinical sensibilities to prepare its students for the new roles of the pharmacist as a health care provider in the coming decades.</li>
<li>The <strong>Temple University Center City</strong> (TUCC) campus is the adult education destination in Center City.
Surrounded by the home offices of major national corporations and just across the street from <a>Philadelphia City Hall</a> and <a>Suburban Station</a>, TUCC is also near most of the city's cultural and entertainment resources.
TUCC's serves the credit and non-credit education needs of area corporations and their employees and to provide enrichment opportunities for Philadelphia area residents.</li>
<li>The <a>Temple University Ambler</a> (TUA) campus was originally a <a>junior college</a>.
The Temple University Ambler Campus whose name was changed during the summer of 2009 to the School of Environmental Design, due to the campus' degree focus on Community and Regional Planning, Landscape Architecture, and Horticulture, and its specialization in environmental sustainability, now has 325 faculty and 4,600 students, offering bachelor's and master's degree programs on a 187 acre (757,000 m&#x00b2;) <a>arboretum</a>, located  from the main campus.</li>
<li><strong>Temple University Harrisburg</strong> (TUH) is located in the heart of downtown Harrisburg, the home of Pennsylvania&#x00b4;s state government and capitol.
The campus is located within the Strawberry Square complex, close to many state associations and businesses.

The campus offers graduate degrees in business, computer engineering, education, pharmacy and liberal arts.
Temple University Fort Washington was designed to serve adult professional graduate students and the educational needs of businesses in the area.
Temple&#x2019;s graduate programs in Business (MBA); Educational Administration (EdM); and Quality Assurance and Regulatory Affairs (QA/RA), formerly housed at Temple University Ambler, were moved to the Fort Washington location.
As a result, new and improved classroom space and computer resources became available to students at this new site.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Former campuses</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The <a>Tyler School of Art</a> campus, located in <a>Elkins Park, Pennsylvania</a>, was donated by Stella Elkins Tyler in the 1930s to dedicate as an art school.
That campus was closed and the school relocated to the main campus in the spring semester of 2009.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Campus safety</h3>
<p>Temple University implements one of the most comprehensive and effective college security forces in the United States.
Officers on campus play a pivotal role in the prevention of crime on campus and in the neighboring <a>North Philadelphia</a> community.
The Temple University Police department currently has 124 campus police officers, including supervisors and detectives.
Each officer is a Pennsylvania-certified law enforcement officer, who receive state-mandated police recruit training at an accredited state police academy  More than 600 campus security cameras help the department maintain an optimal view of the university and the surrounding community.
Temple also has a mass notification system, TU Alert.
The alert system is intended for use only to alert members of the campus community to a serious campus emergency that requires immediate action.</p>
<p>Since mid-2008, there has been more than six shootings on or near campus involving students as well as members of the surrounding community. .
The two most recent, on October 15th and 31st 2010, were only two weeks apart.
The shooting on the 15th was right on campus and a man was killed directly behind a student building, and the shooting on the 20th put a 20 year old student coming from a Halloween party on 17th street, a block the University considers &quot;safe&quot;, in critical condition.
Commentaries in <em>The Temple News,</em> suggest some students have been critical of the university's decision not to use its mass notification system, which is designed to send text messages and emails to students, faculty and staff in the event of imminent danger.
University officials have stated that the alert system is intended for use only to alert members of the campus community to a serious campus emergency that requires immediate action.
A commentary published in a Temple student blog warns that overusing the system could diminish the importance and urgency of alert notifications.</p>
<h2>Temple abroad</h2>
<h4>Temple University Japan</h4>
<p>, is a branch campus located in <a>Minato-ku</a>, <a>Tokyo</a>, <a>Japan</a>.
Temple University Japan is the oldest and largest campus of any foreign university in Japan, with an estimated 1,286 matriculated students, of which approximately one-half are Japanese, and one-half are either from the United States or more than 60 other countries.
Of this number, 851 are undergraduates, and 435 are in graduate programs (48 MBA, 154 Law and 233 TESOL).
<em>Non-degree</em> enrollment is about 978, and there are approximately 987 enrollments in continuing education programs.</p>
<p>The campus offers nine B.A., M.S.Ed., Ed.D., MBA and LL.M programs, as well as semester and year-long study abroad programs for U.S. undergraduates and law students (the latter is the first <a>American Bar Association</a>-accredited study abroad program in Asia).
In addition, Temple University Japan has non-degree English-language, continuing adult education, and corporate education programs.</p>
<p>After extended negotiations involving the U.S. and Japanese governments, Temple University Japan became the first recognized foreign university campus in Japan.
As a result, its credits and degrees are recognized as being equivalent to those of Japanese universities and can sponsor visas for international students.
Students are also given Japanese student identification cards and can obtain student discounts on train passes, mobile phone contracts, and other items.
The one remaining issue of contention between Temple University and the Japanese government is that the campus is taxed as a for-profit company, even though the main campus is a non-profit, state university.
This puts a significant financial burden on Temple University Japan and its students.</p>

White Residence Hall, 1940 Residence Hall, 1300 Residence Hall, Temple Towers Residence Hall, and The Edge at Avenue North.</p>
<p>Extensive renovations have been made to the existing Temple University dormitories to keep up with modern expectations.
Since 2006, both Johnson and Hardwick Residential Halls received complete renovations of their bathrooms and also received complete room restorations.
The Temple Towers Residential Hall saw the long awaited refurbishment of their student apartments with an addition of individual common areas and balconies to add more space to the student units.
The final Johnson and Hardwick restorations were completed in 2010 with the final renovation of a lobby with new entry points, security stations, office space, and lounge space.
Pending commonwealth budget funding, the Peabody Residential Hall is to receive upgrades to their common bathrooms in the near future.</p>
<p>As part of the Temple 20/20 plan, the university has plans to build a new 1700 bed three-building student mixed use residential, retail and cafeteria complex on the corner of Broad Street and Cecil B. Moore Avenue to open in the Fall 2011.
This would be the first university run building since the completion of 1300 Residence Hall in 2001.
The building will sit on the former site of the University Services Building which was demolished in January 2010.
The current University Service offices moved to a building off the Main Campus site.</p>
<h3>Johnson and Hardwick Halls</h3>
<p>The Johnson and Hardwick Residence Halls are 11-floor high rise facilities that are used as the traditional residence halls on the Main Campus.
The buildings house around 1,000 Temple students every year.

<h3>Peabody Hall</h3>
<p>The Gertrude Peabody Residence Hall is another traditionally styled dormitory on the Main Campus.
In 2006, the building celebrated its 50th anniversary.
Peabody Hall was originally designed as a women's residence hall with a campus cafeteria in the basement.
The residence hall building structure has since undergone many renovations to better serve modern students including a study/ conference room lounge, game room, fitness center, computer lab, kitchen, and new windows and air conditioning.
The Gertrude Peabody Residence Hall is also known to have been built on land that once occupied one of Russell Conwell's, Temple University's founder, original homes.</p>
<h3>Graduate housing</h3>

Many professors at Temple use &quot;Blackboard&quot; -- an online learning and scheduling system that electronically posts important class information such as homework, class cancellations, and announcements.
Faculty and students can receive technology assistance at Temple's Instructional Support Center.
In 2003, Fox School of Business began TUCAPTURE, an automated recording &amp; web casting system for classroom meetings.
In 2006, PC Magazine named Temple as the 15th Most Wired College in America, quoting CEO Tim O' Rourke about TUCAPTURE, attendance, and note taking.
In 2008, TUCAPTURE featured 40 classroom and mobile devices internationally and offers more than 900,000 minutes of classroom audio, visuals, video, and handwriting, delivered automatically via email, podcast, webcast, RSS, and Blackboard.</p>
<h3>Sustainability</h3>
<p>One of Hart&#x2019;s first directives as president of Temple University was to establish a Sustainability Task Force, composed of students, faculty and staff, to study best-practices in large, urban universities and recommend actions the university could take to create a sustainable campus culture.
As an outgrowth of the task forces&#x2019; recommendations, the Office of Sustainability was established on July 1, 2008, as a central resource focusing on four key areas: operations, academics, research, and outreach &amp; engagement.</p>
<p>The Ambler campus&#x2019; &#x2018;Ambler College&#x2019;, which is home to the Community and Regional Planning, Landscape Architecture, and Horticulture Departments, has changed their name in 2009 to the School of Environmental Design, due to the campus&#x2019; focus on environmental sustainability.
The campus is also home to the Center for Sustainable Communities, a Sustainability based research center.</p>
<p>Thus far, the university has: enacted policies that include purchasing from green vendors and conserving water and energy across campus; offered 46 undergraduate courses, 22 graduate courses and 12 General Education courses focusing on the environment and sustainability; set in place programs to administer grants and offer incentives for any research related to the environment or sustainability; and offered programs to help create a green culture, both at Temple and beyond.</p>
<h3>Temple 20/20</h3>
<p>Temple 20/20, a new framework to guide development at Temple&#x2019;s main campus, will make Broad Street the center point of the university and include a new library for students and the community; a large new green space; a new science building and a high rise residence hall.
Although the full plan has not been unveiled, highlights were recently reported by Philadelphia media.
The plan looks to expand Temple's structure of modernization exponentially, as well as improve the North Philadelphia community.</p>
<p>In accordance with the 20/20 plan, Temple wants to improve its most valuable piece of property, Broad Street.
Improvements to Broad Street will likely include a new library, a signature building and more shopping and dining areas.
Parking features will be expanded vertically with multi-level parking garages, instead of taking up valuable property space.
Another sure renovation, is the transformation of the Baptist Temple into a  &#x201c;theater-in-the-round-style&#x201d; concert hall, which will be home to Temple&#x2019;s orchestra and choir.</p>
<p>Under the plan, the  campus will remain the same size, with buildings growing vertically or going in place of current buildings.
To make the campus more open to the surrounding community, iron fencing will be removed from the boundaries.
The symbol was adopted in 1983.</p>
<h3>The Owl</h3>
<p>The <a>owl</a> is the <a>symbol</a> and <a>mascot</a> for Temple University and has been since its founding in 1888.
Temple was the first school in the United States to adopt the owl as its symbol.
The owl, a <a>nocturnal</a> hunter, was initially adopted as a symbol for Temple University because began as a night school for ambitious young people of limited means.
Russell Conwell encouraged these students with the remark: &quot;The owl of the night makes the eagle of the day.&quot;</p>
<h3>Fight Song</h3>
<p>Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various Temple University events, such as <a>commencement</a>, <a>convocation</a>, and athletic events, is the Temple University Fight Song.</p>

<h3>The Bell Tower</h3>
<p>The Bell Tower Plaza is located in the center of the Main Campus between Paley Library and Beury Hall.
The plaza is a popular student hangout and is the site of the Temple Bell Tower.
The Bell Tower serves as a central meeting place for students and is often the location for official events such as Spring Fling, protests, promotions, speeches, political campaigning, and charity drives by student organizations.
In warm weather, many students crowd onto the surrounding grass area, being the largest &quot;green space&quot; on the urban campus.
<a>A live web cam stream of the plaza is available online.</a></p>
<h3>Alumni Circle</h3>
<p>The Alumni Circle is located near the Founder's Garden on Liacouras Walk.
The monument's structure is uniquely designed to reflect sound, most notably by reverberating a spoken voice.
It was donated by a class and is a common stop for tours of campus and a popular site visited by alumni.</p>
<h3>Johnny Ring Garden</h3>
<p>Located off the faculty staff dining 'Diamond Club' this is a green area on campus commonly used for wedding photos and celebrates the history of Russell Conwell and Johnny Ring.</p>
<h3>Founders Garden</h3>
<p>The Founders Garden serves as the burial site for Dr. Russell Conwell.
His legacy for the founding and for his 38-year presidency at Temple is celebrated in the garden.
Conwell, a former Yale student, Civil War captain, Boston lawyer, and Philadelphia minister, utilized Temple as his vehicle to provide working class Philadelphians the opportunity for higher education.
It has been estimated that by the time Conwell died at age 82 he was responsible for over 100,000 men and women pursuing higher education.
Conwell used his income from his famous &#x201c;<a>Acres of Diamonds</a>&#x201d; speech to provide funding for Temple.</p>

<h2>Historical</h2>
<p>On April 2, 1965, <a>Lester B. Pearson</a>, <a>Prime Minister of Canada</a> and recipient of the <a>Nobel peace prize</a> was awarded the Temple University World Peace Prize.
During his acceptance speech Pearson criticised American bombing of <a>Vietnam</a>,</p>
<p><em>&quot;There are many factors which I am not in a position to weigh.
But there does appear to be at least a possibility that a suspension of such air strikes against North Vietnam, at the right time, might provide the Hanoi [communists] authorities with an opportunity, if they wish to take it, to inject some flexibility into their policy without appearing to do so as the direct result of military pressure&quot;</em></p>
<p>The seemingly harmless speech infuriated former President <a>Lyndon B. Johnson</a> who, the next day at <a>Camp David</a>, took Pearson out onto the terrace and began &quot;laying into [Pearson] in no uncertain fashion&quot;.
Pearson later apologized for the speech.</p>
