--&gt; <strong>Grinnell College</strong> is a private <a>liberal arts college</a> in <a>Grinnell</a>, <a>Iowa</a>, <a>U.S.</a> known for its strong tradition of <a>social activism</a> and rigorous academic environment.&lt;ref

It was founded in 1846, when a group of pioneer New England <a>Congregationalists</a> established the Trustees of Iowa College.

<h2>History</h2>
<p> [[Image:Josiah Bushnell Grinnell - Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Josiah
Bushnell Grinnell]]: founder of Grinnell Iowa and benefactor of Grinnell College.]]
[[File:Blair-hall-grinnell-college.jpg|thumb|right|[[Blair
Hall]]: Constructed between 1882-1886 and razed in 1961.]]
In 1843 eleven Congregational ministers, all of whom trained at <a>Andover Theological Seminary</a> in <a>Massachusetts</a>, set out to proselytize on the frontier.
Each man pledged to gather a church and together the group or band would seek to establish a college.
When the group arrived in Iowa later that year, each selected a different town in which to establish a congregation.
In 1846 they collectively established Iowa College in <a>Davenport</a>.
A few months later, Iowa joined the Union.</p>
<p>The first 25 years of Grinnell's history saw a change in name and location.
Iowa College moved farther west from Davenport, Iowa, to the town of Grinnell and unofficially adopted the name of its benefactor: an <a>abolitionist</a> minister, <a>Josiah Bushnell Grinnell</a>, to whom journalist <a>Horace Greeley</a> famously wrote &quot;<a>Go West, young man</a>, go West, and grow up with the country!&quot;
The name of the corporation &quot;The Trustees of Iowa College&quot; remained, but in 1909 the name &quot;Grinnell College&quot; was adopted by the trustees for the institution.
</p>
<p>In its early years, the College experienced setbacks.
Although two students received bachelor of arts degrees in 1854 (the first to be granted by a college west of the <a>Mississippi River</a>), within 10 years the <a>Civil War</a> had claimed most of Grinnell's students and professors.
In the decade following the war, growth resumed: women were officially admitted as candidates for degrees, and the curriculum was enlarged to include then-new areas of academic studies, such as <a>natural sciences</a> with laboratory work.
</p>
<p>In 1882, Grinnell College was struck by a tornado &#x2014; then called a cyclone, after which the college yearbook was named.
The storm devastated the campus and destroyed both College buildings.
Rebuilding began immediately, and the determination to expand wasn't limited to architecture: the curriculum was again extended to include departments in <a>political science</a> (the first in the United States) and modern languages.</p>
<p>Grinnell became known as the center of the <a>Social Gospel</a> reform movement,&lt;ref&gt;. see footnote 4.&lt;/ref&gt; as Robert Handy writes, &quot;The movement centered on the campus of Iowa (now Grinnell) College.
Its leading figures were <a>Professor George D. Herron</a> and President George A. Gates&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Other firsts pointed to the lighter side of college life: the first intercollegiate <a>football</a> and <a>baseball</a> games west of the Mississippi were played in Grinnell, and the home teams won.
</p>
<p>As the 20th century began, Grinnell established a <a>Phi Beta Kappa</a> chapter, introduced the departmental &quot;major&quot; system of study, began Grinnell-in-China (an educational mission that lasted until the <a>Japanese invasion</a> and resumed in 1987), and built a women's residence hall system that became a national model.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The social consciousness fostered at Grinnell during these years became evident during <a>Franklin D. Roosevelt's</a> presidency, when Grinnell graduates <a>Harry Hopkins</a> '12, <a>Chester Davis</a> '11, <a>Paul Appleby</a> '13, <a>Hallie Flanagan</a> '11, and <a>Florence Kerr</a> '12 became influential <a>New Deal</a> administrators.
</p>
<p>Concern with social issues, educational innovation, and individual expression continue to shape Grinnell.
As an example, the school&#x2019;s &quot;5th year travel-service program,&quot; preceded the establishment of the <a>Peace Corps</a> by many years.
Other recent innovations include first-year tutorials, cooperative pre-professional programs, and programs in quantitative studies and the societal impacts of technology.</p>
<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
<p>Grinnell's mission statement, as quoted on the college's website:</p>
<p><em>When Grinnell College framed its charter in the Iowa Territory of the United States in 1846, it set forth a mission to educate its students &quot;for the different professions and for the honorable discharge of the duties of life.&quot;
The College pursues that mission by educating young men and women in the liberal arts through free inquiry and the open exchange of ideas.
As a teaching and learning community, the College holds that knowledge is a good to be pursued both for its own sake and for the intellectual, moral, and physical well-being of individuals and of society at large.
The College exists to provide a lively academic community of students and teachers of high scholarly qualifications from diverse social and cultural circumstances.
The College aims to graduate women and men who can think clearly, who can speak and write persuasively and even eloquently, who can evaluate critically both their own and others' ideas, who can acquire new knowledge, and who are prepared in life and work to use their knowledge and their abilities to serve the common good.</em>&lt;ref&gt;[[<a>http://www.grinnell.edu/offices/president/missionstatement</a>]]&lt;/ref&gt;</p>

<h3>Academic program</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|Alumni Recitation Hall</a></p>
<p>The academic program at Grinnell College emphasizes active learning and one-on-one interactions between faculty members and students.
There are few large lecture classes.
In sharp contrast to all <a>public universities</a> and many private universities in the United States, no classes, labs or other courses are taught by <a>graduate student</a>s.
</p>
<p>Grinnell's open curriculum encourages students to take initiative and to assume responsibility for their own courses of study.
The sole <a>core, or general education, requirement</a> is the completion of the First-Year Tutorial, a one-semester, <a>four-credit</a> special topics <a>seminar</a> that stresses methods of inquiry, critical analysis, and writing skills.
All other classes are chosen, with the direct guidance of a faculty member in the student's major department, by the student.</p>
<p>Grinnell College expects all students to possess significant academic achievements.
The curriculum is rigorous and advanced, and no remedial classes are offered.
For example, the math department does not offer any basic-level classes such as college algebra, trigonometry, or pre-calculus.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Mathematics
and Statistics courses offered</a>&lt;/ref&gt;  However, several independent, non-credit programs assist students who need help in a specific subject.
They are the Library Lab, Math Lab, Reading Lab, Science Learning Center, and the Writing Lab.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Links to labs</a>&lt;/ref&gt;  While private tutors can be hired, participation in these programs is free for any enrolled student.</p>
<p>Grinnell has twenty-six major departments and ten interdisciplinary concentrations.
Popular majors include <a>Psychology</a>, <a>Economics</a>, <a>Biology</a>, <a>History</a>, <a>English</a>, and <a>Political Science</a>.
In every division, students have opportunities to conduct original research and undertake advanced study through independent and interdisciplinary projects that foster intellectual discovery.
The minimum requirements in a major area of study are typically limited to 32 credits in a single department, with some departments additionally requiring a small number of classes in related fields that are deemed critical for all students in that field.
For example, the biology program requires 32 credits in the biology department plus two classes in chemistry and one in math.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Biology
major requirements</a>&lt;/ref&gt; Many students exceed the minimum requirements.
</p>
<p>To graduate, students are normally expected to complete at least 32 credits in a major field and a total of 124 credits of academic work.
To encourage students to explore courses outside of their primary interest area, no more than 48 credits in one department and no more than 92 credits in one division are counted towards this requirement.</p>
<p><a>thumb|right|Bucksbaum Rotunda</a> Grinnell&#x2019;s commitment to the importance of off-campus study reflects the school&#x2019;s emphasis on social and political awareness and the international nature of its campus.
Approximately 60 percent of all Grinnell students participate in at least one of more than seventy off-campus programs, including the Grinnell-in-<a>London</a> program and study tours of <a>China</a>, <a>France</a>, <a>Greece</a>, and <a>Russia</a>.
These study programs in <a>Europe</a> (including Russia), <a>Africa</a>, the <a>Near East</a>, and <a>Asia</a>, as well as nine programs in <a>Central</a> and <a>South America</a>, provide the opportunity for research in many disciplines, from archaeology to education to mathematics.
In addition to off-campus programs, Grinnell offers internship programs in such areas as urban studies, art, and marine biology for students interested in field-based learning and experience in professional settings.
Second- and third-year students may apply for summer internship grants and receive credit for the experience.
Semester programs in the United States include those at <a>Oak Ridge National Laboratory</a>, <a>Newberry Library</a>, <a>National Theatre Institute</a>, and Grinnell-in-<a>Washington, D.C</a>.</p>
<p>Grinnell also has invested in several interdisciplinary programs:  the Center for Prairie Studies, Center for the Humanities, Center for International Studies, Noun Program in Women's Studies, Peace Studies Program, Rosenfield Public Affairs Program, and the Donald L. Wilson Program in Enterprise and Leadership.</p>
<p>Despite the growing trend of U.S. students taking five or more years to finish an undergraduate degree, Grinnell College is strongly oriented towards students being enrolled full time in exactly eight consecutive semesters at the college, although exceptions are available for medical issues and other emergencies.&lt;ref&gt;Grinnell
College.
<a>&quot;Academic Catalog: Academic Regulations&quot;</a>&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid being suspended from the college, students must make &quot;normal progress towards graduation.&quot;
This generally means that the student must pass at least 12 credits of classes in each individual semester, with grades of a C or better, and have accumulated enough credits to make graduation possible at the end of four years, which requires an average of 15.5 credits each semester.
A student who is not making normal progress towards graduation is placed on academic probation and may be dismissed from the college.&lt;ref&gt;Grinnell

<p>With the first-year students enrolled in the 2006-2007 school year, Grinnell has ended its <a>need-blind admission</a>s policy for international applicants.
Under the old policy, students from countries outside the U.S. were admitted without any consideration of their ability to afford four years of study at the college.
However, financial aid offers to these students were limited to half the cost of tuition.&lt;ref

Under the new &quot;need-sensitive&quot; or &quot;need-aware&quot; policy, international students whose demonstrated financial needs can be met are given a slight admissions edge over applicants who can't.
The twin hopes are that the enrolled international students will be able to dedicate more energy to their schoolwork, and also that this will ultimately allow the college to provide higher tuition grants to international students.</p>

<h2>Self-governance</h2>
<p>Students at Grinnell adhere to an honor system known as &quot;<a>self-governance</a>&quot; wherein they are expected to govern their own choices and behavior with minimal direct intervention by the college administration.
By cultivating a community based on freedom of choice, self-governance aims to encourage students to become responsible, respectful, and accountable members of the campus, town, and global community.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h2>Endowment</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|Joe Rosenfield '25 Center</a>Grinnell's $1.47 billion endowment as of June 2008 &#x2013; the third-largest among United States liberal arts colleges &#x2013; is evident in the college's facilities, art collections, and generous financial aid programs.&lt;ref

one of many investments that were unprecedented in their time for a college endowment.
Another innovative move that significantly increased the endowment occurred when Rosenfield and the college contributed to the founding of <a>Intel</a>&#x2014;an investment exceeding 10% of the venture capital raised to start the semiconductor company (<a>Intel</a> co-founder <a>Robert Noyce</a> is a Grinnell alumnus).&lt;ref&gt;<a>CNNMoney.com</a>,  <a>Zweig on funds</a>, June 1, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
