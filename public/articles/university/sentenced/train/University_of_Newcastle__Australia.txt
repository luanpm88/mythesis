<h2>History</h2>
<p>The origins of the University of Newcastle can be traced back to the establishment of the Newcastle University College at the Newcastle Technical College site on 3 December 1951.
The college was established under the authority of the then University of Technology New South Wales, which is now known as the <a>University of New South Wales</a>.
At the time of its establishment the Newcastle University College had just five full-time students and study was restricted to engineering, mathematics and science.
</p>
<p>The university became autonomous through the University of Newcastle Act 1964 (NSW) which constituted the university on 1 January 1965 through a Proclamation of His Excellency the <a>Governor of New South Wales</a>.
A document known as the University&#x2019;s Grant of Arms is cited as being its very own Declaration of Independence.</p>
<p>In 1998, the University established a partnership with the Institut Wira, a Malaysian private business school.
In 2002, Ian Firms, a lecturer, failed a large number of student papers from Wira for <a>academic dishonesty</a>, but his actions were reversed by the Newcastle administration and he was discharged.
He then appealed to the New South Wales <a>Independent Commission Against Corruption</a>, which made a finding of corruption against Dr Paul Ryder, a failure by Vice Chancellor Roger Holmes in the execution of his duty and recommended disciplining the Deputy Vice Chancellor, Professor Brian English.
</p>
<p>In 2003, The University of Newcastle, together with five other Australian universities (<a>Macquarie</a>, <a>La Trobe</a>, <a>Flinders</a>, <a>Griffith</a> and <a>Murdoch</a>) established Innovative Research Universities Australia (IRUA).</p>
<p>Forty years after obtaining autonomy, The University of Newcastle has developed a reputed history in their national and international university standings; ranked in the 10-14 range of the 38 universities in Australia by the <a>Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a> and 215th in the world by the <em><a>Times Higher Education Supplement</a></em> in 2007.</p>
<p>The university unveiled a new logo on 31 March 2007 as part of a brand refresh to better align the university's image with the its new strategic direction.</p>
<p>On 11 May 2007, the university launched its new campus at the <a>PSB Academy</a>'s two main campuses in <a>Singapore</a>.</p>
