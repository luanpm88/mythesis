<p>  <strong>Lawrence University</strong> is a top tier, private <a>liberal arts college</a> located in <a>Appleton</a>, <a>Wisconsin</a>.
Founded in 1847, the first classes were held on November 12, 1849.
Lawrence was the second college in the <a>United States</a> to be founded as a <a>coeducational</a> institution.</p>
<p>The 84 acre small campus is located in downtown Appleton, divided into two parts by the Fox River.
The academic campus is on the north shore of Fox River, while the major athletic facilities (including the 5000-seat banta bowl) is on the northeast shore.
Lawrence University also has a  northern estate called <a>Bj&#x00f6;rklunden</a> (full name: Bj&#x00f6;rklunden vid sj&#x00f6;n), which serves as a site for retreats, seminars, concerts, and theatrical performances.
There is also a chapel for weddings.
Donald and Winifred Boynton of <a>Highland Park</a>, <a>Illinois</a>, donated the property in <a>Door County</a> to Lawrence in 1963.</p>
<p>The student newspaper <em><a>The Lawrentian</a></em> has a history of about a century.
Lawrence University is known by many for the <a>Great Midwest Trivia Contest</a> broadcast every January over the college radio station <a>WLFM</a>.
The contest is now exclusively webcast because of WLFM's move away from traditional FM radio broadcast.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Lawrence's first president, <a>William Harkness Sampson</a> founded the school with <a>Henry R. Colman</a>, using $10,000 provided by <a>philanthropist</a> <a>Amos Adams Lawrence</a>, and matched by the <a>Methodist</a> church.
Both founders were ordained Methodist <a>ministers</a>, but Lawrence was <a>Episcopalian</a>.
The school was originally named <strong>Lawrence Institute</strong> in its 1847 charter from the Wisconsin Territorial Legislature, but was changed to Lawrence University before classes began in November 1849.
Its oldest currently-standing building, <a>Main Hall</a>, was built in 1853.
Lawrence University was Wisconsin&#x2019;s first co-educational university and was founded before the state of Wisconsin.
</p>
<p>Lawrence's first period of major growth came during the tenure of <a>alumnus</a> <a>Samuel G. Plantz</a> as president.
From 1894 until 1924, when Plantz presided over the school, its student body grew from 200 to 800.</p>
<p>From 1913 until 1964, the school was named <strong>Lawrence College</strong>, to emphasize its small size and <a>liberal arts</a> education focus.
The name was changed back to Lawrence University when it joined with <a>Milwaukee-Downer College</a>, symbolizing the two schools united as one.
The state of Wisconsin then purchased the Milwaukee-Downer property and buildings to expand the campus of the <a>University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Milwaukee</a>.
Initially, the university designated two entities: Lawrence College for Men and Downer College for Women.
This separation has not lasted in any material form, though degrees are still conferred &quot;on the recommendation of the Faculty of Lawrence and Downer Colleges&quot; and the university by-laws still make the distinction.
The Lawrence Dean of Women was referred to as the &quot;Dean of Downer&quot;, but when the offices of Dean of Men and Dean of Women were merged to form the Dean of Students, the substantive duties of the &quot;Dean of Downer&quot; came to an end; the title is still borne by a senior female professor, but her only duty is to carry the Downer Mace in academic processions.</p>
<p>The Lawrence Conservatory of Music, usually referred to as &quot;the Con&quot;, was founded in 1894.
The university confers a <a>Bachelor of Music</a> degree and also offers a five-year program leading to a <a>Bachelor of Arts</a> in addition to the <a>music</a> degree.</p>
<p>Lawrence University is distinguished by originating the idea of <a>freshman studies</a>.
Freshman Studies at Lawrence is a mandatory two term class, in which all students study the same selected 11 classic works of literature, art, and music.
President <a>Nathan M. Pusey</a> is credited with initiating the program in 1945, although Professor Waples chaired the Freshman Studies Committee and was responsible for actually implementing the program.
The program continues to this day, despite being temporarily suspended in 1974, and has been adapted by many liberal arts colleges.</p>
<p>Lawrence is included in <a>Loren Pope</a>'s, <em><a>Colleges That Change Lives</a></em></p>
<p>In 2010, <a>Forbes</a> ranked Lawrence 50th on the list of America's (600) Best Colleges, which combined national research universities, liberal arts colleges, and military academies in a single survey Lawrence is ranked 67th on the list of U.S.News Best U.S. national liberal arts colleges (the rank was 40 in 2000, 53 in 2006 and 59 in 2009).</p>
<p>Several years ago Lawrence has raised a capital campaign called &quot;More Light!&quot;, which aims at raising a total fund of $150 million.
By now the college has raised $137 millions, and the event will conclude in October 2011.</p>
<h2>Milwaukee-Downer traditions</h2>
<p>[[File:Lawrence University.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The
cupola on [[Main Hall (Lawrence University)|Main Hall]] at Lawrence University is an Appleton landmark.]]
The <a>traditions</a> and heritage of Milwaukee-Downer are woven into the Appleton campus, from the grove of <a>hawthorn</a> trees (called Hawthornden) between Brokaw and Colman halls, to the <a>sundial</a> on the back of <a>Main Hall</a>, to the bestowing upon each class a class color and banner.
</p>
<p>When the University had separate offices for a &quot;Dean of Women&quot; and a &quot;Dean of Men&quot;, the officer overseeing women students was called the &quot;Dean of Downer.&quot;
That title is still borne by the senior woman on the faculty, but her only duty now is carrying the Downer mace in academic processions.
For many years the women's choir was called the Downer Chorus.
At one time the BA was conferred upon women in the name of &quot;Downer College of Lawrence University&quot; and upon men in the name of &quot;Lawrence College of Lawrence University&quot;; now all B.A. degrees are conferred in the name of &quot;Lawrence &amp; Downer Colleges of Lawrence University.&quot;
(The B.Mus. degree is from &quot;the Lawrence University Conservatory of Music.)</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|250px|Seeley G. Mudd Library.
The library contains nearly 400,000 books.</a>
Lawrence University operates on a <a>trimester</a> calendar.
The academic year runs from mid-September to mid-June.</p>
<p>The student/faculty ratio at Lawrence is 9:1, much lower than the national average.
</p>
<p>Lawrence grants Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Music degrees.
A <a>double degree</a> is possible and double degree students are not uncommon.
Lawrence offers a number of cooperative degree programs in areas such as <a>engineering</a>, <a>health sciences</a> and <a>environmental studies</a>.</p>
<p>The college has major programs in most areas of the <a>liberal arts</a>.
The school also offers the option of <a>interdisciplinary</a> areas of study and allows students to create their own majors.
All students are required to take Freshman Studies, which introduces students to broad areas of study and provides a common academic experience for the college.</p>
<p>The school has an independent study option that allows students to design their own courses.
This allows students to explore academic interests not covered by Lawrence&#x2019;s classes or to explore topics more deeply.
Over 90% of the students take advantage of the independent study program.</p>
<p>In 2005, Lawrence University began the Lawrence Fellows Program, initially selecting eight recent Ph.D.s to teach and carry out research at Lawrence for a period of two to three years.
This program seeks to develop the liberal arts professoriate of the future.</p>
<p>The physics department of Lawrence is one of the most notable small science departments in U.S. Liberal Arts Colleges.
In the mid-1980s the physics department built a $330,000 small laser laboratory (known as the &quot;laser palace&quot;), which include 800 5mW small lasers and more than 500 mirrors.</p>
<h2>Razed buildings</h2>
<p>The college has a long history of razing buildings on its campus, because of the limited land available for constructing new buildings.
Many buildings on campus are built on the site of former buildings.
Some razed buildings include: Peabody Hall of Music (20th century), Hamar Union (1960) Underwood Observatory (1962), Alexander Gym I (1962), Carnegie Library (1964), Worcester Art Center (1987), Stephenson Hall of Science (1998), Hulbert House (2004),</p>
<h2>Student body</h2>
<p>Lawrence enrolls about 1,500 students who hail from nearly every U.S. state, though the majority of them are from <a>Wisconsin</a> and other <a>Midwestern</a> states.
The total enrollment in academic year 2010-2011 is 1,495 students, the largest student body in Lawrence University's history.
Over 75% of the students identify as white.
About 12% of the students are <a>international student</a>s.
About 25% of students study in the conservatory of music.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p> In 2005-06, the Lawrence men's basketball team was ranked number one in <a>NCAA</a> <a>Division III</a> for much of the season, after starting the season unranked.
The team was the only undefeated team in all divisions of college basketball for the last six weeks of the season, ending up with a record of 25-1.
Star forward Chris Braier won the <a>Josten's Award</a> as the top player in the country for both playing ability and community service.
Coach John Tharp was named Division III Midwest Coach of the Year.
Excitement among fans caused attendance to increase to capacity for home games, causing local fire officials to demand that Lawrence cap attendance for the NCAA tournament games that Lawrence would host.
The university decided to issue passes to attendees.
Following their win of the Midwest Conference Tournament in 2009, the Vikings have qualified for the NCAA Division III National Tournament in five of the last six years.
Their best finish was in 2004 when they lost in the Elite 8 to eventual national champion <a>University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Stevens Point</a> 82-81 in overtime at the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma, Wash.</p>
