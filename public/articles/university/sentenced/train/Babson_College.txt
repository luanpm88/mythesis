<p><strong>Babson College</strong> is a private <a>business school</a> located in <a>Wellesley, Massachusetts</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Babson College was founded by <a>Roger Babson</a> on September 3, 1919, as the Babson Institute.
It was renamed &quot;Babson College&quot; in 1969.
Believing experience to be the best teacher, Roger Babson favored a curriculum that was a combination of both class work and business training: businessmen made up the majority of the faculty instead of <a>academic</a>s, and the institute's curriculum focused more on practical experience and less on lectures.</p>
<p>Students worked on group projects and class presentations, observed manufacturing processes during field trips to area factories and businesses, met with managers and executives, and viewed industrial films on Saturday mornings.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>Babson offers all undergraduates a <a>bachelor of science</a> degree in business management while the <a>F.
W. Olin</a> Graduate School of Business at Babson College offers <a>MBA</a> degrees.
Programs are accredited by <a>Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business</a> (AACSB) and the college itself has been regionally accredited by the <a>New England Association of Schools and Colleges</a> (NEASC) since 1950.</p>
<h3>Rankings</h3>
<p>In 2010, <em><a>Bloomberg Businessweek</a></em> ranked Babson's undergraduate program #17 overall in the country, as well as giving Babson the second-most, tied with <a>Cornell University</a>, top-10 specialty rankings among leading undergraduate business programs.</p>
<p>Babson&#x2019;s MBA program has been ranked #1 in entrepreneurship for 17 consecutive years by <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></em>, and is ranked #39 overall in the Bloomberg Businessweek 2010 rankings.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|The Babson Globe</a> The campus is  in the &quot;Babson Park&quot; section of <a>Wellesley, Massachusetts</a>.
The 25-ton,  Babson Globe is a notable campus landmark.
Built in 1955 by <a>Roger Babson</a> at a cost of $200,000, it originally rotated both on its axis and its base, demonstrating both day and night and the progression of the seasons.
It was allowed to deteriorate; the facing tiles fell off in 1984, and by 1988 it had the appearance of a rusty sphere.
The Babson administration announced that it would be destroyed, but outraged students, faculty and alumni began a drive to raise money for its restoration.
In 1994 the globe itself was refurbished, though it no longer rotates.
It was for many years the largest rotating globe in the world and remains one of the largest ever built.

<h2>Student life</h2>
<p>In 2008, there were a total of 3,439 students attending Babson, 1,851 of whom were <a>undergraduate</a>s.

</p>
<p>Babson's <a>athletic nickname</a> is the &quot;Beavers&quot; and its colors are green and white.
Babson has twenty-two <a>varsity sports</a> teams, the majority of which compete in the New England Women's and Men's Athletic Conference (NEWMAC) as <a>NCAA Division III</a>.
In addition, the men's and women's alpine ski teams compete in the United States Collegiate Ski &amp; Snowboard Association (USCSA), the men's ice hockey team competes in the <a>Eastern College Athletic Conference</a> (ECAC), and the men's lacrosse team competes in the Pilgrim League.
The only team that does not compete in a specific conference is the golf program, which competed in the NEWMAC until 2005, when the conference ceased sponsorship of the sport due to lack of participating teams.</p>
