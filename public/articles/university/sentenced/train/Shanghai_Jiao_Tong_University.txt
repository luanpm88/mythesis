<p><strong>Shanghai Jiao Tong University</strong> (; abbreviated <strong>Shanghai Jiao Da</strong> (&#x4e0a;&#x6d77;&#x4ea4;&#x5927;) or <strong>SJTU</strong>), sometimes referred to as <strong>Shanghai Jiaotong University</strong> (no space), is a top public research university located in <a>Shanghai</a>, <a>China</a>.
Shanghai Jiao Tong University is known as one of the oldest and most prestigious universities in <a>China</a>.
It is also a member of the <a>C9 League</a> in China.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|200px|left|Nanyang Public School</a>     In 1896, <strong>Nanyang Public School</strong> was founded in <a>Shanghai</a> by an imperial edict issued by <a>Guangxu Emperor</a>, under the Business and Telegraphs Office of the <a>imperial government</a>.
Four schools were established: the <a>normal school</a>, school of foreign studies,  middle school and a high school.
<a>Sheng Xuanhuai</a>, the proposer of the edict, became the first president and was regarded as the founder of the university.</p>
<p>In 1904, the Ministry of Commerce took over the school, and one year later changed its name to <strong>Imperial Polytechnic College of the Commerce Ministry</strong>.
In 1906, the college was placed under the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs, and its name was changed to <strong>Shanghai Industrial College of the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs</strong>.
When the <a>Republic of China</a> was founded, the college was run by the Ministry of Communications and its name was once again changed, this time to <strong>Government Institute of Technology of the Communications Ministry</strong>.
In 1918, the republic government founded the School of Management and it became one of the oldest academic institutes.</p>
<p>&lt;!--<a>thumb|250px|right|The Upper College building in 1920, Xuhui campus</a>--&gt; In 1920, the institute merged with two other colleges and changed its name to <strong>Nan Yang College of Chiao Tung</strong>.
In the 1930s, it was known as the &quot;Eastern <a>MIT</a>&quot; due to its reputation of nurturing top engineers.
In 1938, the Ministry of Education took over the university and renamed it <strong>National Chiao Tung University</strong> (the separate institution of <a>National Chiao Tung University</a> in <a>Taiwan</a>, is still known by name).
In 1943, the graduate school was founded.</p>
<p>After the <a>Chinese Civil War</a> in 1949, the new Communist government adopted a policy of creating Soviet-style <a>specialized school</a>s.
Under this policy, some faculties of the university were incorporated into other universities.
At the same time, engineering faculties from outside were absorbed to create a specialized engineering university.
A bigger rearrangement came in 1956 for the school when the national government decided to send a significant amount of its faculties to <a>Xi'an</a> to help create another top engineering school - <a>Xi'an Jiaotong University</a> in western Chinese province Shaanxi.
Afterwards, the school was officially renamed <strong>Shanghai Jiao Tong University</strong>. </p>
<p><a>Shanghai Second Medical University</a> was merged into Shanghai Jiao Tong University on July 18, 2005, under the name <strong>Medical School of Shanghai Jiao Tong University</strong>.</p>
<h2>Present</h2>
<p><a>thumb|200px|right|The Gate of Xuhui Campus</a> At present, the university comprises 20 academic schools, two directly affiliated departments and one <a>graduate school</a>.
It also has a School of Continuing (adult) Education, School of <a>Online Learning</a>, School of International Education, and a <a>Vocational School</a>.

Its total enrollment of full-time students amounts over 38,000.
There are 19,432 undergraduates, 13,628 candidates for Master's Degree and Doctor's Degree and 2,080 foreign students.</p>
<p><a>280px|left|thumb|School of Mechanical Engineering, Minhang Campus</a> The university has more than 1,420 professors and associate professors, including 15 academicians of the <a>Chinese Academy of Sciences</a>, 20 academicians of the <a>Chinese Academy of Engineering</a>, seven chief scientists of the national 973 project and 31 &quot;Cheung Kong Scholars&quot;.</p>
<h2>Academic Ranking of World Universities</h2>
<p>Since 2003, Shanghai Jiao Tong University has produced the <a>Academic Ranking of World Universities</a> which analyzes the top universities in the world on quality of faculty (40%), research output (40%), quality of education (10%) and performance vs. size (10%).
Its ranking is exclusively of research universities, mainly in the empirical sciences.The actual ranking is in the pipeline.</p>

<h2>Campuses</h2>
<h3>Xuhui Campus</h3>
<p><a>200px|left|thumb|A scene of the original library, Xuhui campus</a> The previous main campus was located in <a>Xuhui District</a> of Shanghai, formerly a largely <a>Catholic</a> area and a site of several educational institutions.</p>
<p>Most buildings on campus were influenced by American architecture, while the main gate, which was built in 1935, is of traditional Chinese style reflecting the University's earlier status as the &quot;Imperial Polytechnic College&quot;.
The approaches to the main gate were via a series of marble bridges, similar to, although smaller than, those built in front of <a>Tiananmen</a>.
However, recent road expansions have demolished the river as well as most of bridges.
A copy of this famous gate scene have been built on the east of Minhang campus.
</p>
<p>The construction of the campus never came to an end in the past century.
Existing buildings: the Medium College building(built in 1898), the original library (built in 1919), the gymnasium (built in 1925), the administrative building (built in 1933), the Xinjian building (built in 1953), the new Upper College building (built in 1955), the second teaching building (built in 1960), Bao Zhaolong library (built in 1985) and Haoran high-tech building (built in 1996) were constructed one after another.</p>
<p>The university's School of International Education is located here, where a large number of international students take classes throughout the academic year (however, most international students that take degree courses are in Minhang campus).
The campus still houses a variety of scientific research institutions, <a>State Key Laboratory of Ocean Engineering</a> for instance, although most moved to the new campus since 1987.</p>
<h3>Minhang Campus</h3>
<p><a>280px|right|thumb|The Siyuan Lake, Minhang Campus</a> The Minhang campus is located in the <a>Minhang District</a> on the outskirts of metropolitan <a>Shanghai</a>.
This young campus, which was founded in 1987, covers 2,822,903m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; once farmland.
Zizhu Science Park, where <a>Intel</a>, <a>ST Microelectronics</a>, <a>Microsoft</a> and other high-tech companies put their <a>research and development</a> centers, is to the south of the campus.</p>
<p>Currently, most administrative and academic framework of the university and the majority of undergraduate and graduate students have situated in this campus, which is now accompanied by the newly built Minhang Campus of <a>East China Normal University</a>.</p>
<h3>South Chongqing Road Campus</h3>
<p>It is formerly the campus of <a>Shanghai Second Medical University</a>, which is located in the <a>Luwan District</a> of Shanghai.
The <a>Aurora University (Shanghai)</a>, a pre-eminent Catholic university in Shanghai, was located there before 1952.</p>
<h3>Qibao Campus</h3>
<p>In 1999, Shanghai Agricultural College was merged into SJTU, and its campus became Qibao Campus of the university.
It's located in 2678 Qixin Rd.
Postal code is 201101.</p>
<h3>Shangzhong Road Campus</h3>
<p>In the year of 2006, Shanghai Jiao Tong University sold this campus to <a>Shanghai High School</a>.</p>
<h3>Fahuazhen Road Campus</h3>
<p>This campus is where Jiao Tong's Antai College of Economics and Management is located.</p>
