<p> The <strong>University of Oregon</strong> (UO) is a <a>public</a>, <a>coeducation</a>al <a>research university</a> in <a>Eugene, Oregon</a>, <a>United States</a>.
The second-oldest public university in the state, UO was founded in 1876 and graduated its first class two years later.
The University of Oregon is one of sixty members of the <a>Association of American Universities</a>.
The <a>Carnegie Foundation</a> classifies the University of Oregon as a &quot;high research activity&quot; university.
<a>Richard W. Lariviere</a> is the current president of the university.
The University of Oregon receives much of its funding from the UO Foundation, an independent not-for-profit organization.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The <a>Oregon State Legislature</a> established the university on October 12, 1872 despite funding woes.
The residents of Eugene struggled to help finance the institution, holding numerous fundraising events such as strawberry festivals, church socials, and produce sales.
The doors officially opened in 1876, with <a>Deady Hall</a> its sole building.
The first year of enrollment contained 155 students taught by five faculty members.
The first graduating class was in 1878, graduating five students.</p>
<p>The Zorn-MacPherson Bill in 1932 proposed that the University of Oregon and <a>Oregon State College</a> (now &quot;University&quot;), to be merged into one university.
The bill lost in a landslide vote of over 6 to 1.
The University of Oregon Medical School, originally founded in 1887 in Portland and merged with <a>Willamette University</a>'s program in 1913, officially became an independent institution in 1974 known as <a>Oregon Health Sciences University</a>.</p>
<p>With financial support from the state dwindling from 40% to 13% of the university budget, in January 2001, University President <a>Dave Frohnmayer</a> began Campaign Oregon with the goal of raising $600 million by December 2008, the greatest philanthropic fundraising campaign in the history of the state of Oregon.
With total contributions exceeding $100 million from benefactors such as <a>Phil Knight</a> and <a>Lorry I. Lokey</a>, the campaign goal was exceeded by over $253 million.</p>
<p><a>Richard W. Lariviere</a> is the current president of the university.
He was a former provost at the <a>University of Kansas</a> and replaced <a>David B. Frohnmayer</a> on July 1, 2009.
Lariviere received a salary of $414,397 in 2009.</p>

<p>The Charles H. Lundquist College of Business (LCB) was founded in 1884 and offers courses in fields such as accounting, decision sciences, entrepreneurship, finance, management, and marketing.
It is also home to the <a>University of Oregon Investment Group</a> and the Warsaw Sports Marketing Center, one of the first programs to offer an M.B.A. in sports business and is noted as having the best sports business and marketing programs in the nation.
Each year, the college's Lundquist Center for Entrepreneurship presents the <a>New Venture Championship</a>, a business plan competition for graduate students that draws competitors from all over the world.
The College is housed in the <a>Lillis Business Complex</a>.
The college's current dean is Cornelis A. &#x201c;Kees&#x201d; de Kluyver, who is himself an alumnus, having earned a bachelor&#x2019;s degree in marketing and a master of business administration degree from the University of Oregon.
Dean de Kluyver assumed his duties on September 1, 2010, taking over from Dennis Howard, who completed a two-year appointment.
According to the U.S. News &amp; World Report 2009 edition of &quot;America&#x2019;s Best Graduate Schools,&quot; the College of Education ranked 4th overall and 1st among public universities.
For the 4th consecutive year, the UO special education program ranked third in the nation.
Admitted students in 2005 held a mean unweighted GPA of 3.93 and a mean SAT score of 1355 (out of 1600).</p>
<h4>School of Journalism and Communication</h4>
<p>The <a>School of Journalism and Communication</a> is one of the oldest journalism schools in the United States, beginning as a department in 1912 and later becoming a professional school 1916, receiving accreditation from the <a>Accrediting Council for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication</a>.
It currently runs the Oregon Documentary Project and <em><a>Flux</a></em> magazine, a student-produced publication.
Eight of the nine <a>Pulitzer Prize</a> winners from the University of Oregon graduated from the School of Journalism and Communication.
It also awards the annual <a>Payne Award for Ethics in Journalism</a>.</p>

The <a>Knight Library</a> can be seen in the distance.]]
The multi-branch University of Oregon Libraries serves the campus with library collections, instruction and reference, and a wide variety of educational technology and media services.
The UO is Oregon's only member of the <a>Association of Research Libraries</a>.
The main branch, <a>Knight Library</a>, houses humanities and social sciences, Learning Commons, Music Services, Government Publications, Maps and Aerial Photos, Special Collections &amp; University Archives, Media Services, the Center for Educational Technologies, and a Cinema Studies lab to be available in Winter 2010.
Other branch locations are the Architecture and Allied Arts Library, the John E. Jaqua Law Library, the Science Library, the Mathematics Library, the Portland Library &amp; Learning Commons, and the Loyd &amp; Dorothy Rippey Library at the <a>Oregon Institute of Marine Biology</a>.</p>
<p>The UO Libraries hosts Scholars' Bank, an <a>open access</a> (OA) digital repository created to capture, distribute and preserve the intellectual output of the University of Oregon.
Scholars' Bank uses the open-source <a>DSpace</a> software developed by <a>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> and <a>Hewlett-Packard</a>.</p>
<p>The Libraries' Educational Video Group maintains the UO Channel, which uses streaming media to provide access to campus lectures, interviews, performances, symposia, and documentary productions.</p>
<p>The UO is the founding member and host of the <a>Orbis-Cascade Alliance</a>, a consortium of academic and research libraries in Oregon and Washington.
The combined collections of the Alliance exceed 20 million volumes and can be searched via the Summit union catalog.</p>
<h3>Oregon Bach Festival</h3>
<p>The UO is the home of the <a>Oregon Bach Festival</a>, a donor-supported program of the University.
Founded in 1970 by German conductor <a>Helmuth Rilling</a> and UO professor (and past president of the <a>American Choral Directors Association</a>) Royce Saltzman, the festival has grown into an international program that draws hundreds of musicians and over 30,000 attendees annually.
The festival's focus is choral and orchestral music, and it hosts a professional choir and orchestra each year to perform major works by <a>Bach</a> and other composers; it also sponsors a master class that draws participants from around the world.</p>
<p>The festival has also presented such artists as <a>Frederica von Stade</a>, <a>Bobby McFerrin</a>, <a>Garrison Keillor</a>, and <a>Thomas Quasthoff</a>, who made his American debut in Eugene in 1995.
The festival actively commissions and premieres new choral-orchestra works, including pieces by <a>Arvo P&#x00e4;rt</a>, <a>Osvaldo Golijov</a>, and <a>Tan Dun</a>.
A Bach Festival recording of the world-premiere performance of <a>Krzyztof Penderecki</a>'s <em>Credo</em> won the 2001 <a>Grammy Award</a> for best choral performance.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p></p>
<p><a>thumb|right|Campus trees.</a>
The campus is spread over  and holds sixty major buildings, as well as providing a home for more than 500 varieties of trees.
Eugene is located near many prominent geographic features such as the <a>Willamette River</a>, <a>Cascade Mountains</a> and the <a>Pacific Ocean</a>.
Also within a two-hour drive is the <a>Portland</a> metropolitan area.</p>
<p>Based on Ellis F. Lawrence's vision, many of the University's buildings are planned around several major quadrangles, many of which abut the 13th Avenue pedestrian mall.
The university is known for being the site of a pioneering participatory planning experiment known as the <a>Oregon Experiment</a>, which is also the subject of a book of the same name that evolved into the well known book <em><a>A Pattern Language</a></em> by <a>Christopher Alexander</a>.
The two major principles of the project are that buildings should be designed, in part, by the people who will ultimately use them with the help of an &quot;architect facilitator&quot;, and that construction should occur over many small projects as opposed to a few large ones.</p>
<p>Although academic buildings are spread throughout the campus, the majority are located along East 13th Avenue, with heavy pedestrian traffic at the intersection with Kincaid Street.
Student recreation and union centers are located toward the center of the campus, with residence halls on the east side of campus.
Sports facilities are grouped in the southern-central part of campus with the <a>Autzen Stadium</a> complex across the Willamette River.
The university also owns and/or operates several satellite facilities, including a large facility in the White Stag Block of downtown Portland.</p>
<p>There has also been a push for sustainable buildings on campus with a development plan that requires any new building or renovation to incorporate sustainable design.
The <a>Lillis Business Complex</a> was the catalyst for the policy.
The building, completed in 2003 has earned a LEED Silver rating, the highest rating of any college business building in the United States.</p>
<h3>Old campus and memorial quad</h3>
<p><a>left|thumb|Deady Hall</a></p>
<p>The oldest section of campus is located in the northwest area of the current campus.
The university&#x2019;s first building, <a>Deady Hall</a>, opened on October 16, 1876, when the University had an enrollment of 177 students.
It was originally known as &#x201c;the building&#x201d; before being named after Judge Matthew Deady in 1893.
The second building on campus is known as <a>Villard Hall</a> and is home to the Theater Arts and Comparative Literature Departments.
Completed in 1886, the hall was named after railroad magnate <a>Henry Villard</a>, who provided financial aid to the university in 1881.
Before its naming, it was known as &#x201c;the new building.&#x201d;
Both Deady and Villard Halls were designated <a>National Historic Landmark</a>s in 1977.</p>
<p>Just south of Old Campus is the Memorial Quad, which runs north and south along Kincaid Street, capped at both ends by the main campus library, <a>Knight Library</a>, on the south side, and the <a>Lillis Business Complex</a> on the north.
It is flanked on the west by the tallest building on campus, <a>Prince Lucien Campbell Hall</a>, also known as &#x201c;PLC,&#x201d; and the <a>Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art</a> on the east, which was remodeled and reopened on January 23, 2005.
Also adjacent to Memorial Quad is Chapman Hall, which houses the <a>Robert D. Clark Honors College</a> on its third floor.</p>
<h3>Central campus</h3>
<p><a>left|thumb|Johnson Hall</a> The center of campus houses a mixture of academic buildings, an administration building, and student recreation buildings.
Just to the east of Memorial Quad, facing 13th Avenue is Johnson Hall where offices for higher administration and trustee offices are found, including the offices of the University President.
Directly across 13th Avenue, facing Johnson Hall is the Pioneer statue, a likeness of a bearded, buckskin-clad pioneer cast in bronze by sculptor <a>Alexander Phimister Proctor</a> in 1919.
In 1932, Proctor's &quot;Pioneer Mother&quot; statue was dedicated in the Women's Memorial Quadrangle on the other side of Johnson Hall; the two statues are aligned so that they can &quot;see&quot; one another through the large windows of the hall's main floor.</p>
<p>Lawrence hall is located at the end of hardscape walkway, directly north of the intersection of 13th Avenue and University Street.
It houses the School of Architecture and Allied Arts and is named after its first Dean, <a>Ellis F. Lawrence</a> in 1957.
Allen Hall, opened in 1954, is located adjacent to Lawrence Hall and houses the School of Journalism and Communication.</p>
<p>The Erb Memorial Union is the <a>student union</a>, which provides many various student life amenities and sits on the southeast corner of 13th and University.
It contains a food court, restaurants and cafes, a post office, student groups, meeting rooms and performance spaces, the campus radio station 88.1 <a>KWVA</a>, and offices for administration.</p>
<p>South of the Erb Memorial Union across a small quad is the Student Recreational Center which is an exercise and recreation facility.
It includes fitness equipment, rock climbing walls, a swimming pool, racquetball courts, an indoor elevated running track and basketball courts.
Covered tennis courts and several turf fields, and outdoor tennis courts within a running track are located near the recreation center.</p>
<h3>Lorry I. Lokey Science Complex and east campus</h3>
<p><a>thumb|Willamette Hall, the centerpiece of the Lokey Science Complex</a>The Lokey I. Lokey Science Complex comprises multiple science buildings to the east of Lawrence Hall, on the north side of 13th Avenue.
Willamette Hall's <a>Paul Olum</a> Atrium is the center of the university's hard sciences complex.
The construction of the $45.6 million additions of Willamette, Cascade, and Streisinger Halls to the complex was completed in 1989.
Within the Lokey Science Complex are two facilities focused on integrative science.
One is the <a>Lokey Laboratories</a>, which is a shared-use facility with state-of-the-art characterization instrumentation.
Lokey Laboratories is associated with the <a>Oregon Nanoscience and Microtechnologies Institute (ONAMI)</a> and was dedicated to <a>Lorry I. Lokey</a> on February 19, 2008 for his $25 million donation toward the project.
It is located underground to minimize vibrations, beneath the quad between Heustis and Deschutes Halls.
The other is the <a>Lewis Integrative Science Building</a>, which is currently under construction and is slated for completion by fall 2012.
</p>
<p>East campus is the primary location for residence halls on campus.
However, the north edge of east campus is the future home of the Alumni Center and the new basketball arena.
At the north edge adjacent to the Lokey Science Complex is Oregon Hall, which houses administrative offices including the Office of the Registrar and Office of Admissions.</p>
<p>Carson Hall, located near the Erb Memorial Union, provides dining services along with dormitories.
Just south is the Living-Learning Center, opened in 2006.
It is a collection of functions including dormitories, classrooms, study areas, dining rooms, and recreational rooms to provide a single location for many student activities.</p>
<h3>South campus</h3>
<p>The center of south campus is where much of the on-campus athletic facilities reside.
<a>McArthur Court</a>, the home of the Ducks basketball team, sits just south of the Recreation Center.
<a>Hayward Field</a>, home to the Ducks track and field program, sits in the eastern area of the athletic facilities.
It has hosted a number of prominent track and field events such as the US Track and Field Olympic Trials, the NCAA Track and Field Championships, and <a>USATF</a> Championships.</p>
<p>To the west of the athletic facilities lies Pioneer Cemetery and further west is where the current facilities for the College of Education exists, in the southwest corner of campus.
The Education Annex and the Frohnmayer Music Center in the vicinity are expected to be completed in 2008.
The <a>Knight Law Center</a> is located just opposite of Hayward Field in the southeast corner of campus.
Also in the area are the Many Nations Longhouse and the Museum of Natural and Cultural History.</p>
<h3>Other areas and satellites</h3>
<p>The controversial Riverfront Research Park is a small facility maintained by the university, located across Franklin Boulevard from the main campus, next to the Willamette River.
The park is used for creating new technologies, such as research about artificial intelligence at the Computational Intelligence Research Lab, and it is the home of the <a>Zebrafish Information Network</a> (ZFIN), the <a>zebrafish</a> <a>model organism</a> database.
Local controversy has existed since before the development and approval of the site master plan by the City of Eugene in 1989.
Controversy stems from the lack of citizen involvement in the planning process for the use of public lands, and the potential for multi-story office buildings and parking lots to replace open space, civic space, and wildlife habitat along the Willamette River.
The University and Student Senates have each passed resolutions  against construction on the banks of the Willamette River under the current development plan, yet plans for development persist.
In March 2010, the issue of a conditional use permit extension for the Research Park was appealed to the Land Use Board of Appeals by a group of citizens, students, and faculty.</p>
<p>The complex for the Ducks football and baseball team is located north across the Willamette River.
It includes the football stadium (<a>Autzen Stadium</a>),the baseball park (<a>PK Park</a>), an indoor practice football field (Moshofsky Center), an outdoor practice field (Kilkenny Field), and the Casanova Center which includes offices, the athletics Hall of Fame, locker rooms, weight rooms, a film review theater, and a treatment center.</p>
<p>The university also leases space in Old Town Portland in the White Stag Block.
UO-Portland provides an urban study environment for the School of Architecture and Allied Arts, the School of Journalism and Communication, the School of Law, and the Lundquist College of Business.
Additionally, the Division of Continuing Education, the Labor Education Resource Center, and the Department of Athletics have active offices there.
The <a>Duck Store</a> has an outlet in the building.</p>
<h2>University media</h2>
<p></p>
<p>The University of Oregon has a diverse array of student-run and student-created media, including the <em><a>Oregon Daily Emerald</a></em>, the <em>Oregon Voice</em>, the <em>Oregon Commentator</em>, the <em>Insurgent</em>, &quot;<a>Ethos Magazine</a>&quot;, &quot;Global Talk,&quot; and the &quot;Comic Press.&quot;</p>
<p>The University is also home of two radio stations: <a>KWAX</a> and <a>KWVA</a>.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p></p>
<p>The University of Oregon is a member of the <a>Pacific-10 Conference</a> and the <a>Division I</a> Football Bowl Subdivision of the <a>NCAA</a>.
The athletic programs have garnered 14 NCAA team championships, as well as 60 NCAA individual champions in various track and field events.
The two primary rivals of the <a>Oregon Ducks football</a> team are the <a>Washington Huskies</a> and the <a>Oregon State Beavers</a>.
The football rivalry with <a>Oregon State University</a>, known as the &quot;<a>Civil War</a>&quot;, is one of the nation's oldest.
Every year, the two teams face off in the last game of the regular season.
The two teams have faced each other nearly every year since 1894 with the exception of five years.
Games were not held in 1900, 1901, 1911, 1943, and 1944.</p>
<p>The university competes in 14 sports: football, men&#x2019;s and women&#x2019;s basketball, cross country, track and field, baseball, softball, men&#x2019;s and women&#x2019;s tennis, men&#x2019;s and women&#x2019;s golf, women&#x2019;s soccer, women&#x2019;s lacrosse, women&#x2019;s volleyball, and team stunts and gymnastics.
This does not include club sports which competes at the Division I level in Rugby, Soccer, Rowing, and Waterpolo.
As well as women's Division I club athletics in Rowing, Rugby, and Waterpolo.</p>
<p><a>right|thumb|175px|<em>UO Athletics Logo</em></a>With 12 NCAA championships between them, cross country and track and field are the two programs at the university that have enjoyed the most success.
The programs have produced many world-class athletes including <a>Steve Prefontaine</a> and <a>Alberto Salazar</a>.
<a>Nike</a> had been formed by the former track and field head coach <a>Bill Bowerman</a> and former University of Oregon track runner <a>Phil Knight</a>.
The successes of the programs have given the name of Track Town, USA to Eugene.</p>
<p>Created in 1893, the football team played its first game in 1894 and won its first <a>Rose Bowl</a> in 1917 against the <a>University of Pennsylvania</a>.
The 1938-39 men's basketball team, nicknamed the &#x201c;Tall Firs,&#x201d; won the first-ever NCAA basketball tournament by defeating <a>Ohio State</a> in the March 28, 1939 championship game.</p>
<p>Originally recognized as an official sport at the university in 1908, baseball was disbanded in 1981 due to concerns with <a>Title IX</a>.
In 2007, the athletic director <a>Patrick Kilkenny</a> announced plans to reinstate baseball and to drop wrestling while adding women&#x2019;s competitive cheer.</p>
<p>The mascot of the University of Oregon is the fighting duck.
The popular <a>Disney</a> character <a>Donald Duck</a> has been the mascot for decades, thanks to a handshake agreement made between then-Athletic Director <a>Leo Harris</a> and <a>Walt Disney</a> in 1947.
The mascot has been challenged more than a few times in its lifetime.
The first came in 1966 when Walt Disney died and the company realized there was no formal contract written for the use of Donald&#x2019;s image.
A formal contract was written up in 1973.
but both were unpopular and discontinued.</p>
<p>The <a>fight song</a> is &#x2018;&#x2019;<a>Mighty Oregon</a>,&quot; written by student Albert Perfect and professor John DeWitt Gilbert in 1916.
It has undergone several changes since its original performance.</p>
<h2>Academic co-curriculars</h2>
<p></p>
<h3>ASUO</h3>
<p>[[File:Asuo.JPG|thumb|right|[[Associated Students of the University of Oregon (ASUO)|ASUO]] Window Sign, EMU Suite 4]] The <a>Associated Students of the University of Oregon (ASUO)</a> is the <a>student government</a> at the University of Oregon.
It is a non-profit organization funded by the University of Oregon.
Its purpose is to provide for the <a>social</a>, <a>cultural</a>, <a>education</a>al and <a>physical</a> development of its members, and for the advancement of their individual and collective interests both within and without the University.
The ASUO is the <a>student government</a> and is run by students for students and works on <a>campus</a>, <a>city</a>, <a>state</a>, and <a>federal</a>-level <a>campaign</a>s.
Membership consists of all students at the University of Oregon, <a>Eugene, Oregon</a>, who have paid the current term or <a>semester</a> student incidental fee.</p>
<h3>EMU Board of Directors</h3>
<p>The Erb Memorial Union <a>Board of Directors</a> is responsible for making general policy decisions and long-range plans for the operation of the EMU.
The board allocates the EMU's multi-million dollar <a>budget</a>, assigns space for student groups and advises staff in the <a>management</a> of the EMU.
The sixteen-member <a>Board</a> consists of twelve students (seven elected in a campus-wide election and five direct appointments from either EMU programs or the ASUO), three faculty members appointed by the University of Oregon President and one EMU staff member elected by their peers.</p>
<p>Every fiscal year, the EMU Board prepares a benchmark increase to the ASUO Senate for approval.
After the benchmark process, the EMU presents its final budget to the Senate, requesting a decrease, increase, or no change in Incidental Fees to be allocated to the EMU.
If the budget request is approved, the budget must be signed by the ASUO President and then the UO President.
Unlike the budget process, any general policy decisions by the EMU Board do not require Senate oversight or approval.</p>
<h3>Forensics</h3>
<p>In addition to its athletic teams, the university also has a competitive intercollegiate <a>Speech</a> and <a>Debate</a> team.
The University of Oregon Forensics program was founded in 1876, at the same time as the university.
Initially the program consisted of two student-formed forensic societies, which developed into &quot;doughnut league&quot; inter-dorm competitions in the 1890s.
In 1891, the UO began intercollegiate competition.
Forensics continued to grow as a staple of the university's community and by 1911, the team was so successful that it began charging admission to debates.
Money raised during these events was often donated to the fledgling University of Oregon football program.</p>
<p><a>Parliamentary debate</a> was integrated into UO Forensics in 1998-99 and the team has been competitive since.
In 2001, the UO's Alan Tauber and Heidi Ford claimed a national title, winning the first ever <a>National Parliamentary Tournament of Excellence</a> (NPTE).
As of 2007, the team is coached by Aaron Donaldson, who debated for <a>Carroll College</a> 1999-2003, and Luke Landry, who won the 2007 NPTE while debating for <a>William Jewell College</a>.
In the 2006-2007 season, the team won first place in the Northwest Forensics Conference's overall sweepstakes, due to regularly strong showings in both individual events and parliamentary debate.</p>
<h2>Notable alumni, faculty and staff</h2>
<p> </p>
<h2>The University of Oregon in film</h2>
<p>The film <em><a>National Lampoon's Animal House</a></em> (1978) was filmed on the university campus and the surrounding area.
The building used as the exterior of the Delta House (which belonged to the University of Oregon <a>Phi Sigma Kappa</a> chapter) was demolished in 1986, but the interior scenes were shot in the <a>Sigma Nu</a> house, which still stands today.
The Omega house belongs to the <a>Phi Kappa Psi</a> fraternity and still stands today.
The sorority house where Bluto climbs the ladder to peek in on the coeds was actually the exterior of the Sigma Nu fraternity.
Other buildings that were used during filming include Johnson Hall, Gerlinger Hall, Fenton Hall, Carson Hall, and the Erb Memorial Union (EMU).
The EMU dining facility known as &quot;The Fishbowl&quot; was the site of the famous food-fight scene.
The <a>Knight Library</a> and the Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art can also be seen in the movie.</p>
<p>Other films shot at the university include <em><a>Abe Lincoln in Illinois</a></em> (1940), <em><a>Five Easy Pieces</a></em> (1970), <em><a>How to Beat the High Cost of Living</a></em> (1980),<em> <a>Personal Best</a></em> (1982), <a>Stand By Me</a><em> (1986) (shot primarily in nearby <a>Brownsville, Oregon</a>), and </em><a>Without Limits</a><em> (1998).</em></p>
