<p>  <strong>Moody Bible Institute</strong> (<strong>MBI</strong>) was founded by evangelist and businessman <a>Dwight Lyman Moody</a> in 1886.
The campus, located in the heart of <a>Chicago</a> on the <a>Near North Side</a>, has remained at the same location chosen by Moody 120 years ago.
MBI consists of three major ministries: education, broadcasting and publishing.

<h2>History</h2>
<p></p>
<p><a>thumb|left|The historic Moody Bible Institute arch, viewed from within the central plaza.</a></p>
<p>In early 1886, D.L. Moody established the Chicago Evangelization Society, for the &quot;education and training of Christian workers, including teachers, ministers, missionaries and musicians who may completely and effectively proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ.&quot;</p>
<p>In 1870, Dwight Moody was introduced to <a>Emma Dryer</a>.
Emma was a principal and teacher at <a>Illinois State Normal University</a>.
Dryer was also deeply devoted to teaching the youth of Chicago about Christian doctrine and Scripture.
In 1871, after the <a>Great Chicago Fire</a> devastated much of the Chicago area, Moody began to simultaneously minister to the needs of those damaged financially and physically by the fire.
Moody invited all the youth to his Church, and Dryer was invited to teach Bible Study classes to these masses of people.
This fueled Moody's interest in education, which would later lead to the creation of the Institute.</p>
<p>In 1883, Dryer, with the permission of Moody, organized and headed what was known as the &quot;May Institute.&quot;
These were weekly meetings in which church members would meet and pray.
Most importantly however, would be the open discussions facilitated among the church members.
Many of the church members began to request that Moody open up a new school.
This school would serve as a training school for the youth of the Church, a place where future evangelists could learn the skills necessary to carry on in the Revivalist tradition.
On January 22, 1886, Moody addressed church members with the following, &quot;I tell you what, and what I have on my heart I believe we have got to have gap-men, men to stand between the laity and the ministers; men who are trained to do city mission work.
Take men that have the gifts and train them for the work of reaching the people.&quot;
This formal meeting, held at Farwell Hall, resulted in the group founding the Chicago Evangelization Society, which was later renamed the Moody Bible Institute after Moody's death.</p>
<p>Shortly after MBI was established, in 1894, Moody Publishers was founded under the name Bible Institute Colportage Association (BICA).
This publishing house made Moody&#x2019;s vision real by publishing books to reach a larger audience of Christians and non-Christians.</p>
<p>Before 1900, Moody played a significant role in fund raising to support MBI.
After he died, however, the Institute began to struggle financially.
At the time, <a>James M. Gray</a>, president of the school, invited <a>Henry Parsons Crowell</a> to restructure the Institute to become more financially self-sustainable.
Under Henry Parsons Crowell, the school was founded on business principles of productivity and performance.
The MBI Executive Committee met on Tuesdays, nearly every week for the next 40 years.
An administration building took years to complete, but when the building was dedicated, there was no mortgage, and only $50,000 left to pay.</p>
<p>In 1926, the Institute expanded its reach beyond education and publishing by sponsoring the first non-commercial Christian radio station in America, WMBI.
Over time, MBI&#x2019;s radio outreach grew to the Moody Broadcasting Network (MBN) which now owns and operates 35 commercial-free stations and provides programming via satellite to more than 700 outlets.</p>
<h2>Educational programs</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|Faculty members of Moody Bible Institute just prior to the Fall 2006 Opening Convocation.</a>
Its goal is to train students specifically for full-time ministry in churches and <a>parachurch</a> organizations.
Ministry intent is a necessary prerequisite for admission.
All undergraduate school tuition at the Chicago campus is funded by outside donations.
Undergraduates in Chicago are only responsible for room, board, certain fees (parking, building use, activity, library) and books.
Undergraduates at the Spokane campus are responsible for tuition also.</p>
<p>MBI is accredited by the <a>North Central Association of Colleges and Schools</a>, <a>the Association for Biblical Higher Education</a>, and the <a>National Association of Schools of Music</a>.</p>
<p>MBI replied to a survey published by the <a>Institute for Creation Research</a> noting that the school taught the origins of life on earth from the <a>old earth creationist</a> view, specifically choosing the following characterization: &quot;God created all life forms, but they appeared in the general sequence and time frame suggested by evolutionist theory&quot;.</p>
<h3>Undergraduate</h3>
<p>The undergraduate division is divided into eleven different departments.
The primary degree offered by the undergraduate school is the <a>Bachelor of Arts</a>.
The BA is available in more than two dozen fields, including theology, Bible, and missions of various emphasis.</p>
<p>In addition to the BA, MBI also offers a <a>Bachelor of Science</a> (BS) degree in Biblical Studies, a two-year Associates of Biblical Studies degree (ABS), and a five-year <a>Bachelor of Music</a> degree (BMus) in Sacred Music.
Furthermore, non-degree <a>TESOL</a> and Biblical Studies certificates are also available, which take one year to complete.</p>
<p>For those looking to attain a Bible degree online, three of these undergraduate programs are available through distance learning formats such as online, independent study, or regional classroom courses: the Bachelor of Science in Biblical Studies (BSBS), the Associate of Biblical Studies (ABS) and the Certificate of Biblical Studies (CBS).</p>
<p>MBI has a branch campus in Spokane, WA which offers a Bachelor of Science in Biblical Studies degree, Bachelor of Science in Mission Aviation Technology, Associate of Biblical Studies degree and Certificate of Biblical Studies.

<h3>Graduate</h3>
<p>The graduate division of Moody Bible Institute offers degrees at the seminary level.
The graduate programs do not require that the student have an undergraduate background in Bible.
The school offers the following degrees: <a>Master of Arts</a> in several fields, <a>Master of Ministry</a>, and <a>Master of Divinity</a> with several fields of emphasis.
The school also offers a graduate certificate that is a one-year program of study at the graduate level.

<p>All graduate degrees are available through traditional courses on the Chicago campus, or through distance education models by combining online and modular courses.</p>
<p>In addition to the Chicago graduate programs, what is now Moody Theological Seminary&#x2013;Michigan was founded as Michigan Theological Seminary by the Michigan Theological Society in 1994 in <a>Ann Arbor, Michigan</a> and later moved to Plymouth in 1996.
In November 2009, Moody Bible Institute and Michigan Theological Seminary jointly announced that plans for Michigan Theological Seminary to merge with Moody Bible Institute's Moody Theological Seminary and Graduate School had been approved by the relevant accrediting body.
In January 2010, Michigan Theological Seminary became Moody Theological Seminary&#x2013;Michigan.</p>
<h3>Continuing Education</h3>
<p>In addition to the undergraduate and graduate programs that offer courses for academic credit, Moody Bible Institute also offers non-credit continuing education courses for personal enrichment and professional development.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<p> All students are expected to adhere to a Student Life Guide (SLG) that provides guidelines for living while on and off campus.
Some of the concessions that students make in order to attend the Institute include abstaining from tobacco and drinking alcohol while enrolled at the Institute.
Students are allowed to take dance lessons and dance at celebration ceremonies, but there are no school sanctioned dance activities.
Freshmen are under curfew requirements (11 p.m. on week-days, and 1 a.m. on week-ends).</p>
<p>A wide variety of student organizations, four music groups, two award-winning student publications (the Arch yearbook and the Moody Standard newspaper), and a student radio station all provide outlets for student ministry, community, and creativity.
Moody's varsity athletic teams include men&#x2019;s soccer, men&#x2019;s and women&#x2019;s volleyball, and men&#x2019;s and women&#x2019;s basketball.
Moody also hosts intramural athletics including flag football, ultimate Frisbee, basketball, volleyball, soccer, water polo, and softball.</p>
<p>Residence Life sponsors the Brother/Sister floor program (Bro/Sis), which provides opportunities for students to interact with other male and female students of diverse backgrounds, especially since there is no visitation allowed between male and female students.
Shared meals, times of prayer and worship, open houses, city outings, and other activities are all a part of the Bro/Sis.</p>
<p>Undergraduate students are required to attend chapel every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.
Chapel is optional but encouraged for the graduate student body.</p>
<p>As part of the Practical Christian Ministry (PCM) program, each undergraduate student participates in a mandatory weekly ministry assignment.
Students serve in dozens of ministries in the Chicago area.
Each student&#x2019;s PCM assignment is a mandatory part of the academic requirements at Moody.</p>
<h3>Athletics</h3>
<p>Moody fields intercollegiate athletic teams in men's basketball, volleyball and soccer, and for women's basketball and volleyball.</p>

<ul>
  <li>1948-1971 <a>William Culbertson</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Upon the death of Houghton in 1947, the Institute trustees turned to William Culbertson, then dean, to become president.

Stowell left in 2005 to join Pastor James MacDonald's staff, as a teaching pastor of <a>Harvest Bible Chapel</a> in <a>Rolling Meadows, IL</a>.
As of February 1, 2008, Stowell accepted the position of president at the Cornerstone University in Grand Rapids, Mich.</p>

Easley explained in a letter to the Moody community, &quot;Surgery [for my back condition] has already once interrupted my tenure for several weeks, and unfortunately it has become clear that more treatment is required.
I have come to the difficult conclusion that under the circumstances I cannot be as effective a President as the Institute deserves.&quot;</p>

<p>This station was the beginning of what would come to be known as Moody Radio.
By the end of the 1960s, the network&#x2019;s potential audience had increased to 30 million listeners.</p>
<h3>Publishing</h3>
<p> Founded in 1894 by D.L. Moody under the name Bible Institute Colportage Association (BICA).
Moody founded BICA to facilitate the school's mission of affordable Bible education.
