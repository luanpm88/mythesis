<p><strong>Mary Mason Lyon</strong> (28 February 1797 - 5 March 1849), surname pronounced , was a pioneer in women's education.
She established the <a>Wheaton Female Seminary</a> in <a>Norton</a>, <a>Massachusetts</a>, (now <a>Wheaton College</a>).
Within two years, she raised $15,000 to build the Mount Holyoke School.
She also established <a>Mount Holyoke Female Seminary</a> (now <a>Mount Holyoke College</a>) in <a>South Hadley</a>, <a>Massachusetts</a> in 1837 and served as its first president (or &quot;principal&quot;) for 12 years.
Lyon's vision for Mount Holyoke fused intellectual challenge and moral purpose.
She valued socioeconomic diversity and endeavored to make the seminary affordable for students of modest means.</p>
<h2>Career</h2>
<p>The daughter of a farming family in <a>Buckland, Massachusetts</a>, Lyon had a hardscrabble childhood.
Her father died when she was six, and the entire family pitched in to help run the farm.
Lyon was thirteen when her mother remarried and moved away; she stayed behind in Buckland in order to keep house for her brother Aaron, who took over the farm.
She attended various district schools intermittently and, in 1814, began teaching in them as well.
Lyon's modest beginnings fostered her life-long commitment to extending educational opportunities to girls from middling and poor backgrounds.</p>
<p>Lyon was eventually able to attend two secondary schools, Sanderson Academy in Ashfield and Byfield Seminary in eastern Massachusetts.
At Byfield, she was befriended by the headmaster, Rev. Joseph Emerson, and his assistant, <a>Zilpah Polly Grant</a>.
She also soaked up Byfield's ethos of rigorous academic education infused with Christian commitment.
Lyon then taught at several academies, including Sanderson, a small school of her own in Buckland, Adams Female Academy (run by Grant), and the <a>Ipswich Female Seminary</a> (also run by Grant).
</p>
<h2>Mount Holyoke </h2>
<p>During these early years, Lyon gradually developed her vision for Mount Holyoke Female Seminary, which would resemble Grant's schools in many respects but, Lyon hoped, draw its students from a wider socioeconomic range.
The college was unique in that it was founded by people of modest means and served their daughters, rather than the children of the rich.
She was especially influenced by Reverend Joseph Emerson (brother of <a>Ralph Waldo Emerson</a>) whose 'Discourse on Female Education' (1822) advocated that women should be trained to be teachers rather than &quot;to please the other sex.&quot;
</p>
<p>Mount Holyoke opened in 1837.
Lyon strove to maintain high academic standards: she set rigorous entrance exams and admitted no students under the age of 16.
In keeping with her social vision, she limited the tuition to $60/year, about one-third the tuition that Grant charged at Ipswich Female Seminary.
Lyon, an early believer in the importance of daily exercise for women, required her students to &quot;walk one mile (1.6 km) after breakfast.
During New England's cold and snowy winters, she reduced the requirement to 45 minutes.
Calisthenics&#x2014;a form of exercise&#x2014;was taught by teachers in unheated hallways until a storage area was cleared for a gymnasium.
</p>
<p>In order to keep costs low, Lyon required students to perform domestic tasks&#x2014;an early version of work/study.
She also paid her teachers relatively poorly.
Though her policies were sometimes controversial, the seminary quickly attracted its target student body of 200.</p>
<p>Lyon  anticipated a change in the role of women and equipped her pupils with an education that was comprehensive, rigorous, and innovative, with particular emphasis on the sciences.
She required:  :seven courses in the sciences and mathematics for graduation, a requirement unheard of at other female seminaries.
She introduced women to &quot;a new and unusual way&quot; to learn science&#x2014;laboratory experiments which they performed themselves.
She organized field trips on which students collected rocks, plants, and specimens for lab work, and inspected geological formations and recently discovered dinosaur tracks.</p>
<h2>Religion</h2>
<p>Conforti (1993) examines the central importance of religion to Lyon.
She was raised a Baptist but converted to Congregationalism under the influence of her teacher Reverend Joseph Emerson.
Lyon  preached revivals at Mount Holyoke, spoke elsewhere, and, though not a minister, was a member of the fellowship of New England's New Divinity clergy.
She played a major role in the revival of the thought of Jonathan Edwards, whose works were read more frequently then than in his day.
She was attracted by his ideas of self-restraint, self-denial, and disinterested benevolence.</p>
<h2>Death and memory</h2>
<p>Lyon died of <a>erysipelas</a> (possibly contracted from an ill student in her care) on March 5, 1849.
The Mary Lyon dorms at <a>Swarthmore College</a>, <a>University of Massachusetts Amherst</a> and <a>Plymouth State University</a> are named in her memory.</p>
<p><a>Vassar College</a>, <a>Wellesley College</a> and the former <a>Western College for Women</a> were patterned after Mount Holyoke.
</p>
<p>She has been honored by the <a>United States Postal Service</a> with a 2&#x00a2; <a>Great Americans series</a> postage stamp.</p>
