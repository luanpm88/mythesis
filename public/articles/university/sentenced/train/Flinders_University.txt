<p><strong>Flinders University</strong>, or <strong>The Flinders University of South Australia</strong>, is a <a>public university</a> in <a>Adelaide</a>, <a>South Australia</a>.
Founded in 1966, it was named in honour of navigator <a>Matthew Flinders</a>, who explored and surveyed the South Australian coastline in the early 19th century.</p>
<p>The university has established a reputation as a leading research institution with a devotion to innovation.
It is a member of the <a>Innovative Research Universities</a> (IRU) Group and ranks among the leading universities in Australia.
Academically, the university pioneered a cross-disciplinary approach to education, and its faculties in medicine and the humanities are ranked among the nation's top 10.
It is also ranked within the world's top 400 institutions in both <em><a>Times Higher Education</a></em> and the <a>Academic Ranking of World Universities</a> by <a>Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Flinders University was opened by Her Majesty <a>Queen Elizabeth</a>, the Queen Mother, on 25 March 1966, as the Bedford Park campus of the <a>University of Adelaide</a>.</p>
<p>Just 18 days earlier, however, the South Australian Parliament had passed legislation to create an independent institution and the State's second university officially came into being on July 1.
There were 90 staff, four schools and just over 400 students.
Economist and professor <a>Peter Karmel</a> was the first Vice-Chancellor and Sir <a>Mark Mitchell</a> the first Chancellor.
The campus land has been owned by the State or Federal Government since 1915.
</p>
<p>The university takes its name from British navigator <a>Matthew Flinders</a>, who explored and surveyed the South Australian coastline in 1802.
Its coat of arms includes a reproduction of Flinders' ship <em>Investigator</em> and an extract from his book <em>A Voyage to Terra Australis</em>.</p>
<p>A significant early initiative was the decision to build the Flinders Medical Centre on land adjacent to the campus and to base the university's Medical School within this new public hospital - the first such integration in Australia.
FMC opened in 1976.
In 1990, the biggest building project on campus since the mid-1970s saw work commence on three new buildings - Law and Commerce; Engineering; and Information Science and Technology.
In 1991, as part of a restructuring of higher education in South Australia, Flinders merged with the adjacent Sturt Campus of the former South Australian College of Advanced Education.
In 1992 the present four-faculty structure was adopted.</p>
<h2>Campuses</h2>
<p>The university maintains a number of external teaching facilities in regional South Australia, south-west <a>Victoria</a> and the <a>Northern Territory</a>.
International students make up 10% of the on-campus student population and a number of offshore programmes are also offered, primarily in the <a>Asia-Pacific</a> region.</p>
<h2>Organisation</h2>

<p>The <em>Empire Times</em> was published by the Students' Association of Flinders University (SAFU) from 1969 to 2006.
The founder and first editor of the newspaper was Martin Fabinyi, and the newspaper was originally printed in the back of his house by fellow student Rod Boswell.
<em>Empire Times</em> had a history of controversial humour and anti-establishment discussion.
Notable former editors and contributors included Martin Armiger and Greg (HG Nelson) Pickhaver, Steph Key and Kate Ellis.
<em>Empire Times</em> ceased publication in 2006 as a result of <a>voluntary student unionism</a>.
</p>
<p>The newly formed student organisation, Flinders One, launched <em>Libertine Magazine</em> in 2008.
It is published quarterly at the beginning of each term.
Libertine is contributed to by students across the Flinders community and features articles, a feature artist, columns, creative writing, and a rant in each edition.
It is partially funded by outside advertising, which is liaised through Flinders One.
The magazine is distributed throughout campuses, and is a space for student creativity and voice.</p>
