<p>    <strong>Guilford College</strong>, founded in 1837 by members of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers), is an independent college whose mission centers on a commitment to the liberal arts; its academic reputation; social responsibility; principled problem solving; and core values of community, diversity, equality, excellence, integrity, justice and stewardship.
The small college focuses on teaching, interdisciplinary curriculum, service learning, and a student-centered approach to prepare students to live fulfilling lives.</p>
<p>Guilford is the third-oldest coeducational institution in the country, the oldest such institution in the South, and the fourth-oldest institution of higher learning in North Carolina.
The wooded campus is located in Greensboro, NC.</p>
<p>Guilford also states that it strives to provide supportive instruction that develops each individual; a diverse community; a sustainable community; and a values-rich education that explores the ethical dimension of knowledge and promotes honesty, compassion, integrity, courage, spirituality, and respect for each person.</p>
<p>Toward those ends, the college states that it strives to provide:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a student-centered instruction that nurtures each individual amid an intentionally diverse community;</li>
  <li>a challenging academic program that fosters critical and creative thinking through the development of essential skills: analysis, inquiry, communication, consensus-building, problem-solving and leadership;</li>
  <li>a global perspective that values people of other cultures and the natural environment in which we all live;</li>
  <li>a values-rich education that explores the ethical dimension of knowledge and promotes honesty, compassion, integrity, courage and respect for the individual;</li>
  <li>access to work and service opportunities that forge a connection between thought and action.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Principled Problem Solving.</strong>
Principled Problem Solving (PPS) is a central and unifying aspect of Guilford College&#x2019;s practical liberal arts educational experience.
PPS challenges students to focus their abilities and experiences toward solving real-world problems under the guidance of the college&#x2019;s core values of community, diversity, equality, excellence, integrity, justice and stewardship.
The purpose is to focus Guilford&#x2019;s mission in both the curricular and extracurricular life of its students towards the practical liberal arts.
This commitment requires Guilford students to learn to address problems critically, creatively, constructively, with courage and conscience.
Through foundations, practice, and application, students develop practical, creative, interdisciplinary, and cross-sector critical-thinking skills.</p>
<p>:<strong>The Center for Principled Problem Solving.</strong>
The Center was established in 2007 to deepen the understanding of PPS at Guilford.
This interdisciplinary, college-wide center promotes student, faculty, staff and community participation in PPS projects that put Guilford&#x2019;s core values to work in the world.</p>
<p>Students with varied talents and aims may profit from different methods of instruction.
Guilford deliberately offers a selection of educational experiences: courses combining lectures with discussion or laboratory; seminars demanding more direct participation by the student; and opportunities for independent study.</p>
<h2>Core Values</h2>
<p>Guilford College is guided by seven core values:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Community</strong>.
We are committed to the cultivation of positive relationships between, and common experiences among, students, faculty, and staff.</li>
<li><strong>Diversity</strong>.
We are committed to creating an academic institution where a variety of persons and perspectives are welcome.
We are committed to providing an environment where students from all cultures and backgrounds may succeed.</li>
<li><strong>Integrity</strong>.
We are committed to creating a community that acts with honesty and forthrightness, holding ourselves to high academic and ethical standards, and dealing with everyone with respect.</li>
<li><strong>Equality</strong>.
We are committed to creating an institution and a society where everyone is appreciated and judged based on their contributions and performance rather than gender, race, religion, physical abilities, sexual identity, or socio-economic condition.
Through the work of this institution, we will both create awareness of, and work to eliminate, individual and institutional racism.</li>
<li><strong>Justice</strong>.
We are committed to the peaceful resolution of conflict, sharing of economic and natural resources, and parity in educational opportunity.</li>

We are committed to making decisions that will ensure the long-term survival of this institution.
We must maximize the value of our human, financial, and physical resources in ways consistent with our Quaker heritage.</li>

We seek the personal and intellectual transformation of our students through the liberal arts.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Campus Life</h2>
<p>Originally founded in 1837 as the New Garden Boarding School, its name was changed to Guilford College in 1888 when the academic program expanded considerably.</p>
<p>Only about ten percent of the student body are Quakers; however, the independent institution is governed by Quaker principles.
Its academic atmosphere, like that of many Quaker colleges, is open and informal; for example, many professors encourage students to call them by their first names.
Guilford's current president is <a>Kent John Chabotar</a>, the first non-Quaker to hold the position.</p>
<p><strong>Diversity. </strong> The college's Diversity Plan guides the community.
The student body is diverse, as Guilford intentionally draws students from a wide geographic, political, religious, ethnic and socioeconomic background.
The college seeks to maintain an environment where all perspectives are valued and respected.
The Diversity Plan reflects the community&#x2019;s desire for an institution characterized by substantive equality and other aspects of our vision of multiculturalism, diversity, and inclusion.
Substantive equality focuses on the acceptance of many identities, desire for inclusive engagement, and assurance that entitlements, opportunities, and access are fairly and justly distributed throughout an organization.
It builds on cultural pluralism, defined as a condition of community in which numerous distinct ethnic, religious, or cultural groups interact constructively.</p>
<p><strong>Sustainability</strong>.
Guilford's sustainability initiatives make it one of the most &quot;Green&quot; campuses in America.
Guilford College signed the American Colleges and Universities Presidents Climate Commitment (ACUPCC) in May 2007, one of the first four North Carolina colleges and the first Quaker-founded college nationally to do so.
The goal of Guilford's Climate Action Plan is to reach carbon neutrality by 2047.
Guilford's 200 panels on eight buildings are the largest solar thermal system on a college campus in the U.S. 12 solar thermal panels installed in 2007 and 188 in 2010 (in partnership with FLS Energy) heat 60 percent of water needed by campus residents.
The Energy Use Limitation Program caps energy usage and 85 percent of campus buildings are individually metered, allowing precise documentation of electrical energy usage.
In addition to the President's Climate Commitment and energy and emissions, transportation initiatives, the curriculum, composting, water conservation, recycling, dining services, and the work of the Sustainability Council are also among the institutional support for sustainability.</p>
<p>The school also hosts <a>The Early College at Guilford</a>.</p>
<p>The school does not allow fraternities or sororities to be formed on campus.</p>

<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p>Guilford competes as an <a>NCAA</a> <a>Division III</a> and <a>Old Dominion Athletic Conference</a> member.
The school has won five national championships, including the 1973 <a>NAIA</a> men's <a>basketball</a> title, the 1981 NAIA women's tennis title and the 1989 (NAIA), 2002 and 2005 (NCAA Division III) men's <a>golf</a> titles.
Guilford has enjoyed additional recent success in golf and basketball.
The school is the location of the <a>Armfield Athletic Center</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Eastern Music Festival (EMF).</strong>
Every summer, the college hosts the five-week-long Eastern Music Festival (EMF), where both professional and student musicians come together for seminars and public performances.

<p>Probably the largest campus-wide event of the year, besides Homecoming, is &quot;Serendipity&quot;, held annually in the spring.
In its heyday during the late 1980s and early 1990s, the festival was attended by Guilford students and alumni as well as thousands of students from other local institutions in the Triad area.
Musical acts who have played this event include: Dave Matthews Band, Hootie and the Blowfish, Common, Talib Kweli, De La Soul, Luscious Jackson, The Violent Femmes and The Squirrel Nut Zippers.</p>
