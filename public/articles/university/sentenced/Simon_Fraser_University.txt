<p>SFU was ranked 1st among Canada&#x2019;s Comprehensive Universities in 2009 and 2010 by <a>Macleans Magazine</a> &lt;ref name=&quot;macleans_rank_2009&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;macleans_rank_2010&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;, 57th in the world and 3rd in Canada in 2009 by Webometrics Ranking of World Universities&lt;ref name=&quot;World Universities Ranking&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>left|thumb|250px|The newly constructed university in 1967, with the Academic Quadrangle as a centre of the campus.</a></p>
<h3>Founding</h3>
<p>Simon Fraser University was founded upon the recommendation of a 1958 report entitled <em>Higher Education in British Columbia and a Plan for the Future</em>, by <a>Dr.
J.B. Macdonald</a>, who recommended the creation of a new university in the Lower Mainland.
The British Columbia Legislature gave formal assent two months later for the establishment of the university.
In May of the same year Dr. Gordon M. Shrum was appointed as the university's first Chancellor.
From a variety of sites which were offered, Shrum recommended to the provincial government that the summit of Burnaby Mountain be chosen for the new university.
Architects <a>Arthur Erickson</a> and Geoffrey Massey won a competition to design the university, and construction began in the spring of 1964.
Eighteen months later, on September 9, 1965, the university began its first semester with 2,500 students.</p>
<h3>Early activism</h3>
<p> The campus was noted in the 1960s and early 1970s as a hotbed of political activism, culminating in a crisis in the Department of Political Science, Sociology, and Anthropology in a dispute involving ideological differences among faculty.
The resolution to the crisis included the dismantling of the department and its breaking-up into today's separate departments.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.peak.sfu.ca/gopher/94-3/issue4/another.ans</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>Coat of Arms</h3>
<p>The school's original <a>coat of arms</a> was used from the university's inception until 2006, at which point the Board of Governors voted to adapt the old coat of arms and thereby register a second coat of arms.
The adaptation replaced two crosslets with books after some in the university asserted the crosses had misled prospective foreign students into believing SFU was a private, religious institution rather than a public, secular one.&lt;ref&gt;<a>SFU
News Online - SFU's new coat of arms - February 07, 2007</a>&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the university decided to register both the old coat of arms and the revised coat of arms featuring the books.
In 2007, a new marketing logo was unveiled, consisting of white letters on block red.&lt;ref&gt;<a>SFU

<h3>The University today</h3>
<p><a>right|thumb|200px|Prof.
Andrew Petter, the current President and Vice Chancellor of SFU.</a></p>
<p>SFU's current president is <a>Andrew Petter</a>, whose term began on September 1, 2010.
Petter succeeds Dr. <a>Michael Stevenson</a>.
who held a decade long post as President from 2000 to 2010.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.sfu.ca/pamr/media_releases/media_releases_archives/media_01191001.html</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>In 2009, SFU became the first Canadian university to be accepted into the <a>National Collegiate Athletic Association</a> (NCAA)&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.sfu.ca/pamr/media_releases/media_releases_archives/media_07100901.html</a>&lt;/ref&gt;.
Starting in the 2011-2012 season, SFU will be competing in the NCAA&#x2019;s Division II Great Northwest Athletic Conference (GNAC).
Once completed, the transition will move all 19 <a>Simon Fraser Clan</a> teams into the NCAA.</p>
<p>SFU's research efforts have led it to obtain the highest publication impact among Canadian comprehensive universities, and the highest success rates per faculty member in competitions for Federal research council funding from <a>NSERC</a> and <a>SSHRC</a>.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.sfu.ca/report2008/research.html</a>&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2007, the University began offering <a>dual and double degrees</a> by partnering with international universities.
The first partnership involved <a>Zhejiang University</a> and a dual Computing-Science degree.
One year later, the University partnered with Australia's <a>Monash University</a>, to offer a double Bachelor of Arts degree.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.sfu.ca/pamr/media_releases/media_releases_archive/media_release11040801.html</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>SFU has been rated as Canada's best comprehensive university (in 1993, 1996, 1997, 1998, 2000, 2008, 2009 and 2010) in the annual rankings of Canadian universities in <em><a>Maclean's</a></em> magazine since 1991.
Research Infosource, Canada&#x2019;s leading provider of research intelligence evaluation, named SFU the top comprehensive university in Canada for &#x201c;publication effectiveness&#x201d; in 2006.
Similar to most <a>Canadian universities</a>, SFU is a public university, with more than half of funding coming from taxpayers and the remaining from tuition fees.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Undergraduate</h3>
<p>SFU is home to over 25,000 undergraduates.
The university has grown in recent years recently achieving an alumni population of over 100,000.
It has 946 faculty members and 3,403 staff.
International students make up 7% of its student body.
(University Community Report (2006/2007)).&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.sfu.ca/facts/stats.html</a>&lt;/ref&gt;
SFU's student union is known as the <a>Simon Fraser Student Society</a> (SFSS), which includes undergraduates who study at SFU.</p>
<h3>Graduate</h3>
<p>The university currently enrolls over 5,000 graduate students in a wide range of full-time and part-time academic programs &lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.sfu.ca/dean-gradstudies/prosp_students/academic_programs/</a>&lt;/ref&gt;.
International students comprise 20% of the graduate student population as a whole and 30-40% in science and technology areas.
A Graduate Student Society &lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.sfugradsociety.ca/News/News.html</a>&lt;/ref&gt;
supports and advocates for graduate students at the university.</p>
<h3>Staff unions</h3>
<p>Teaching Assistants, Tutor Markers, Sessional Instructors, and Language Instructors at SFU are unionized.
The union, The Teaching Support Staff Union (TSSU), is independent.
Faculty and lecturers are members of the Faculty Association.
Staff are members of the <a>Canadian Union of Public Employees</a> (CUPE), the Administrative and Professional Staff Association (APSA), or Polyparty.
A few positions at the university such as some in Human Resources and senior administrative positions fall outside of the five associations or unions above.</p>
<h3>Research and affiliations</h3>
<p>SFU also works with other universities and agencies to operate joint research facilities.
These include <a>Bamfield Marine Station</a>, a major centre for teaching and research in marine biology; <a>TRIUMF</a>, a powerful cyclotron used in subatomic physics and chemistry research; <a>MITACS</a>, headquarters of this <a>Network of Centres of Excellence</a> for 26 universities and 75 companies.

It has won several awards for sustainable planning and development.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.univercity.ca/news_+_events.8.html?newsId=144</a>&lt;/ref&gt;
Development of the community began in early 2000, when Simon Fraser University commenced construction on a new residential and commercial area occupying approximately  adjacent to the campus, atop Burnaby mountain.
As of January 2010, approximately 3000 people live in UniverCity.
A new elementary school, University Highlands, opened on September 1, 2010.</p>
<h2>Satellite campuses</h2>
<h3>SFU Surrey Campus</h3>
<p><a>thumb|left|175px|Central City, home to SFU Surrey</a> The SFU Surrey campus is the most recent satellite campus.
It is located in downtown <a>Surrey</a>, B.C., a quickly growing suburb of Vancouver.
The campus is part of Central City, an architectural complex adjacent to the Surrey Central <a>SkyTrain</a> station.
It was established in 2002 to absorb the students and programs of the former <a>Technical University of British Columbia</a> which was closed by the provincial government.
It has since expanded to house the Surrey operations of other SFU programs.
The Central City complex that houses the campus was designed by architect <a>Bing Thom</a> and opened in 2006.</p>
<h3>SFU Vancouver</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|175px|Woodward's Building, home to the School for the Contemporary Arts</a> SFU Vancouver was launched in the 1980s with a store-front classroom.
It was the first urban university classroom in British Columbia.
A significant portion of funding for the building of the campus came from the private sector.
The Vancouver campus has four buildings spread across the downtown core: SFU <a>Harbour Centre</a>, the Morris J Wosk Centre for Dialogue, the <a>Segal Graduate School of Business</a> and SFU Contemporary Arts at Woodward's.
The original campus building at Harbour Centre, a rebuilt heritage department store, officially opened on May 5, 1989.
Today, the entire campus serves more than 70,000 people annually.
Approximately 10,000 are graduate and undergraduate students enrolled in courses and degree programs based downtown.
&lt;!--<a>thumb|right|300px|SFU Woodwards, home to the School of Contemporary Arts</a>--&gt;</p>
<p>In September 2010, SFU Contemporary Arts relocated to the historic Woodward&#x2019;s district in downtown Vancouver known as the Goldcorp Centre for the Arts.
The 130,000-square-foot (12,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) SFU facility is part of the Woodward's revitalization project.
The new facility accommodates the increasing enrollment of students in the programme and new cultural facilities, including the Fei and Milton Wong Experimental theatre, screening rooms, sound studios, and art galleries.

<h2>Alumni</h2>
<h3>Terry Fox</h3>
<p> One of the most highly regarded SFU alumni and one of Canada's most treasured sons is the late <a>Terry Fox</a>.
Diagnosed with bone cancer which resulted in the amputation of his leg, the 18-year-old kinesiology student set out to cross <a>Canada</a> on a grueling run called the <a>Marathon of Hope</a> to raise funding and awareness about cancer.
As a result of Terry Fox's legacy, running for charitable causes is now integrated within communities worldwide.
He also inspired friend <a>Rick Hansen</a>'s Man in Motion world tour by wheelchair.
In 2001, SFU awarded an honorary degree to <a>Betty Fox</a>, mother of Terry Fox and Honorary Chair of the Terry Fox Foundation.

<h2>Appearances in popular culture</h2>
<p>Due to the contemporary <a>Brutalist architecture</a> of the WAC Bennett Library and Academic Quadrangle, the main campus has been used for location shots in science fiction television series such as <em><a>Stargate SG-1</a></em>, <em><a>Battlestar Galactica</a></em> and <em><a>Andromeda</a></em>. Its first use as a film set was for the 1972 science fiction film <em><a>The Groundstar Conspiracy</a></em>, in which the entire campus complex was used.
It was then followed by <em>The Fly 2</em>, which has scenes shot inside and outside the Burnaby campus.
The AQ also served as a backdrop for shots of &quot;headquarters&quot; in the television series <em><a>The X-Files</a></em>.
The campus served as a high-tech corporate setting in the film <em><a>Antitrust</a></em>. Recently, in addition to other <a>Vancouver</a>-area landmarks, many parts of the Burnaby campus were used for the filming of the movie <em><a>The 6th Day</a></em> as well as <em><a>Agent Cody Banks</a></em>.
In early 2008, the Burnaby campus was again used for filming, this time for <em><a>The Day the Earth Stood Still</a></em> (2008 Remake).
Exterior shots of the campus AQ have also been used in the Vancouver-based TV series <em><a>J-Pod</a></em> (based on the book).
The SFU Surrey campus has been featured in several episodes of <a>Caprica</a> with the entire mezzanine and registration area being transformed into the Caprica Inter-colonial Space Port.
It has also been featured in the Smallville TV series and blockbuster movies such as iRobot, Fantastic Four and Catwoman.</p>
<p>Recently, filming of the TV show <em><a>Hellcats</a></em> commenced in the West Gym of the Chancellor's Gymnasium in November 2010.</p>
