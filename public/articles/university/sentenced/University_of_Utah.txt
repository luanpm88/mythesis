The university was established in 1850 as the University of Deseret by the General Assembly of the provisional <a>State of Deseret</a>,&lt;ref name=&quot;sesquicentennial&quot; /&gt; making it Utah's oldest institution of higher education.&lt;ref
name=&quot;fast facts&quot; /&gt; It received its current name in 1892, four years before Utah attained statehood, and moved to its current location in 1900.&lt;ref
name=&quot;sesquicentennial&quot; /&gt; It is one of ten institutions that make up the <a>Utah System of Higher Education</a>.</p>
<p>The university offers more than 100 undergraduate majors and more than 90 graduate degree programs.&lt;ref
name=&quot;fast facts&quot; /&gt; Graduate studies include the <a>S.J. Quinney College of Law</a> and the <a>School of Medicine</a>, Utah's only <a>medical school</a>.&lt;ref

<h2>History</h2>
<p>[[Image:MountVanCott.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Block U]] has overlooked the university since 1907&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;]]The university was established on February 28, 1850, as the University of Deseret by the General Assembly of the provisional <a>State of Deseret</a>, and <a>Orson Spencer</a> was appointed as the first chancellor of the university.
Early classes were held in private homes or wherever space could be found.
The university closed in 1853 due to lack of funds and lack of <a>feeder school</a>s.</p>
<p>Following years of intermittent classes in the Salt Lake City Council House, the university began to be reestablished in 1867 under the direction of <a>David O. Calder</a>, who was followed by <a>John R. Park</a> in 1869.
The university moved out of the council house into the Union Academy building in 1876 and into Union Square in 1884.
In 1892, the school's name was changed to the University of Utah, and <a>John R. Park</a> began arranging to obtain land belonging to the U.S. Army's <a>Fort Douglas</a> on the east bench of the <a>Salt Lake Valley</a>, where the university moved permanently in 1900.
Additional <a>Fort Douglas</a> land has been granted to the university over the years, and the fort was officially closed on October 26, 1991.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Upon his death in 1900, Dr. John R. Park bequeathed his entire fortune to the university.&lt;ref
name=&quot;sesquicentennial&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;history of utah&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The university grew rapidly in the early 20th century but was involved in an <a>academic freedom</a> controversy in 1915 when <a>Joseph T. Kingsbury</a> recommended that five faculty members be dismissed after a graduation speaker made a speech critical of mayor <a>William Spry</a>.
One third of the faculty resigned in protest of these dismissals.
Some felt that the dismissals were a result of the <a>LDS Church</a>'s influence on the university, while others felt that they reflected a more general pattern of repressing religious and political expression that might be deemed offensive.
The controversy was largely resolved when Kingsbury resigned in 1916, but university operations were again interrupted by World War I, and later <a>The Great Depression</a> and World War II.
Student enrollment dropped to a low of 3,418 during the last year of World War II, but <a>A.
Ray Olpin</a> was able to make substantial additions to campus following the war, and enrollment reached 12,000 by the time he retired in 1964.
Growth continued throughout the following decades as the university developed into a center for computer, medical, and other research.&lt;ref
name=&quot;sesquicentennial&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;transition&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>During the <a>2002 Winter Olympics</a>, the university hosted the Olympic Village&lt;ref name=&quot;olympic village&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the opening and closing ceremonies.&lt;ref
name=&quot;olympic stadium&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the events, the university received a facelift that included extensive renovations to the <a>Rice&#x2013;Eccles Stadium</a>,&lt;ref name=&quot;olympic stadium&quot; /&gt; a <a>light rail</a> track leading to downtown Salt Lake City,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; a new student center known as the Heritage Center,&lt;ref name=&quot;olympic village&quot; /&gt; an array of new student housing,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and a 134-room campus hotel and conference center.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|A view of lower campus</a>Campus takes up , including the Health Sciences complex, <a>Research Park</a>, and <a>Fort Douglas</a>.&lt;ref
name=&quot;inventory&quot; /&gt; It is located on the east bench of the <a>Salt Lake Valley</a>, close to the <a>Wasatch Range</a> and approximately 2 miles east of <a>downtown Salt Lake City</a>.</p>
<p>Most courses take place on the west side of campus, known as lower campus due to its lower elevation.
<a>Presidents Circle</a> is a loop of buildings named after past university presidents with a courtyard in the center.
Major libraries on lower campus include the <a>J.
Willard Marriott Library</a> and the <a>S.J. Quinney Law Library</a>.&lt;ref
name=&quot;inventory&quot; /&gt; The primary <a>student activity center</a> is the <a>A.
Ray Olpin</a> University Union, and campus fitness centers include the Health, Physical Education, and Recreation Complex (HPER) and the <a>Nielsen Fieldhouse</a>.&lt;ref
name=&quot;inventory&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>

South of the health sciences complex, several university residence halls and apartments are clustered together near <a>Fort Douglas</a> and the Heritage Center, which serves as a student center and cafeteria for this area.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition, there are 1,115 university apartments for students, staff, and faculty across three apartment complexes on campus.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
At the southeast end of campus is <a>Research Park</a>, which is home to research companies including <a>ARUP Laboratories</a>, <a>Evans &amp; Sutherland</a>,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; <a>Sarcos</a>, <a>Idaho Technology</a>, and <a>Myriad Genetics</a>.</p>
<p>Courses are also held at off-campus centers located in <a>Bountiful</a>, <a>Murray</a>, <a>Park City</a>, downtown <a>Salt Lake City</a>, and <a>Sandy</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>Transportation and sustainability</h3>
<p>A number of campus shuttles, running on biodiesel and used vegetable oil,&lt;ref name=&quot;sei&quot; /&gt; circle the campus on six different routes.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The <a>Utah Transit Authority</a> (UTA) runs several buses through the university area as well as the <a>TRAX</a> <a>University Line</a> (<a>light rail</a>), which travels through downtown Salt Lake City, where riders can transfer to the <a>Sandy / Salt Lake Line</a>, and terminates at the <a>Salt Lake City Intermodal Hub</a>, where riders can transfer to <a>FrontRunner</a> (<a>heavy rail</a>).
UTA runs limited trains directly from the university to Sandy on the <a>Sandy / University Line</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Students and staff are given free passes to ride UTA buses, TRAX, and FrontRunner.&lt;ref&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The university is ranked 4th by the <a>EPA</a> for annual <a>green power</a> usage among universities, with 23% of its power coming from <a>wind</a> and <a>solar</a> sources.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Other sustainability efforts include a permanent sustainability office, a campus <a>cogeneration</a> plant, building upgrades and energy efficient building standards, behavior modification programs, purchasing local <a>produce</a>, and student groups including a bicycle collective.&lt;ref
name=&quot;sei&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Sustainability and transportation are also a large part of the university's campus master plan.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The Sustainable Endowments Institute gave the university a &quot;B&quot; in its College Sustainability Report Card 2010, with A's for administration, climate change and energy, food and recycling, and transportation.&lt;ref

</p>
<h3>Notable programs</h3>
<p>The University of Utah has the only accredited <a>architecture</a> program in Utah,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the only <a>medical school</a>.&lt;ref
name=&quot;aamc&quot; /&gt; In 2009, <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></em> ranked the university's medical school 51st in the nation for medical research&lt;ref name=&quot;USUnivRankings_USNWR_Medr&quot; &gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and 29th in the nation for primary care.&lt;ref
name=&quot;USUnivRankings_USNWR_Medr&quot; /&gt; The school has made several notable contributions to medicine, such as establishing the first <a>Cerebrovascular Disease</a> Unit west of the <a>Mississippi River</a> in 1970 and administering the world's first permanent artificial heart, the <a>Jarvik-7</a>, to <a>Barney Clark</a> in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The <a>S.J. Quinney College of Law</a>, founded in 1913,&lt;ref&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; was the only <a>law school</a> in Utah until the 1970s.
In 2010, it was ranked 42nd in the nation by <em>U.S. News</em>.&lt;ref
name=&quot;USUnivRankings_USNWR_Law&quot; &gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p><a>thumb|upright|The Warnock Engineering Building</a>In 2009, the university's <a>College of Engineering</a> graduate program was ranked 62nd in the nation by <em>U.S. News</em>.&lt;ref
name=&quot;USUnivRankings_USNWR_Eng&quot; &gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The university's School of Computing, part of the College of Engineering, was ranked 39th in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The University of Utah was one of the original four nodes of <a>ARPANET</a>, the world's first <a>packet-switching</a> computer network and embryo of the current worldwide <a>Internet</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Notable innovations of faculty and alumni include the first method for representing surface textures in graphical images, the <a>Gouraud shading</a> model, magnetic ink printing technology, the Johnson counter <a>logic circuit</a>, the oldest algebraic mathematics package still in use (<a>REDUCE</a>), the <a>Phong reflection model</a>, the <a>Phong shading</a> method, and the <a>rendering equation</a>.
The school has pioneered work in <a>asynchronous circuit</a>s, <a>computer animation</a>, <a>computer art</a>, digital <a>music recording</a>, <a>graphical user interface</a>s, and <a>stack machine</a> architectures.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The School of Computing also takes part in the <a>Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute</a>, which continues to make advances in visualization, scientific computing, and image analysis.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>In the sciences, <em>U.S. News</em> ranked the university 36th in chemistry (2007) and 43rd in earth sciences (2006) among national graduate programs,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and the <a>Academic Ranking of World Universities</a> ranked the university 43rd in the world in the life and agricultural sciences in 2009.&lt;ref
name=&quot;USUnivRankings_ARWU_LIFE&quot; &gt; &lt;/ref&gt; The university has made unique contributions to the study of <a>genetics</a> due in part to long-term <a>genealogy</a> efforts of the <a>LDS Church</a>, which has allowed researchers to trace genetic disorders through several generations.
The relative homogeneity of Utah's population also makes it an ideal laboratory for studies of population genetics.&lt;ref
name=&quot;genetics&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The university is home to the Genetic Science Learning Center, a resource which educates the public about genetics through its website.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p>[[Image:Uofu huntsmancenter.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jon

<p>The university has 7 men's and 11 women's varsity teams.&lt;ref
name=&quot;athletics&quot; /&gt; Athletic teams include men's baseball, basketball, football, golf, skiing, swimming/diving, and tennis and women's basketball, cross country, gymnastics, skiing, soccer, softball, swimming/diving, tennis, track and field, and volleyball.&lt;ref
name=&quot;utah utes&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The school's sports teams are called the <a>Ute</a>s, though some teams have an additional nickname, such as &quot;Runnin' Utes&quot; for the men's basketball team.&lt;ref
name=&quot;basketball media guide&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The university participates in the <a>NCAA</a>'s <a>Division I</a> (<a>FBS</a> for football) as part of the <a>Mountain West Conference</a>.&lt;ref
name=&quot;football media guide&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, beginning in the 2011&#x2013;2012 academic year, Utah will play in the Southern Division of the PAC-12 Conference.&lt;ref&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
There is a fierce <a>Utah&#x2013;BYU rivalry</a>, and the <a>Utah&#x2013;BYU football game</a>, traditionally a season finale, has been called the &quot;Holy War&quot; by national broadcasting commentators.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The university <a>fight song</a> is <a>&quot;Utah Man&quot;</a>, commonly played at athletic games and other university events.&lt;ref
name=&quot;ute traditions&quot; /&gt; In 1996 Swoop the Red Tailed Hawk was introduced as the new mascot of the University of Utah.
Because of relationships with the local Ute Indians, Utah adopted a new mascot.
While still known as the Utes, Utah is now represented by the Red Tailed Hawk known for the use of his tail feathers in Ute head-dresses.
And said he &quot;Reflects the soaring spirit of our state and school&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;Utah Mascot&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; </p>
<p>In 2002, the university was one of 20 schools to make the <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></em> College Sports Honor Roll.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2005, Utah became the first school to produce #1 overall draft picks in both the <a>NFL Draft</a> and <a>NBA Draft</a> for the same year.&lt;ref
name=&quot;bogut&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; <a>Alex Smith</a> was picked first overall by the <a>San Francisco 49ers</a> in the <a>2005 NFL Draft</a>,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and <a>Andrew Bogut</a> was picked first overall by the <a>Milwaukee Bucks</a> in the <a>2005 NBA Draft</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The university has won ten <a>NCAA Skiing Championships</a>, most recently in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the 1977 <a>AIAW</a> National Women's Skiing Championship.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>Basketball</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The men's basketball team won the <a>NCAA</a> title in <a>1944</a>&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and the <a>NIT</a> crown in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; <a>Arnie Ferrin</a>, the only four-time All-American in Utah basketball history, played for both the 1944 and 1947 teams.
He also went on to help the <a>Minneapolis Lakers</a> win <a>NBA</a> Championships in 1949 and 1951.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
<a>Wat Misaka</a>, the first person of Asian descent to play in the NBA, also played for Utah during this era.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Utah basketball rose again to national prominence when head coach <a>Rick Majerus</a> took his team, including guard <a>Andre Miller</a>, combo forward <a>Hanno M&#x00f6;tt&#x00f6;l&#x00e4;</a>, and post player <a>Michael Doleac</a>, to the NCAA <a>Final Four</a> in <a>1998</a>.
After eliminating <a>North Carolina</a> to advance to the final round, Utah lost the championship game to <a>Kentucky</a>, 78&#x2013;69.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>Football</h3>
<p></p>
<p>[[Image:UtesRiceEccles2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rice&#x2013;Eccles

name=&quot;fiesta bowl&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The team ended its perfect 12&#x2013;0 season ranked 4th in <a>AP</a> polling.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>2008&#x2013;2009 was another undefeated year for the football team, coached by <a>Kyle Whittingham</a>, as they finished the season 13&#x2013;0 and defeated Alabama 31&#x2013;17 in the <a>2009 Sugar Bowl</a>.
Utah finished the season 2nd in <a>AP</a> polling, their highest rank ever.
At the end of the season, the Utes were the only unbeaten team in the country, with the nation's longest active streak of bowl victories (8).&lt;ref name=&quot;sugar bowl&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The Utah Utes will move to the <a>PAC-10</a> conference at the start of the 2011-2012 football season.
They will be in the South Division with <a>University of Colorado</a>, <a>University of Arizona</a>, <a>Arizona State University</a>, <a>UCLA</a> and <a>University of Southern California</a>.

<p>The women's gymnastics team, the <a>Red Rocks</a>, has won ten national championships, including the 1981 <a>AIAW</a> championship, and placed 2nd nationally eight times.
As of 2009, it has qualified for the <a>NCAA championship</a> every year, the only program to do so.
The program has averaged over 11,000 fans per meet 1992&#x2013;2010 and has been the NCAA gymnastics season attendance champions 16 of these 19 years.
In 2010, there was an average of 14,213 fans per meet, the largest crowd being 15,030.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>Marching band</h3>
<p>The university <a>marching band</a>, known as the &quot;Pride of Utah&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;official band page&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; perform at all home football games, as well as some away games and bowl games.
They performed at the <a>2005 BCS Tostitos Fiesta Bowl</a>, the <a>2009 BCS Allstate Sugar Bowl</a>, and the Inaugural Parade of President <a>Barack Obama</a>.&lt;ref
name=&quot;official band page&quot; /&gt;</p>
<p>The band began as a military band in the 1940s.
In 1948, university president <a>A.
Ray Olpin</a> recruited Ron Gregory from <a>Ohio State University</a> to form a collegiate marching band.
Support for the band dwindled in the 60s, and ASUU (the Associated Students of the University of Utah) discontinued its funding in 1969.&lt;ref
name=&quot;ute traditions&quot; /&gt; The band was revived in 1976 after a fund raising effort.&lt;ref
name=&quot;ute traditions&quot; /&gt; under the direction of Gregg I. Hanson&lt;ref&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; As of 2009, the band is under the direction of Dr. Brian Sproul.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<p>[[Image:Uofu union.jpg|thumb|right|[[A. Ray Olpin]] University Union and courtyard]]A large portion of university students live off-campus, as the university is located in a large <a>metropolitan area</a> and has beds for less than 10% of its undergraduate population in <a>residence halls</a> and single student apartments.
An additional 1,115 family apartments are available to students, staff, and faculty.
One of the university's primary four goals for long-term campus growth is to increase student engagement through the addition of on-campus housing, intramural fields, athletic centers, and a new <a>student activity center</a>.&lt;ref
name=&quot;plan elements&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The current student activity center, the <a>A.
Ray Olpin</a> University Union, is a common gathering place for university-wide events such as Crimson Nights, roughly monthly student activity nights; PlazaFest, a fair for campus groups at the start of the school year; and the Grand Kerfuffle, a concert at the end of the school year.
The building includes a cafeteria, computer lab, recreational facilities, and a ballroom for special events.
The Union also houses the <a>Lowell Bennion</a> Community Service Center and ASUU (the Associated Students of the University of Utah), which is responsible for appropriating funds to student groups and organizations on campus.&lt;ref&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; ASUU holds <a>primary</a> and <a>general election</a>s each year for student representatives, typically with 10&#x2013;15% of the student population voting.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Due to the large number of <a>LDS Church</a> members at the university, there is an LDS <a>Institute of Religion</a> building directly on campus, as well as several LDS student groups and 46 campus <a>wards</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Approximately 650 students participate in <a>fraternities and sororities</a> at the university, primarily located on &quot;Greek Row&quot; just off campus.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The University of Utah has a <a>dry campus</a>, meaning that alcohol is banned on campus.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>In 2004, <a>Utah</a> became the first state with a law expressly permitting <a>concealed weapons</a> on public university campuses.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The University of Utah tried to uphold its gun ban but the <a>Utah Supreme Court</a> rejected the ban in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h2>Media</h2>
<p>[[Image:EBC northeast.JPG|thumb|right|[[Eccles Broadcast Center]] is home to three broadcast stations]]The university has several public broadcasting affiliations, many of which utilize the <a>Eccles Broadcast Center</a>.
These stations include <a>KUED</a> channel&nbsp;7, a <a>PBS</a> member station&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and producer of local documentaries; <a>KUEN</a> channel&nbsp;9, an educational station for teachers and students from the <a>Utah Education Network</a>; <a>KUER</a> 90.1&nbsp;<a>FM</a>, a public radio affiliate of <a>National Public Radio</a>, <a>American Public Media</a>, and <a>Public Radio International</a>&lt;ref&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;; and <a>K-UTE</a> 1620&nbsp;<a>AM</a> a student radio station combining talk, current events, and music.&lt;ref&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p><em>The Daily Utah Chronicle</em>, also referred to as the <em>Chrony</em>,&lt;ref name=&quot;chrony press release&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; has been the university's independent, student-run paper since 1890.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
It publishes daily on school days during fall and spring semesters and weekly during summer semester.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The paper typically runs between eight and twelve pages, with longer editions for weekend game guides.
The paper converted to a <a>broadsheet</a> format in 2003 when the <a>Newspaper Agency Corporation</a> began printing it.&lt;ref
name=&quot;chrony press release&quot; /&gt; The <a>Society of Professional Journalists</a> selected the newspaper as one of three finalists for best all-around daily student newspaper in the nation in both 2007 and 2008.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Staff from the <em>Chronicle</em> feed into Utah journalism circles, some of them rising to considerable prominence, such as former editor Matt Canham, whose work with <em><a>The Salt Lake Tribune</a></em> earned him the Don Baker Investigative Reporting Award from the Utah Chapter of the <a>Society of Professional Journalists</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The <a>University of Utah Press</a>, the oldest press in Utah and now part of the <a>J.
Willard Marriott Library</a>, publishes books on topics including the outdoors, <a>anthropology</a> and <a>archaeology</a>, <a>linguistics</a>, <a>creative nonfiction</a>, <a>Mesoamerica</a>, <a>Native American studies</a>, and <a>Utah</a>, <a>Mormon</a>, and Western history.&lt;ref
name=&quot;media in fact&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; The university is also home to a national literary journal, <em><a>Quarterly West</a></em>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
