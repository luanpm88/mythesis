<p> </p>
<p>The <strong>University of Minnesota, Twin Cities</strong> (<strong>U of M</strong> or regionally <strong>the U</strong>) is a <a>public research university</a> located in <a>Minneapolis</a> and <a>St. Paul</a>, <a>Minnesota</a>, <a>United States</a>. It is the oldest and largest part of the <a>University of Minnesota system</a> and has the <a>fourth-largest</a> main campus student body in the United States, with 51,611 &lt;!----&gt;</p>
<h2>Campuses</h2>
<h3>Minneapolis campus</h3>
<p>:<em>External link: <a>Map of Minneapolis Campus</a></em> <a>thumb|Aerial photo of the Minneapolis campus, facing east</a> The original Minneapolis campus overlooked the <a>Saint Anthony Falls</a> on the <a>Mississippi River</a>, but it was later moved about a mile downstream to its current location. The original site is now marked by a small park known as <a>Chute Square</a> at the intersection of University and Central Avenues. The school shut down following a financial crisis during the American Civil War, but reopened in 1867 with considerable financial help from Pillsbury. It was upgraded from a <a>preparatory school</a> to a <a>college</a> in 1869.(Pitmod, Boc, Barryus &amp; Ouz).</p>
<p>Today's campus has buildings on both banks of the river, but the <strong>East Bank</strong> is the main portion of the campus and covers .</p>
<h4>East Bank</h4>
<p><a>thumb|left|East Bank</a>To simplify the size of campus, the University has broken down the <strong>East Bank</strong> into several areas: <strong>the Knoll area</strong>, <strong>the Mall area</strong>, <strong>the Health area</strong>, <strong>the Athletic area</strong>, and <strong>the Gateway area</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>The Knoll area</strong>, the oldest part of the University's current location, is located in the northwestern part of the campus. Most <a>discipline</a>s in this area relate to the <a>humanities</a>.  Burton Hall is home to the <a>College of Education and Human Development</a>. Many buildings in this area are well over one hundred years old and it includes a 13-building group comprising the <a>Old Campus Historic District</a> that is on the U.S. <a>National Register of Historic Places</a>. One residence hall, Sanford Hall, and one student-apartment complex, Roy Wilkins Hall, are located in this area. The Institute for Advanced Study  is located in the Nolte Center.</p>
<p>[[Image:Walter Library-20060904.jpg|thumb|left|Walter Library, [[Northrop Mall]]]] <strong>Northrop Mall</strong> or <strong>the Mall area</strong>, is arguably the center of the Minneapolis Campus. It was based on a design by <a>Cass Gilbert</a>, although his plans were too extravagant to be fully implemented. Several of the campus's primary buildings surround the Mall area. The <a>Cyrus Northrop Memorial Auditorium</a> provides a northern anchor, with <a>Coffman Memorial Union</a> (CMU) to the south. Four of the larger buildings on the sides of it are the primary <a>mathematics</a>, <a>physics</a>, and <a>chemistry</a> buildings, and Walter Library. The Mall area is home to both the <a>College of Liberal Arts</a>, which is Minnesota's largest public or private college, and the <a>College of Science and Engineering</a>. Behind CMU is another residence hall, Comstock Hall, and another student-apartment complex, Yudof Hall. </p>
<p><strong>The Health area</strong> is to the southeast of the Mall area and focuses on undergraduate buildings for <a>biological-science</a> students, as well as homes to the College of <a>Pharmacy</a>, the School of <a>Nursing</a>, the <a>School of Dentistry</a>, the <a>Medical School</a>, the <a>School of Public Health</a>, and Fairview Hospitals and Clinics. This complex of buildings forms what is known as the <a>University of Minnesota Medical Center</a>. Part of the <a>College of Biological Sciences</a> is housed in this area.</p>
<p>Across the street from Fairview Hospital is an area known as the &quot;<a>Superblock</a>&quot;. The  Superblock is a 4-city-block space housing four residence halls (Pioneer, Frontier, Centennial and Territorial Halls). The Superblock is one of the most popular locations for on-campus housing because it has the largest concentration of students living on campus and has a multitude of social activities between the four residence halls. </p>
<p><strong>The Athletic area</strong> is directly north of the Superblock and includes four recreation/athletic facilities: the University Recreation Center, Cooke Hall, the University Fieldhouse, and the <a>University Aquatic Center</a>. These facilities are all connected by tunnels and skyways allowing students to use one locker-room facility. North of this complex is the <a>TCF Bank Stadium</a>, <a>Williams Arena</a>, <a>Mariucci Arena</a>, <a>Ridder Arena</a>, and the <a>Baseline Tennis Center</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The Gateway area</strong>, an easternmost section, is primarily office buildings rather than classrooms and lecture halls. The most prominent building is <a>McNamara Alumni Center</a>. The University is also heavily invested in a <a>biomedical-research</a> <a>initiative</a> and is striving to build five more biomedical-research buildings in ten years that will form a biomedical complex directly north of TCF Bank Stadium.</p>
<h5>East Bank notable architecture</h5>
<p>[[Image:Pillsbury Hall.jpg|thumb|left|[[University of Minnesota Old Campus Historic District#Pillsbury Hall, 1889|Pillsbury Hall]], one of the oldest buildings on campus (1889)]] [[Image:Weisman Art Museum.jpg|thumb|right|[[Weisman Art Museum|Frederick R. Weisman Art Museum]]]] The <a>Armory</a>, northeast of the Northrop Mall, is built like a <a>Norman</a> <a>castle</a>, with a <a>sally-port</a> entrance facing Church Street, and a tower originally intended to be the <a>Professor</a> of <a>Military Science</a>'s residence, until it was found to be too cold. It originally held the athletics department as well as the military-science classes that it now holds. </p>
<p>One of the oldest buildings on campus is <a>Pillsbury Hall</a>, designed in the <a>Richardsonian Romanesque</a> style and built using varieties of sandstone available in Minnesota. It has a unique color that is hard to capture in a photograph.</p>
<p>In more recent times, <a>Frank Gehry</a> designed the <a>Frederick R. Weisman Art Museum</a>. It is a typical example of his work with curving metallic structures. </p>
<p>Another new building is the addition to the Architecture building designed by <a>Steven Holl</a> and completed in 2002. It won an <a>American Institute of Architects</a> award for its innovative design. The Architecture building was then re-named Rapson Hall after the local <a>modernist</a> architect and School of Architecture Dean <a>Ralph Rapson</a>. </p>
<p>The University also has historic <a>fraternities and sororities</a> buildings (a &quot;Greek row&quot;) north of Northrop Mall on University Avenue SE.</p>
<h4>West Bank</h4>
<p><a>thumb|Department of Theatre Arts &amp; Dance, Rarig Center</a> The <strong>West Bank</strong> covers 53&nbsp;acres (0.21&nbsp;km&#x00b2;). </p>
<p>The West Bank Arts Quarter includes: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Rarig Center (Theatre Arts &amp; Dance)</li>
  <li>The Barbara Barker Center for Dance</li>
  <li>Ferguson Hall (School of Music)</li>
  <li>Ted Mann Concert Hall</li>
  <li>Regis Center for Art</li>
</ul>
<p>The Quarter is home to several annual interdisciplinary arts festivals.</p>
<p>The Social Sciences are also on the West Bank and include the <a>Carlson School of Management</a>, the <a>Law School</a>, and the <a>Hubert H. Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs</a>.</p>
<p>Wilson Library, the largest library in the University system, is also located on the West Bank as is Middlebrook Hall, the largest residence hall on campus. Approximately 900 students reside in the building named in honor of William T. Middlebrook.</p>
<h4>Getting around</h4>
<p>[[Image:Washington Avenue Bridge Minneapolis.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Washington Avenue Bridge (Minneapolis)|Washington Avenue Bridge]] connects the East Bank and West Bank portions of the <a>Minneapolis</a> campus.]] The <a>Washington Avenue Bridge</a> crossing the Mississippi River provides access between the East and West Banks, either on foot, designated bike lanes, or via free shuttle service. The bridge has two separate <a>deck</a>s: the lower deck for vehicles and the upper deck for pedestrians. An unheated enclosed walkway runs the length of the bridge and shelters students from the weather.  Walking and riding bicycles are the most common mode of transportation among students. University Police occasionally cite individuals for <a>jaywalking</a> in areas surrounding the University resulting in fines as high as $250. This is often done at the beginning of a school year or after pedestrians interfere with traffic.</p>
<p>There are some pedestrian <a>tunnel</a>s to get from building to building during harsh weather.  The tunnels are marked with signs reading, &quot;<a>The Gopher Way</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>The Minneapolis campus is located near <a>Interstates</a> <a>94</a> and <a>35W</a> and is bordered by the Minneapolis neighborhoods of <a>Dinkytown</a> (on the north), <a>Cedar-Riverside</a> (on the west), <a>Stadium Village</a> (on the southeast), and <a>Prospect Park</a> (on the east).</p>
<p>Two <a>light-rail stations</a> have been proposed to serve the University along the proposed <a>Central Corridor</a> light-rail line. Stations have been proposed on the <a>East Bank</a> and the <a>West Bank</a>.</p>
<h4>Campus safety</h4>
<p>The University has a full time police department, commonly known as the UMPD, which provides around the clock law enforcement services on all University owned property as well as in the areas surrounding campus. Greg Hestness is the Chief of Police as well as the Assistant Vice President for Public Safety. The department employs 44 sworn officers who have jurisdiction throughout the State of Minnesota as well as approximately 20 support staff and over 100 student employees. The UMPD conducts patrols by foot, car, motorcycle, horse, and bike. In addition to general patrol, the UMPD has a Community Investigator division which investigates all crimes which occur on campus.</p>
<p>To promote safety on campus the University Police have funded a free escort service since the early 1980s, known as the Security Monitor Program.  The student employees of the Security Monitor Program offer free walking escorts to and from any location on or around campus to individuals regardless of University affiliation. This division of the University Police Department also provides security to various University departments and for special events on a contract basis. The University of Minnesota falls within the jurisdiction of the Minneapolis Police Department, but calls for service on campus are almost always answered by UMPD. The neighborhoods surrounding the University are patrolled by both the UMPD as well as the MPD and on the Saint Paul Campus, the Saint Paul Police Department. Minneapolis and University Police work together for special details such as &quot;Party Patrols&quot; which respond to noise complaints in neighborhoods surrounding the University on special occasions such as Homecoming, Spring Jam, and the weekends of most home Gopher Football games.</p>
<p>Minneapolis has been named as the safest metro in the United States by Forbes on October 2009. Despite this distinction, shootings have occurred near and on campus, most recently on January 25, 2010.</p>
<h3>St. Paul campus</h3>
<p>:<em>External link: <a>Map of St. Paul Campus</a></em> <a>thumb|Aerial photo of St. Paul campus, facing south</a> The St. Paul campus is located in the suburban city of <a>Falcon Heights</a>. Despite this, all campus buildings have St. Paul street addresses. The <a>College of Food, Agricultural and Natural Resource Sciences</a>, many other disciplines from social sciences to <a>vocational education</a> are located on this campus.  The extensive lawns, flowers, trees, wood lots and the surrounding University research farm plots creates a greener and quieter campus. It has a grassy mall of its own and can be a bit of a retreat from the more-urban Minneapolis campus. Prominent on this campus is Bailey Hall, the St. Paul campus's only residence hall.</p>
<p>The St. Paul campus is also home to the College of Design, the smallest freshman-admitting college within the University of Minnesota.  The College of Design, excluding architecture and landscape architecture, is located in McNeal Hall; consisting of Housing Studies, Apparel Design, Retail Merchandising, Graphic Design, and Interior Design.   </p>
<p>The St. Paul campus borders the <a>Minnesota State Fair</a>grounds.  The State Fair is one of the largest in the United States, usually lasting twelve days, from late August through <a>Labor Day</a> in early September. Because of the heavy traffic associated with the State Fair, classes do not start on either campus until after it is over, enabling the Fair to use the campus-parking facilities. </p>
<p>Although the Falcon Heights <a>area code</a> is 651, the University telephone system trunk lines use Minneapolis <a>exchanges</a> and its 612 area code.</p>
<h3>Commuting between Minneapolis and St. Paul campuses</h3>
<p>During the school year on regular weekdays, the shuttles operate with schedule-less service as often as every five minutes.  In 2008, the system carried 3.55 million riders.  Despite the fact that the shuttle service is free, it is comparatively inexpensive to operate: with an operating cost of $4.55 million in 2008, the operating subsidy was only $1.28 per passenger.  Even <a>Metro Transit</a>'s busy <a>Hiawatha light-rail line</a> required a subsidy of $1.44 that year, and that was with many riders paying $1.75 or more for a ride.</p>

<h2>Media</h2>
<p>[[Image:Northrupmall.jpg|thumb|left|The eastern edge of the [[Northrop Mall]], Spring 2008]]</p>
<h3>Print</h3>
<p><em><a>The Minnesota Daily</a></em>, as well as the <em><a>Minnesota Reporter</a></em> are printed Monday through Thursday during the normal school season, with an online-only version appearing Fridays. It is printed once each week during the summer. The <em>Daily</em> is operated by an autonomous organization of students and is the largest student-run paper in the U.S.. It was first published on May 1, 1900. </p>
<p>A long-defunct but fondly remembered humor magazine, <em><a>Ski-U-Mah</a></em>, was published from about 1930 to 1950. It launched the career of novelist and scriptwriter <a>Max Shulman</a>. </p>
<p>A relative newcomer to the University's print-media community is <em><a>The Wake Student Magazine</a></em>, a weekly magazine that covers University-related stories and provides a forum for student expression. It was first published in 2002 and became an officially University-sanctioned student group in 2003. </p>
<p>Additionally, the <em>Wake</em> publishes <em>Liminal</em>, a literary journal that began in 2005. <em>Liminal</em> was created in the absence of an undergraduate literary journal and continues to bring poetry and prose to the University community. The journal is free and has been received as a major success by the University community.. </p>
<p>In 2005 conservatives on campus began formulating a new monthly magazine named the <em>Minnesota Republic</em>. The first issue was released in February 2006, and funding by student service fees started in September 2006.</p>
<h3>Radio</h3>
<p>The campus radio station, <a>KUOM</a> &quot;Radio K&quot;, broadcasts an eclectic variety of <a>independent music</a> during the day on 770 <a>kHz</a> <a>AM</a>. Its 5,000-<a>watt</a> signal has a range of , but shuts down at dusk because of <a>Federal Communications Commission</a> regulations. In 2003, the station added a low-power (8-watt) signal on 106.5&nbsp;MHz <a>FM</a> overnight and on weekends. In 2005, a 10-watt translator began broadcasting from Falcon Heights on 100.7 FM at all times. Radio K also <a>stream</a>s its content at www.radiok.org. With roots in experimental transmissions that began before <a>World War I</a>, the station received the first AM broadcast license in the state on January 13, 1922, and began broadcasting as <a>WLB</a>, changing to the KUOM <a>call sign</a> about two decades later. The station had an educational format until 1993 when it merged with a smaller campus-only music station to become what is now known as Radio K. A small group of full-time employees are joined by over 20 part-time student employees who oversee the station. Most of the on-air talent consists of student volunteers.</p>
<h3>Television</h3>
<p>Some <a>television</a> programs made on campus have been broadcast on local <a>PBS</a> station <a>KTCI</a> channel 17. Several episodes of <em>Great Conversations</em> have been made since 2002, featuring one-on-one discussions between University faculty and experts brought in from around the world. <em>Tech Talk</em> is a show meant to help people who feel intimidated by modern technology, including <a>cellular phone</a>s and <a>computer</a>s.</p>
<h3>Computer</h3>
<p>The University developed <a>Gopher</a>, a precursor to the <a>World Wide Web</a> which used <a>hyperlinks</a> to connect documents across computers on the internet. However, the version produced by <a>CERN</a> was favored by the public since it was freely distributed and could more easily handle multimedia webpages.  The University also houses the <a>Charles Babbage Institute</a>, a research and archive center specializing in computer history.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p> <a>thumb|right|University of Minnesota Athletics &quot;Block M&quot;</a></p>
<p>The University's intercollegiate sports teams are called the &quot;<a>Golden Gophers</a>&quot; and are members of the <a>Big Ten Conference</a> and the <a>Western Collegiate Hockey Association</a> in the <a>National Collegiate Athletic Association</a> (NCAA). Minnesota is one of only 13 universities in the country offering NCAA <a>Division I-A</a> <a>college football</a>, <a>Division I</a> men's and women's <a>basketball</a>, and Division I <a>ice hockey</a>. The current athletic director is <a>Joel Maturi</a>.</p>
<p>The Golden Gophers' most notable rivalry is the annual college-football game between them and the <a>Wisconsin Badgers</a> (<a>University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Madison</a>, <a>Madison</a>, <a>Wisconsin</a>) for <a>Paul Bunyan's Axe</a>, the longest-running rivalry in <a>NCAA</a> sports. The two universities also compete in the Border Battle, a year-long athletic competition in which each sport season is worth 40 points divided by the number of times the teams play each other (i.e. football is worth 40 points because they play each other only once, while women's ice hockey is worth 10 points per game because they play four times a year). Conference and post-season <a>playoffs</a> do not count in the point standings.</p>
<p><a>thumb|left|Goldy Gopher, University of Minnesota-Twin Cities mascot.</a> <a>Goldy Gopher</a> is the mascot for the Twin Cities campus and the associated sports teams. The <a>gopher</a> mascot is a tradition as old as the state which was tabbed the &#x201c;Gopher State&#x201d; in 1857 after a political cartoon ridiculing the US$5-<a>million</a> <a>railroad</a> loan which helped open up the West. The cartoon portrayed shifty railroad <a>baron</a>s as striped gophers pulling a railroad car carrying the <a>Territorial Legislature</a> &lt;!--&quot;clarify me&quot; note: which territorial legislature - there were many i believe--&gt; toward the &quot;<a>Slough of Despond</a>&quot;. Later, the University picked up the nickname with the first University <a>yearbook</a> bearing the name &quot;Gopher Annual&quot; appearing in 1887.</p>
<h3>Football</h3>
<p> [[File:TCF Bank Stadium opener.jpg|thumb|right|[[TCF Bank Stadium]] replaced the <a>Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome</a> as the Gophers' home stadium in 2009.]] The Minnesota Golden Gophers are one of the oldest programs in college-football history. They have won 6 <a>National Championship</a>s and 18 <a>Big Ten Conference Championships</a>. The Golden Gophers played their first game on September 29, 1882, a 4-0 victory over <a>Hamline University</a>, St. Paul. In 1890, the Golden Gophers played host to the Wisconsin Badgers in a 63&ndash;0 victory. With the exception of 1906, the Golden Gophers and the Badgers have played each other every year since. The 117 games played against each other is the most-played rivalry in NCAA Division I-A college football .</p>
<p>In 1981, the Golden Gophers played their last game in <a>Memorial Stadium</a>. Between 1982 and 2008, the school hosted their home games in the <a>Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome</a> in downtown Minneapolis until they moved back to campus on September 12, 2009, when their new home, <a>TCF Bank Stadium</a>, opened with a game against the <a>U.S. Air Force Academy</a> Falcons, which Minnesota won 20-13.</p>
<h3>Basketball</h3>
<p> The Golden Gophers men's basketball team has won two <a>National Championships</a>, one <a>National Invitation Tournament</a> (NIT) Championship and eight Big Ten Regular Season Championships. They also have six <a>NCAA Tournament</a> appearances not including the 1997 appearance in which they reached the <a>Final Four</a> that was voided because of academic fraud, and three <a>Sweet 16</a> appearances.</p>
<p>The Golden Gophers men's basketball coach, <a>Dan Monson</a>, resigned on November 30, 2006. <a>Jim Molinari</a> served as interim head coach for the remainder of the 2006-2007 season.  On March 23, 2007, University officials hired former <a>University of Kentucky</a> (<a>Lexington</a>, <a>Kentucky</a>) head coach <a>Tubby Smith</a> as the new head coach.</p>
<p>The <a>Golden Gophers</a> women's basketball team has enjoyed success in recent years under <a>Pam Borton</a>, including a <a>Final Four</a> appearance in 2004. Overall, they have six <a>NCAA Tournament</a> appearances and three <a>Sweet 16</a> appearances.</p>
<h3>Ice hockey</h3>
<p> [[Image:Mariucci Arena.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mariucci Arena]]]] The Golden Gophers men's ice-hockey program has established itself in recent years (as it did during the tenure of <a>Herb Brooks</a>) as a dominating force in <a>college hockey</a>. A Golden Gophers hockey tradition is to stock the roster almost exclusively (sometimes completely) with Minnesota natives. The team has won 5 <a>Division I National Championships</a> and 12 <a>Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA) Regular Season Championships</a>, most recently in 2007. They also have won 14 <a>WCHA Tournament Championships</a> and have 19 NCAA <a>Frozen Four</a> appearances. Home games are played at Mariucci Arena. The Golden Gophers' big rivals are the <a>University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Madison</a> and the <a>University of North Dakota</a> (<a>Grand Forks</a>, <a>North Dakota</a>). </p>
<p>The Golden Gophers women's hockey team has won three National Championships and five WCHA Regular Season Championships. They have also won three WCHA Tournament Championships and have 6 NCAA Frozen Four appearances. They play their home games in <a>Ridder Arena</a>. They were the first collegiate women's hockey team to play in an arena dedicated solely to women's ice hockey.</p>
<h3>Wrestling</h3>
<p> The University has been fielding <a>wrestling</a> teams for 92 seasons. In that time, they have accumulated over 800 dual-meet wins, the sixth-highest total in college wrestling history. Home meets are primarily held in the 5,700-seat <a>Sports Pavilion</a> in the Williams Arena.  The Gopher team won three NCAA Division I Championships as well as several individual championships.</p>
<h2>Fight song</h2>
<p>The <em><a>Minnesota Rouser</a></em> is the University of Minnesota's <a>fight song</a>. It is commonly played and sung at various events such as <a>commencement</a>, <a>convocation</a>, and athletic games. It is among a number of songs associated with the institution, including the <a>Minnesota March</a>, which was composed for the University by <a>John Philip Sousa</a>.</p>
