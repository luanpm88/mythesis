<h2>Logo and philosophy</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left|300px|Makara UI Description.</a></p>
<p>The earliest form of the logo of University of Indonesia was created in 1952 by Sumaxtono (born as Sumartono), a student from 1951 Art Department Class, Faculty of Engineering, which was at the time known as the <em>Fakulteit Teknik Universiteit Indonesia</em>, located in Bandung.</p>
<p>The basic idea underlining the logo is the kala-makara, a symbol of the two sources of energy in nature. Kala is the energy from above (the power of the sun), while makara represents the energy from below (the power of the Earth) . The two powers are combined and stylized into a symbol that represents the function of the University of Indonesia as a source of knowledge and the works resulting from it which are disseminated wide and far.</p>
<p>The logo of the University of Indonesia carries the following interpretation: The tree, which includes the buds and the branches, represents science and its branches, implying as well that the buds will soon flourish and turn into new branches of science. The buds will continue to blossom as long as the main tree is alive. By this, Sumaxtono intended to state that branches of sciences will continuously grow according to the need and development of civilization.</p>
<p>Water pouring down from the makara signifies the works of science which are disseminated wide and far. Sumaxtono hereby implied that the University of Indonesia is a source of knowledge which produces intelligent graduates who are highly skilled and pious, have high morals and an open attitude, are responsive to the changes and advancement of science and technology, and are empathetic to the problems faced by the society. They are also the people who have the capacity to solve problems occurring wherever they are, following the academic principles.</p>
<p>The logo design and the meaning it carried were presented to Srihadi (a student from the 1952 class from the same department) in 1952. Prof. KRHT H. Srihadi Soedarsono Adhikoesoemo, M.A. who also created the logo of Bandung Technology Institute, was not sure who authenticated this logo or when. He was sure, however, that this logo was printed on the cover of the book titled Universiteit Indonesia, Fakulteit Teknik, Bandung: Rentjana Untuk Tahun Peladjaran 1952-1953 (University of Indonesia, Faculty of Engineering, Bandung: Course Plans for Academic Years 1952-1953), published by AID, Bandung, 120 pages, using the original design by Sumaxtono (without the pentagonal border).</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumbnail|left|200px|STOVIA medical school complex during the 1920s, the complex consists of buildings now known as the Faculty of Medicine of University of Indonesia <em>(top)</em> and Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital <em>(center)</em>.</a> The roots of the University of Indonesia (UI) date back to 1851. At that time, the colonial government of the <a>Dutch East Indies</a> decided to establish a school to train medical assistants. Such training lasted for two years, and the graduates were certified to provide simple and basic medical treatments. The degree conferred was Javanese Doctor, as the graduates were certified only to open their practice in the Dutch East Indies, especially Java. The program became more comprehensive, and by 1864 it was expanded to three years. By 1875, the program of study had reached 7 years in length and the graduates were entitled to the degree of Medical Doctor. The next step came in 1898, when the Dutch East Indies government established a completely new school to train medical doctors, named STOVIA (<em>School tot Opleiding van Inlandsche Artsen</em>). The prerequisite to enter STOVIA was roughly the equivalent of a junior high school diploma, but the school's education took 9 years, so it was a mix between high school and university education. Many STOVIA graduates later played important roles in Indonesia's national movement toward independence, as well in developing medical education in Indonesia.</p>
<p>In 1924, the colonial government again decided to open a new tertiary-level educational facility, the RHS (<em>Rechts Hogeschool</em>), to train civilian officers and servants. The RHS would later evolve into the Faculty of Law. In 1927, STOVIA's status was changed to that of a full tertiary-level institution and its name was changed to GHS (<em>Geneeskundige Hogeschool</em>). The GHS occupied the same main building and used the same teaching hospital as the current Faculty of Medicine. Many GHS alumni would later play roles in establishing the University of Indonesia.</p>
<p>After Indonesia gained independence, the Indonesian Institute for Higher Education (BPTRI) was established in Jakarta consisting of three faculties, namely Medicine and Pharmacy, Letters and Law. The institute produced its first 90 graduate students as medical doctors in the same year. When the Dutch colonial army occupied Jakarta in late 1945, the BPTRI moved to Klaten, Surakarta, Yogyakarta, Surabaya and Malang. In 1946, the Dutch colonial government established the Nood Universiteit or Emergency University at Jakarta. In 1947, the name was changed to Universiteit van Indonesie (UVI) or the University of Indonesia. Following the Indonesian National Revolution, the government established a state university in Jakarta in February 1950. The name was Universiteit Indonesia, comprising the BPTRI units and the former UVI, which was later changed into the University of Indonesia (UI).</p>
<p><a>thumb|233px|Rectorate, University of Indonesia's main building.</a> By 1950, UI was a multi-campus university, with faculties in Jakarta (Medicine, Law, and Letters), <a>Bogor</a> (Agronomy and Veterinary Medicine), <a>Bandung</a> (Engineering, Mathematics and Natural Sciences), <a>Surabaya</a> (Medicine and Dentistry), and <a>Makassar</a> (Economics). The Surabaya campus became the <a>University of Airlangga</a> in 1954, and in the following year, the Makassar campus became the <a>University of Hasanuddin</a>. In 1959, the Bandung campus became the <a>Bandung Institute of Technology</a>. The School for Physical Education, which was also located in Bandung, became part of <a>Padjadjaran University</a> in 1960. In 1964, the Bogor campus became the <a>Bogor Agricultural Institute</a> and the Faculty of Education in Jakarta became the <a>State University of Jakarta</a>. By 1965, UI consisted of three campuses, all in Jakarta, namely the Salemba campus (Medicine, Dentistry, Economics, Engineering, Science and the Graduate School), the Rawamangun campus (Letters, Law, Social Science and Psychology) and the Pegangsaan campus (Public Health and parts of Medicine)</p>
<p>In 1987, several faculties from Salemba campus and Rawamangun campus moved to a newly built campus in the outskirts of Jakarta. The campus in southern Jakarta is known as the Depok campus, since it is situated in the city of Depok.</p>
<p>In the year 2007-2008, the University of Indonesia underwent substantial reform. Revenue was significantly increased from 800 billion to 1.6 trillion rupiah. The number of research publications has also increased. This is also the case with the university's endowment fund.</p>
<p>The newly elected Rector of the University of Indonesia (July 2007), Prof Dr der.soz. Gumilar Rusliwa Somantri, is a reformist and the youngest leader among university presidents in Indonesia, and has a wide network of international connections. He has been elected to and currently serves on the Board of Directors of the Association of Pacific Rim Universities (APRU).</p>
<p>According to the latest survey of Globe Asia (2008), UI ranked number first among the top universities in Indonesia. This report has been supported by a leading Indonesian magazine <a>Tempo</a>, which carried out a survey and analysis to rank universities and education in Indonesia.  The University of Indonesia has also improved its research collaboration with international partners, and is looking forward to having more international faculty members and students join the university.</p>
<p>In August 2008, the University won the Indonesia ICT award for the smart campus with best Content and Application. In terms of Accessibility and Connectivity, the University of Indonesia has also won an award due to the fact that 90% of the university's area is covered by IT infrastructure and services with its 305 Mbit/s. connection to the Internet, and its 155 Mbit/s. connection to the Indonesia Higher Education research Network (Inherent).</p>
