<h2>History</h2>
<p>King's College was founded in 1946 by the <a>Congregation of Holy Cross</a> from the <a>University of Notre Dame</a>. The college was initially built to educate the sons of local <a>miners</a> and mill workers that lived in the <a>Northeastern Pennsylvania</a> region. Their administration building was built back in 1913, before the college even existed. It was first established as the <a>headquarters</a> of the <a>Lehigh Valley</a> <a>Coal Company</a>. The building was designed by <a>Daniel Burnham</a> of <a>Chicago</a>. </p>
<p>Nearby, at the corner of Franklin and Jackson Streets, the college's <a>Chapel</a> of &quot;Christ the King&quot; houses a 4,200-pound <a>anthracite</a> <a>altar</a> (symbolizing the relationship between the coal industry and the college). It was created for King's in 1954 by the great <a>African- American</a> coal <a>sculptor</a> and Wilkes-Barre resident, C. Edgar Patience.</p>
<p>In June 1972, massive <a>flooding</a> occurred in downtown Wilkes-Barre. Rains from <a>Tropical Storm Agnes</a> caused the neighboring <a>Susquehanna River</a> to overflow and flood most of the campus.</p>
