<p><strong>Kenyon College</strong> is a private <a>liberal arts college</a> in <a>Gambier, Ohio</a>, founded in 1824 by Bishop <a>Philander Chase</a> of <a>The Episcopal Church</a>, in parallel with the <a>Bexley Hall</a> seminary. It is the oldest private college in <a>Ohio</a>. The campus is noted for its <a>Collegiate Gothic</a> architecture and rustic setting, and it was named one of the most beautiful college campuses in the world by Forbes in 2010.  Old Kenyon Hall, built in 1827, is believed to be the oldest <a>Gothic revival</a> building in the Americas, though it has burnt twice and been rebuilt.  Kenyon College is <a>accredited</a> by <a>The Higher Learning Commission</a> of the <a>North Central Association of Colleges and Schools</a>.</p>
<h2>Founding</h2>
<p>[[Image:Chase Philander-Bishop Episcopal Church USA.jpg|thumb|187px|left|[[Philander Chase]] was the founder and first president of <a>Bexley Hall</a> and Kenyon College, and later became Presiding Bishop of The Episcopal Church]]</p>
<p>After becoming the first Bishop of Ohio in 1818, Philander Chase found a severe lack of trained clergy on the Ohio frontier. He planned to create a seminary to rectify this problem, but could find little support. Undeterred, he sailed to England and solicited donations from <a>Lord Kenyon</a>, <a>Lord Gambier</a>, and the writer and philanthropist <a>Hannah More</a>, and the College was incorporated in December, 1824. Dissatisfied with the original location of the College in <a>Worthington</a>, Chase purchased eight thousand acres (32&nbsp;km&#x00b2;) of land in <a>Knox County</a> (with the <a>Mount Vernon</a> lawyer Henry Curtis), and reached what he would name Gambier Hill on July 24, 1825. There is a legend that Bishop Chase exclaimed, &quot;Well, this will do&quot; upon reaching the crest of the hill.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>Kenyon's English department first gained recognition with the arrival of the poet and critic <a>John Crowe Ransom</a> in 1937 as Professor of Poetry and first editor of <em><a>The Kenyon Review</a></em>, a literary journal.</p>
<p>Aside from English, other majors Kenyon offers are: Art (Studio), Art History, Dance and Drama, Music, Modern Languages, Philosophy, Religious Studies, Classics, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics, Neuroscience, Physics, Psychology, Anthropology, Economics, History, Political Science, Sociology, American Studies, International Studies, and Women's and Gender Studies.</p>
<p>Kenyon does offer concentrations, which are interdisciplinary minors. They are: African and African-American Studies, Asian Studies, Environmental Studies, Integrated Program in Humane Studies, Islamic Civilizations and Cultures, Law and Society, Neuroscience, Public Policy, and Scientific Computing. Kenyon also offers opportunities for synoptic majors based on a process of academic approval by the College administration.</p>
<p>Kenyon requires students to take classes in each of the four academic divisions: <strong>Fine Arts</strong> (encompassing the departments of Art, Dance and Drama, and Music); <strong>Humanities</strong> (Classics, English, Modern Languages and Literatures, Philosophy, Religious Studies); <strong>Natural Sciences</strong> (Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics, Physics, Psychology); and <strong>Social Sciences</strong> (Anthropology, Economics, History, Political Science, Sociology). In addition, students must show a basic competence in a foreign language, and also undertake a comprehensive senior exercise for their major during their senior year.</p>
<p>Kenyon is also home to the Beta of Ohio Chapter of the <a>Phi Beta Kappa Society</a>.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p><a>left|thumb|300px|The Ransom Hall at Kenyon College</a> Kenyon's sports teams, which compete in the <a>North Coast Athletic Conference</a>, are referred to as the <em>Lords</em> and <em>Ladies</em>, and their colors are purple, white, and black with gold often added as an accent. The college's men's swimming team is considered the best in <a>NCAA</a> Division III, for winning, from 1980 through 2010, an NCAA record 31 consecutive <a>national championships</a>. The women's swimming team is also considered among the best, winning 23 titles of its own (not consecutively) since 1984.  Swim Coach <a>Jim Steen</a> has coached the most conference titles in any sport in <a>NCAA</a> history. During the 1980s and 90s, Diving Coach <a>Fletcher Gilders</a> led his athletes to fourteen consecutive North Coast Athletic Conference championships and eight individual NCAA Division III titles; Gilders would also earn NCAA D3 Coach of the Year honors on three separate occasions.</p>
<p>In 2006, Kenyon opened the $70 million <a>Kenyon Athletic Center</a> (KAC), a 263,000 square foot (24,434 m&#x00b2;, 6 acre) building that houses an Olympic-sized swimming pool, two basketball courts, eight squash courts, a weight room, a 200m track, four tennis courts and other facilities.</p>
<h2>Rankings</h2>
<p>The 2005 <em><a>Princeton Review</a></em> and <em>Fiske Guide to Colleges 2005</em> awarded the college top academic ratings. In addition, in 2006 <em><a>Newsweek</a></em> selected Kenyon College as one of twenty-five &quot;New Ivies&quot; on the basis of admissions statistics as well as interviews with administrators, students, faculty and alumni. Since June 2007, Kenyon College has chosen not to participate in the <em>US News and World Report</em><img>s college ranking list. In 2009, <em>Forbes Magazine</em>, ranked Kenyon #22 out of the 600 colleges and universities on its list of America's Best Colleges 2009.</p>
<h2>Traditions</h2>
<p>As Ohio's oldest private college, All students in each entering class are expected to take the <a>Matriculation</a> Oath and sign a Matriculation Book that dates back at least a century.</p>
<p>Another tradition is the &quot;First-Year Sing.&quot; Each year, entering first-years gather on the steps of Rosse Hall to sing Kenyon songs before they are officially part of the Kenyon community. On the day before Commencement, seniors gather on the steps of Rosse Hall to sing the same songs again.</p>
<p>Whenever a new president begins a term at the college, candles are lit in every window of Old Kenyon, as a sign of welcome. Kenyon has had twenty-four presidents, and currently has its first female president, S. Georgia Nugent.</p>
