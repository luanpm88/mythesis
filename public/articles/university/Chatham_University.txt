<p>  <strong>Chatham University</strong> is an <a>American</a> <a>university</a> with a <a>women's undergraduate college</a> and <a>coeducational</a> graduate programs through the doctoral level, located in <a>Pittsburgh</a>, <a>Pennsylvania</a>'s <a>Shadyside</a> neighborhood.  The campus population of approximately 2,300 includes undergraduate women and graduate women and men. The University grants certificates and degrees including bachelor, master, first-professional, and doctorate. In 2005 the University expanded its programs to include online degree programs (bachelors, masters, doctoral) through the School of Continuing Education, now the <a>College for Continuing and Professional Studies</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Founded as the Pennsylvania Female College on December 11, 1869, by Reverend William Trimble Beatty, Chatham was initially situated in the Berry mansion on Woodland Road off Fifth Avenue in the neighborhood of Shadyside.  The campus today is composed of buildings and grounds from a number of former private mansions, including those of <a>Andrew Mellon</a>, Edward Stanton Fickes, George M. Laughlin Jr. and James Rea.  It was renamed Pennsylvania College for Women in 1890, and as Chatham College in 1955.  The name served to honor <a>William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham</a> and namesake of the City of <a>Pittsburgh</a>.  The school gained <a>university</a> status from the <a>Pennsylvania Department of Education</a> on April 23, 2007 and publicly announced its new status on 2007-05-01, changing its name to Chatham University.</p>
<p>With elements designed for the original Andrew Mellon estate by the renowned <a>Olmsted Brothers</a>, the  Chatham campus was designated an <a>arboretum</a> in 1998 by the American Association of Botanical Gardens and Arboreta.  It features over 115 different varieties of species, including Japanese Flowering Crabapple, <a>River Birch</a> and <a>Kentucky Coffee Tree</a>. The Arboretum provides an outdoor classroom for students in the University&#x2019;s Landscape Architecture and Landscape Studies programs, as well as an inviting place to stroll and to meditate.</p>
<p>In 2007, Chatham's M.F.A. Program in Creative Writing was named one of the top five Innovative/Unique Programs by <em><a>The Atlantic Monthly</a></em>.</p>
<h2>Campuses</h2>
<p>The original Shadyside Campus is part of historic Woodland Road. The Shadyside Campus now includes Chatham Eastside, which serves as the home for health science and architecture programs. </p>

<p>The University&#x2019;s new  Eden Hall Campus is located north of the city in Richland Township, Pa. and will be the home of Chatham&#x2019;s new School of Sustainability and the Environment. Programs at Eden Hall Campus include initiatives in sustainability and environmental studies, food studies, landscape architecture, and women&#x2019;s studies.  The Eden Hall Campus was donated to Chatham University by the Eden Hall Foundation on May 1, 2008.  Currently the architectural team of <a>Berkebile Nelson Immenschuh McDowell (BNIM)</a> of Kansas City, Mo., which is partnering with landscape design firm <a>Andropogon Associates</a> of Philadelphia to lead the master planning process.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>

<p>The University structure includes three distinctive Colleges: <strong><a>Chatham College for Women</a></strong> houses academic and co-curricular programs for undergraduate women and embodies the traditions and rituals of the traditional women's college. The <strong><a>College for Graduate Studies</a></strong> offers women and men both masters and doctoral programs.  Programs within the College for Graduate Studies include concentrations in art and architecture, business, health sciences, teaching and creative writing.  The <strong><a>College for Continuing and Professional Studies</a></strong>, formerly the School of Continuing Education, provides online and hybrid undergraduate and graduate degree programs for women and men, certificate programs, and community programming including the Summer Music and Arts Day Camp.</p>
<h2>School of Sustainability and the Environment</h2>
<p>The <a>School of Sustainability and the Environment</a>, founded June 2009, further expands the potential of the Eden Hall Campus and honors the legacy of its 1929 alumna and founder of the modern environmental movement, Rachel Carson. SSE will provide opportunities for the University&#x2019;s students to earn certificates and degrees through the master&#x2019;s level. The first program offered through SSE is the <a>Master of Arts in Food Studies</a>, which enrolled 30 students in its inaugural year. SSE will eventually be located at the University's Eden Hall Campus.  </p>
<p>In fall 2010 the University selected <a>David M. Hassenzahl, Ph.D.</a> as the founding Dean of the School of Sustainability and the Environment. Dr. Hassenzahl is the coauthor of several books, including <em>Should We Risk It?</em> (Princeton University Press) with Daniel M. Kammen; <em>Environment</em> (J. Wiley and Sons), with Peter Raven and Linda Berg, and, most recently, <em>Visualizing Environmental Science</em> (J. Wiley and Sons), with Linda Berg and Mary Catherine Hager.</p>
<p>Dr. Hassenzahl is a Senior Fellow of the National Council for Science and the Environment, through which his climate change education efforts are supported by the Nation Science Foundation and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Prior to joining Chatham, he served recently as Chair and Associate Professor in the Department of Environmental Studies at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Recognition for his work includes the Society for Risk Analysis Outstanding Educator Award, the UNLV Outstanding Department Chair Award, and the UNLV Foundation Distinguished Teaching Award. He serves on the Council of the Society for Risk Analysis, and is Secretary of the Association of Environmental Studies and Sciences. In addition to his academic credentials, Dr. Hassenzahl has experience with sustainability and environmental management in both the public and private sectors.</p>
<p>In addition to his responsibilities at Chatham, Dr. Hassenzahl is currently the Principle Investigator for the Climate Adaptation and Mitigation E&#x2013;Learning (CAMEL) project. CAMEL is a three&#x2013;year effort funded by the National Science Foundation, though the National Council for Science and Environment (NCSE). Begun in October 2009, CAMEL has begun to improve undergraduate education on climate change causes, consequences, and solutions by engaging a community of faculty members and students in developing an extensive, vetted online collection of high&#x2013;quality educational materials about the causes, consequences, mitigation, and adaptation associated with climate change. The project provides resources, training, and on&#x2013;line professional networking opportunities for students and faculty engaged in studying climate change, using cyber&#x2013;infrastructure built for the NCSE&#x2019;s Encyclopedia of Earth.</p>
<p>Dr. Hassenzahl holds a B.A. in Environmental Science and Paleontology from the University of California at Berkeley, and a Ph.D. in Science, Technology and Environmental Policy from Princeton University.</p>

<h2>Notable alumni</h2>
<p>Among Chatham's notable alumnae is <a>biologist</a> and <a>zoologist</a> <a>Rachel Carson</a> (1929), after whom the <em>Rachel Carson Institute</em> at Chatham is named.  The RCI, as it is known, promotes understanding of <a>environmental</a> issues through conferences, lectures, discussion panels, and other methods.  In honor of Rachel Carson's legacy, the University President, Esther L. Barazzone, Ph.D. and others led a campaign to rename the Ninth Street Bridge in <a>Downtown Pittsburgh</a> as the <a>Rachel Carson Bridge</a>.  The naming resolution was passed by <a>Allegheny County</a> Council on December 6, 2005.  The Rachel Carson Bridge is one of the &quot;Three Sisters&quot; Bridges, opened between 1926 and 1928, and designed by County architect Stanley L. Roush and the Allegheny County Department of Public Works. The <a>Roberto Clemente Bridge</a> (formerly Sixth Street Bridge) and the <a>Andy Warhol Bridge</a> (formerly Seventh Street Bridge) complete the trio of bridges. They are the only trio of nearly identical bridges and were the first self-anchored suspension spans built in the United States. They are among the only surviving examples of large eyebar chain suspension bridges in the country.</p>
