<p>[[Image:Sparty.jpg|thumb|right|290px|Sparty at a baseball game between Michigan State and the [[Lansing Lugnuts]] in 2007.]] <strong>Sparty</strong> is the <a>mascot</a> of <a>Michigan State University</a>. Sparty is usually depicted as a muscular male <a>Sparta</a>n warrior/athlete dressed in stylized <a>Greek</a> costume. After changing the team name from &quot;<a>Aggies</a>&quot; to &quot;Spartans&quot; in 1925, various incarnations of a Spartan warrior with a prominent chin appeared at university events and in university literature. In 1943, MSU art professor <a>Leonard D. Jungwirth</a> designed a statue for the university, which had to be cast in <a>terra cotta</a> because of <a>World War II</a> rationing. In 2005, the university replaced Jungwirth's original statue with a bronze replica, moving the original indoors to protect it from the elements.</p>
<p>Sparty appears in several other incarnations. In printed literature, the university uses a copyrighted <a>cartoon</a> Spartan, usually drawn with a grimace and several days worth of whiskers, lending the nickname of &quot;Gruff&quot; Sparty. Finally, Sparty appears as a <a>foam rubber</a> mascot with an oversized head. The mascot costume, worn by an anonymous student, appears at most university sporting, alumni, and <a>fundraising</a> events; he is often portrayed in MSU notices and materials.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Though MSU is now a large university, in the 19th century it was a small <a>agricultural</a> college known as the State Agricultural College of Michigan. Thus, when the college fielded its first intercollegiate sports teams in the 1880s, the teams were appropriately named the <a>Aggies</a>. By 1925, the school had expanded beyond agriculture, becoming Michigan State College of Agriculture and Applied Science. To reduce the emphasis on agriculture, the college held a contest to choose a new team name. The chosen entry was the &quot;Michigan Staters.&quot;  George S. Alderton, then sports editor of the <em><a>Lansing State Journal</a></em>, and Dale Stafford, sportswriter for the <em>Lansing Capitol News</em>, felt the name was too unwieldy for newspaper headlines and searched the contest entries for a better choice. They settled on the &quot;<a>Spartans</a>&quot;, a name submitted by former Aggie athlete Perry J. Fremont. Alderton and Stafford began using the name in their game accounts, and it soon caught on as the <em><a>de facto</a></em> team name. Michigan State's teams have been the Spartans ever since.</p>
<h2>Costumed mascot</h2>
<p>[[Image:Sparty the Mascot.jpg|thumb|right|290px|Sparty at a football game between [[Michigan State University|Michigan State]] and <a>Notre Dame</a> in 2009.]] While MSU students and <a>alumni</a> often refer to the <em>Spartan</em> statue as Sparty, the incarnation of Sparty with national visibility is that of a <a>costume</a>d <a>mascot</a> who appears at athletic events and other university-related functions.  The costume, with a <a>cartoon</a>ishly oversized <a>head</a>, bulging <a>muscle</a>s, and a facial expression that treads a fine line between cute and pugnacious, was introduced to MSU fans during the 1989 <a>football</a> season.  Sparty was an immediate hit, in part because the foam-rubber body parts and vinyl breastplate have a freedom of movement that allow the <a>anonymous</a> student who portrays Sparty to be quite expressive despite the costume's fixed stare. The student that portrays Sparty is a volunteer, despite rumors of financial compensation or a full scholarship.</p>
<p><a>thumb|250px|left|Sparty on the NCAA 09 for Wii cover.</a> Sparty came to national prominence in the mid-1990s with his appearance in <a>a series of television ads</a> promoting <a>ESPN</a>'s <em><a>Sports Center</a></em>. One advertisement depicted Sparty carrying gymnast <a>Kerri Strug</a> in the manner of <em><a>Beauty and the Beast</a></em>&mdash;or, more to the point, <a>B&#x00e9;la K&#x00e1;rolyi</a>, who carried the injured Strug to the medal platform to accept <a>her team gold medal</a> at the <a>1996 Summer Olympics</a>. He also appeared in ESPN ads with background cameos, such as eating in a <a>diner</a> booth or browsing the shelves of a bookstore. In 2004, Sparty won the Best Mascot National Championship at the Universal <a>Cheer</a> Association/Universal Dance Association College Nationals, becoming the first <a>Big Ten Conference</a> mascot to do so. He won Best Mascot for the second year in a row after securing the honor again the following year. In addition to his title of &quot;best mascot,&quot; Sparty was voted the &quot;Buffest Mascot&quot; by <em><a>Muscle and Fitness</a></em> magazine. Sparty was even found in the refrigerators of local stores and many alumni when Sparty was featured on a series of <a>Jones Soda</a> bottles in late 2004, and he appeared again in 2005. Sparty was one of six college mascots nominated for the <a>Mascot Hall of Fame</a> in July 2006. In the summer of 2006, <a>Alltel Wireless</a> aired a commercial featuring ESPN's <a>Lee Corso</a> and Sparty.</p>
<p>Three years after winning top honors for the first time, Sparty was again named best mascot. It was Sparty's third title in just four years. His skit, &quot;Sparty's Spectacular,&quot; featured music from many different genres, including <a>rock</a>, <a>country</a>, and <a>Riverdance</a>. To qualify for nationals, Sparty submitted a video showcasing his performances at athletic events and community service events.</p>
<p>Sparty appears on the cover of the <a>Wii</a> version of <em><a>NCAA Football 09</a></em>, the first time a non-athlete has graced the cover. <a>EA Sports</a> had a poll to see which mascot would grace the cover, and Sparty won by over 75,000 votes.</p>
<h2>Statues</h2>
<p> When <a>John Hannah</a> became president of Michigan State College in 1941, he commissioned <a>assistant professor</a> of <a>art</a> Leonard D. Jungwirth to design a statue of an athletic Spartan warrior. Jungwirth sculpted a statue known simply as <em>The Spartan</em>, which soon gained the nickname of &quot;Sparty&quot;. Though Jungwirth originally designed <em>The Spartan</em> as a <a>bronze</a> statue, it had to be cast in <a>terra cotta</a> due to <a>World War II</a> <a>rationing</a> of bronze. These pieces were joined by <a>mortar</a> joints, with a poured <a>concrete</a> core over a <a>steel</a> frame. The statue stands 9&#x2019;&nbsp;7&quot; high and weighs approximately 3,000&nbsp;pounds. When the statue was erected, popular media claimed that it was the tallest free-standing ceramic sculpture in the world, While annual repair work helped stem the damage done by precipitation, extreme cold, and vandalism, the statue needed more intensive repair.</p>
<p>[[Image:MSU Bronze Sparty 1.jpg|thumb|355px|left|<em>The Spartan</em> in [[bronze]].]] In 1989, the Save Our Sparty (SOS) campaign helped restore the statue. When they finished, restorers made fiberglass molds of the refurbished &quot;Sparty&quot;. New molds were made in 2004, because the 1989 molds had deteriorated, to cast an identical <a>bronze</a> replica that will better stand up to bad weather and vandalism.</p>
<p>The terra cotta <em>Spartan</em> was removed from its base on May 12, 2005. During MSU's 2005 summer <a>semester</a>, the intersection at which the statue stood was completely redesigned to allow for safer <a>traffic</a> interaction with <a>pedestrians</a>. On Thursday, August 25, 2005, an unveiling of the new bronze <em>Spartan</em> took place. In addition, a <a>Sesquicentennial</a> parade on Saturday, October 8, 2005, concluded with a dedication ceremony at the statue. Meanwhile, the original terra cotta <em>Spartan</em> was moved to a new <a>Spartan Stadium</a> annex where it could be displayed safely indoors. Though most members of the MSU community agree that the original statue needs to be sheltered, some alumni and faculty have criticized the inaccessibility of the original statue.</p>
<h3>Traditions</h3>
<p>It is tradition for some alumni and other Spartan fans to have a picture taken with the <em>Spartan</em> statue to mark major life events. After the final home football game the Spartan Marching Band circles the statue three times before heading home to Adams Field.</p>
