<p>Founded in 1831, <strong>Denison University</strong> is a private, coeducational, and residential <a>college</a> of <a>liberal arts</a> and <a>sciences</a>. Denison University is located in <a>Granville, Ohio</a>, approximately 30 miles (50&nbsp;km) east of <a>Columbus</a>, the state capital. It is a member of the <a>Five Colleges of Ohio</a>, the <a>Great Lakes Colleges Association</a>, and the <a>North Coast Athletic Conference</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Founding &amp; Early Years</h3>
<p><a>thumb|400px|right|A view of Swasey Chapel from the west</a> On December 13, 1831, <a>John Pratt</a>, the college's first president and a graduate of Brown University, inaugurated classes at the Granville Literary and Theological Institution. Situated on a 200-acre farm south of the village of Granville, it was the first Baptist college west of the Allegheny mountains. While rooted in theological education, the institution submitted students to the same literary and scientific instruction common to other colleges of the day. The first term included 37 students, 27 of whom hailed from Granville; nearly half of these students were under fifteen years of age. The school's first Commencement, which graduated three classical scholars, was held in 1840.</p>
<p>In 1845, the institution, which at this point was male-only, officially changed its name to Granville College. In 1853, William S. Denison, a Muskingum County farmer, pledged $10,000 toward the college's endowment. Honoring an earlier commitment, the trustees accordingly changed the name of the institution to Denison University. They also voted to move the college to land then available for purchase in the village of Granville. </p>
<p>In the years leading up to the Civil War, many students and faculty members at Denison University became heavily involved in the anti-slavery movement. Professor Asa Drury, the chair of Greek and Latin studies, became the leader of a local anti-slavery society, while Bancroft House, now a residential hall, served as a stop on the Underground Railroad.</p>
<h3>Expansion</h3>
<p>The roots of coeducation at Denison University began in December 1832 with the establishment of the Granville Female Seminary, founded by <a>Charles Sawyer</a> a year before Oberlin launched the first coeducational college in the United States. The seminary was superseded by the Young Ladies' Institute, founded in 1859 by Dr. and Mrs. Nathan S. Burton. The Young Ladies' Institute was sold to Reverend Dr. Daniel Shepardson in 1868 and was renamed the Shepardson College for Women in 1886. Shepardson College was incorporated as part of Denison University in 1900, with the two colleges becoming fully consolidated in 1927.</p>
<p>In 1887, Denison inaugurated a master's program, with resident graduates pursuing advanced studies in the sciences. Within a few years, the institution considered offering graduate programs on the doctoral level. In 1926, the Board of Trustees formalized a new curriculum that would make Denison University an exclusively undergraduate institution.  </p>
<p>In the wake of Shepardson College's incorporation, Denison University made plans for enlargement of its campus. In 1916, the college sought the expertise of the Frederick Law Olmsted &amp; Sons architectural firm, the founder of which had designed Central Park in New York City. The resulting &quot;Olmstead Plan&quot; laid a foundation for expansion that has remained the guiding aesthetic for subsequent growth, establishing and maintaining a pedestrian-friendly campus, while also preserving scenic views of the surrounding hills and valleys. Expansion during this period included the acquisiton of land to the north and east, the transfer of Shepardson College to the east ridge of College Hill, and the development of a new men's quadrangle beyond the library.</p>
<h3>Recent History</h3>
<p>While the college's origins were rooted in theological education, Denison University has been a non-sectarian institution since the 1960s. By 1970, the college reached its present size of approximately 2,000 students.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>The campus size is about 900 acres (4&nbsp;km&#x00b2;).  This includes a 550 acre (1.4&nbsp;km&#x00b2;) biological reserve just east of campus, where professors of sciences like <a>geology</a> and <a>biology</a> can hold class. Notable landmarks include the following:</p>
<h3>Swasey Chapel</h3>
<p>The first building in the ambitious &quot;Greater Denison&quot; plan, Swasey Chapel, Denison&#x2019;s signature building, stands at the center of the campus.  The chapel seats 990 and plays host to notable campus events such as baccalaureate services, lectures, concerts, and academic award convocations.</p>
<h3>William Howard Doane Library</h3>
<p>Built in 1937, Doane Library today houses more than 400,000 books and bound periodicals.</p>
<h3>Swasey Observatory</h3>
<p>Swasey Observatory, which opened in June 1910, houses a 9-inch refracting telescope as well as two 8-inch reflecting telescopes.</p>
<h3>Bryant Arts Center</h3>
<p>The Bryant Arts Center opened in August 2009. The building originally was constructed in 1904 as a men's gymnasium and later became a student union; today, it is the home of the studio art and art history departments. The  facility has studios for ceramics, painting, printmaking, sculpture, photography and digital media, while also featuring fully electronic classrooms, open gallery spaces, an art history resource room, outdoor performance spaces, a common area for studio art seniors, and independent studios for faculty.</p>
<h3>Slayter Union</h3>
<p>Slayter Union features lounges, a snack bar, bookstore, student mailboxes, a 302-seat auditorium, as well as offices for student organizations.</p>
<h2>Students</h2>
<p>As of the 2010-11 school year, 2,132 students are enrolled at Denison. They come from 46 states, <a>Washington, DC</a>, and 25 countries. A full-time faculty of 212 professors makes the student-to-faculty ratio 10:1. Over the past several years, Denison University has made great strides in attracting a diverse student population, and multicultural students now represent 25 percent of the current first-year class.  The college's students, faculty and staff were honored in 2008 by the State of Ohio for &quot;promoting understanding, racial unity and the appreciation of diversity.&quot;</p>
<p>The university currently has a 49% acceptance rate; out of 4,720 applicants for the class of 2014, 2,328 were accepted and 625 enrolled.</p>

<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p><a>400px|right|thumb|A view of Deeds Field-Piper Stadium from College Hill</a> Denison is a member of the <a>NCAA</a> and the <a>North Coast Athletic Conference</a> (NCAC).  Denison participates as a Division III institution which prohibits athletic scholarships.  Denison has won nine (9) consecutive NCAC All-Sports Championships for a total of ten (10) since the founding of the conference in 1984-85. Denison's other All Sports Championship came in 1985-86, and both the consecutive championships streak and the total of ten represent conference records.</p>
<p>The most successful teams are led by the Men's and Women's Swimming programs.  In 2001, the women won the NCAA Division III national championship, unseating perennial champion and local rival<a>Kenyon College</a>.  In 2006, 2007, and 2010 the men placed 2nd in the nation; the women's and men's teams each finished in 3rd in the nation in 2008 and again in 2009. Plans are currently underway to expand Denison's athletic facility to include a new state of the art natatorium. The squash program is also a perennial national contender.  Other top ranked programs include lacrosse, soccer, baseball, softball, and women's tennis. The Denison women's tennis team finished their 2008 season ranked 3rd in the country. Also, for the first time in school history their #1 doubles team made it all the way to the championship match in the individual national competition. The women's softball team had a record breaking season in the spring of 2008 also. They advanced farther in the NCAA tournament than any other team has since softball became a varsity sport at Denison in 1997. They competed in the regional final against Muskingum College in Glassboro, NJ. and in the final D3 season rankings the softball team was ranked 22nd in the nation. The lacrosse and soccer games against <a>Ohio Wesleyan University</a> are the most widely attended <a>&quot;rivalry&quot; games</a>.  Also, the Kenyon/Denison swimming rivalry is recognized in small-college sports.</p>
<p><a>Woody Hayes</a>, later renowned as the head coach at <a>Ohio State University</a>, graduated from Denison in 1935, having served as captain of the football team the previous fall, and served as the university's head football coach from 1946 to 1948.</p>
<h2>Greek Life</h2>
<p>Denison has seven fraternities and five sororities.  Fewer students are currently participating in Greek life than they have historically. In the 1980s, over 60% of the student body belonged to a Greek organization.  Currently, Greek participation by students is about 40%, with more women participating than men. Greek organizations are governed by an <a>Interfraternity Council</a> and <a>Panhellenic Council</a>.</p>
<p>During the mid-1990s, in an effort to re-brand the college as more of an academic, and less of a party, institution, the college's trustees and then-President Michele Tolela Myers elected to make Denison a &quot;non-residential&quot; Greek system.  The decision led to student and alumni uproar, with a low-grade riot erupting on the campus' &quot;Fraternity Row&quot; as a result.  The decision turned most of the formerly-residential fraternity houses into general college residential halls, and each chapter was given lounge space in the basement of each respective house for official fraternity functions (including chapter meetings). The change to a non-residential Greek system, combined with a reduction in the number of fraternities, accounts for most of the reduction in the student Greek participation between the current and historic levels.</p>
<p>The fraternities are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>Alpha Phi Alpha</a></li>
  <li><a>Beta Theta Pi</a></li>
  <li><a>Delta Chi</a></li>
  <li><a>Kappa Sigma</a> (Colony)</li>
  <li><a>Lambda Chi Alpha</a></li>
  <li><a>Phi Beta Sigma</a></li>
  <li><a>Phi Delta Theta</a></li>
  <li><a>Phi Iota Alpha</a> (Colony)</li>
  <li><a>Sigma Chi</a></li>
  <li><a>Sigma Phi Epsilon</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The sororities are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>Alpha Kappa Alpha</a></li>
  <li><a>Delta Delta Delta</a></li>
  <li><a>Delta Gamma</a></li>
  <li><a>Delta Sigma Theta</a></li>
  <li><a>Kappa Kappa Gamma</a></li>
  <li><a>Kappa Alpha Theta</a></li>
  <li><a>Pi Beta Phi</a></li>
  <li><a>Sigma Lambda Gamma</a> (Colony)</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of the former residential Fraternity Houses have been converted to other uses and tastefully remodelled.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Delta Upsilon house became Taylor House, an &quot;honors&quot; residence hall</li>
  <li>The Delta Chi house became Sunset House</li>
  <li>The Lambda Chi Alpha house became the Erma and Clark Morrow House, an all-first-year student &quot;living and learning&quot; residence hall</li>
  <li>The S. S. Chamberlin Lodge of Phi Gamma Delta became the Chamberlin House</li>
  <li>The Phi Delta Theta house became the Preston House</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these former houses, such as the Beta Theta Pi House, Sigma Chi House, and Kappa Sigma House, are still owned by national fraternities and rented to the college.</p>
<h2>Traditions &amp; Folklore</h2>
<h3>D-Day</h3>
<p>D-Day, the successor to the college's old Scrap Day, is a celebration of the entire college, held twice a year.</p>
<h3>Mt. Denison</h3>
<p>Kirtley Mather, Class of 1909, named the tallest peak in Alaska's Aleutian Peninsula &quot;Mt. Denison.&quot; In 1978, a group of students, professors, and alumni successfully scaled the mountain&#x2014;a feat repeated nearly 20 years later by another Denison group.</p>
<h3>College Cemetery</h3>
<p>Denison has one of the few remaining college cemeteries in Ohio. Among those buried on Sunset Hill are Jonathan Going, the college's second president, and <a>Elisha Andrews</a>, its sixth.</p>
