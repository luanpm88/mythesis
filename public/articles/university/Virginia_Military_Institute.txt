<p> The <strong>Virginia Military Institute</strong> (<strong>VMI</strong>), located in <a>Lexington, Virginia</a>, is the oldest <a>state-supported</a> <a>military college</a> and one of six <a>senior military colleges</a> in the <a>United States</a>.  Unlike any other military college in the United States&#x2014;and in keeping with its founding principles&#x2014;all VMI students are military cadets pursuing bachelor degrees.  VMI offers cadets a spartan, physically demanding environment combined with strict military discipline.  VMI offers degrees in fourteen different disciplines in Engineering, the Sciences and the Liberal Arts.  Although VMI has been called the &quot;<a>West Point</a> of the South,&quot; it differs from the <a>federal service academies</a> in several respects. For example, while all VMI cadets must participate in the <a>Reserve Officers' Training Corps</a> (ROTC), they are not required to serve in the military upon graduation. Instead, VMI graduates may either accept a <a>commission</a> in any of the <a>US military branches</a> or pursue civilian endeavors upon graduation.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Early history</h3>
<p>On 11 November 1839 the Virginia Military Institute was founded on the site of the Lexington state <a>arsenal</a> and the first Cadets relieved personnel on duty. Under <a>Major General</a> <a>Francis Henney Smith</a>, <a>superintendent</a>, and <a>Colonel</a> <a>Claudius Crozet</a>, president of the Board of Visitors, the <a>Corps</a> was imbued with the <a>discipline</a> and the spirit for which it is famous. The first cadet to march a sentinel post was <a>Private</a> John Strange. With few exceptions, there have been sentinels posted at VMI every hour of every day of the school year.</p>
<p>The Class of 1842 graduated 16 cadets. Living conditions were poor until 1850 when the cornerstone of the new <a>barracks</a> was laid. In 1851 <a>Thomas &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson</a> became a member of the faculty and <a>professor</a> of <a>Natural and Experimental Philosophy</a>. Under then-Major Jackson and Major <a>William Gilham</a>, VMI <a>infantry</a> and <a>artillery</a> units were present at the <a>execution</a> by <a>hanging</a> of <a>John Brown</a> at <a>Charles Town</a>, <a>Virginia</a> (now <a>West Virginia</a>) in 1859.</p>
<h3>Civil War period</h3>
<p>The Institute played a valuable part in the training of the Southern armies and participated as a unit in actual battles. VMI cadets were called into active military service on 14 different occasions during the <a>American Civil War</a> and many cadets, under the leadership of General Stonewall Jackson, were sent to Camp Lee, at <a>Richmond</a>, to train recruits. VMI alumni were regarded among the best officers of the South and several distinguished themselves in the <a>Union</a> forces as well. Fifteen graduates rose to the rank of general in the Confederate Army, and one rose to this rank in the Union Army. Just before the <a>Battle of Chancellorsville</a> Stonewall Jackson said, &quot;The Institute will be heard from today.&quot; He was commenting on the leadership provided by VMI alumni in his Corps. Three of Jackson's four Division commanders at Chancellorsville, Generals <a>James Lane</a>, <a>Robert Rodes</a>, and <a>Raleigh Colston</a>, were VMI graduates as were a significant number of his field grade officers.</p>
<p>On 15 May 1864 VMI cadets fought as an independent unit at the <a>Battle of New Market</a>. VMI is the only military college or academy in the United States to hold this distinction. The cadets who fought that day ranged in age from 14 to 22, though through the years, claims have been made of cadets as young as 12 fighting. General <a>John C. Breckinridge</a>, the commanding Southern general, held the cadets in reserve and did not use them until Union troops broke through the Confederate lines. Upon seeing the tide of battle turning in favor of the Union forces, Breckinridge stated, &quot;Put the boys in...and may God forgive me for the order.&quot; The VMI cadets held the line and eventually pushed forward, capturing a Union artillery emplacement, securing victory for the Confederates. The Union troops were withdrawn and Confederate troops under General Breckinridge held the Shenandoah Valley. VMI suffered fifty-two casualties with eight cadets killed in action,two who died of their wounds shortly after the battle and forty-two wounded. The cadets were led into battle by Commandant of Cadets and future VMI Superintendent Colonel <a>Scott Shipp</a>. Shipp was also wounded during the battle. Six of the ten fallen cadets are buried on VMI grounds behind the statue, &quot;Virginia Mourning Her Dead&quot; by sculptor <a>Moses Ezekiel</a>, a VMI graduate who was also wounded in the Battle of New Market.</p>
<p>On 12 June 1864 Union forces under the command of General <a>David Hunter</a> shelled and burned the Institute as part of the <a>Valley Campaigns of 1864</a>. The destruction was almost complete and VMI had to temporarily hold classes at the Alms House in <a>Richmond, Virginia</a>. In April 1865 Richmond was evacuated due to the impending fall of Petersburg and the VMI Corps of Cadets was disbanded. The Lexington campus reopened for classes on 17 October 1865. One of the reasons that Confederate General <a>Jubal A. Early</a> burned the town of <a>Chambersburg, Pennsylvania</a> was in retaliation for the shelling of VMI. Following the war, <a>Matthew Fontaine Maury</a>, the pioneering <a>oceanographer</a> known as the &quot;Pathfinder of the Seas&quot;, accepted a teaching position at VMI, holding the <a>physics</a> chair.</p>
<h3>World War II</h3>
<p>VMI produced some of America's most significant commanders in World War II. The most important of these was <a>George C. Marshall</a>, the top U.S. Army general during the war. Marshall was the Army's first <a>five star general</a> and the only career military officer ever to win the <a>Nobel Peace Prize</a>. <a>Winston Churchill</a> dubbed Marshall the &quot;Architect of Victory&quot; and &quot;the greatest Roman of them all&quot;. The Deputy Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army during the war was also a VMI graduate as were the Second U.S. Army commander, 15th U.S. Army commander, the commander of Allied Air Forces of the Southwest Pacific and various Corps and Division commanders in the Army and Marine Corps. China's General <a>Sun Li-jen</a>, known as the &quot;Rommel of the East&quot;, was also a graduate of the VMI.</p>
<p>During the war, VMI participated in the <a>War Department</a>'s Army Specialized Training Program (ASTP) from 1943 to 1946. The program provided training in engineering and related subjects to <a>enlisted</a> men at colleges across the United States. Over 2,100 ASTP members studied at VMI during the war.</p>
<h3>Superintendents</h3>
<p>Since 1839, VMI has had fourteen superintendents. Francis H. Smith was the first and the longest serving, filling the position for 50 years. Only three of the fourteen superintendents were not graduates of VMI.</p>

<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>The VMI campus covers , 12 of which are designated as the <a>Virginia Military Institute Historic District</a>, listed on the <a>National Register of Historic Places</a>. The campus is referred to as the &quot;Post.&quot; A training area of several hundred additional acres is located near the Post. All cadets are housed on campus in a large five-story building, called the &quot;barracks.&quot; The <a>Old Barracks</a>, which has been designated a <a>National Historic Landmark</a>, stands on the site of the old arsenal. The new wing of the barracks (&quot;New Barracks&quot;) was completed in 1949. The two wings surround two quadrangles connected by a <a>sally port</a>. All rooms open onto porch-like stoops facing one of the quadrangles. A third barracks wing was completed, with cadets moving in officially spring semester 2009. Four of the Five arched entries into the barracks are named for <a>George Washington</a>, <a>Thomas &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson</a>, <a>George C. Marshall '01</a> and <a>Jonathan Daniels '61</a>. Next to the Barracks are offices and meeting areas for VMI clubs and organizations, the cadet visitors center and lounge, a snack bar, and a <a>Barnes &amp; Noble</a>-operated bookstore.</p>
<p>VMI is continuing with significant construction projects under the &quot;Vision 2039&quot; program. Under this capital campaign, VMI's alumni and supporters raised over $275 million over three years. The Barracks are being expanded to house 1,500 cadets, all academic buildings are being renovated and modernized, and VMI is spending an additional $200 million to build the VMI Center for Leadership and Ethics. The new Leadership Center will be used by VMI cadets, <a>Washington and Lee University</a> students, and other students throughout the country and abroad to develop leadership abilities combined with a focus on integrity and honor to benefit tomorrow's world. The Center will also be home to VMI's Distinguished Speaker Series and its Leadership Symposia. The funding will also support &quot;study abroad&quot; programs including joint ventures with <a>Oxford</a> and <a>Cambridge</a> Universities in England and many other universities.</p>
<h2>Academic programs</h2>
<p>VMI's academic programs are grouped into four areas: Engineering, Liberal Arts, Humanities, and the Sciences. The Engineering department has concentrations in three areas: Civil and Environmental Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering. Two recent <a>Chiefs of Engineers</a> of the <a>Army Corps of Engineers</a>, Lieutenant Generals <a>Carl A. Strock</a> and <a>Robert B. Flowers</a>, were VMI Engineering graduates. VMI offers 14 major and 22 minor areas of study, with the majority of classes taught by full-time <a>professor</a>s, 96 percent of whom hold terminal degrees.</p>
<p>The scholarly achievements of VMI cadets and alumni are significant. A strikingly large number of graduates go on to attend graduate and professional schools. VMI has produced more Rhodes Scholars than all other senior military colleges (Va. Tech, the Citadel, Texas A&amp;M, Norwich University and North Georgia College and State University) combined and has graduated more Rhodes Scholars per graduate than any state college or university in the United States. VMI has graduated 11 Rhodes Scholars since 1921 and 2 in the last six years. The most recent VMI Rhodes Scholar (as of 2009), Gregory Lippiatt, was named in 2009.&lt;!--feel free to supplant/supplement from here --&gt; In 2007, VMI had two Rhodes Scholarship finalists and one <a>Marshall Scholarship</a> finalist.</p>
<h2>Rankings</h2>
<h3>Academic</h3>
<p>In 2009 VMI ranked third, after the <a>United States Naval Academy</a> and the <a>United States Military Academy</a>, in the <em><a>US News and World Report</a></em> rankings of the 27 top public <a>liberal arts college</a>s in the United States.  There is some question as to whether or not the service academies should be rated in competition with colleges that are not fully funded with U.S. government appropriated funds. Compared to the top US liberal arts colleges, public and private, VMI ranked 62nd out of 122 (including ties) in the top tier of schools.</p>
<p>Also for 2009, <em>US News</em> ranked VMI's Civil Engineering program seventh, its Mechanical Engineering program 14th, and its overall Engineering program improved from 25th in the United States in 2008 to 21st out of 105 in the 2009 category of &quot;Best Undergraduate Engineering Programs (where doctorate is not offered).&quot; In the newly-added 2009 category of &quot;High School Counselor Rankings of Liberal Arts Colleges,&quot; VMI is ranked 57th of the 266 best liberal arts colleges.</p>
<p><a>Forbes</a>' 2008 Special Report on America's Best Colleges ranked VMI in the top 10 Public Universities in the Nation, well ahead of any other Senior Military College in the country. VMI was ranked 9th in the &quot;Top 25 Publics&quot; section, just behind the United States Military Academy, the <a>Air Force Academy</a>, and the Naval Academy, but ahead of such schools as <a>UCLA</a>, the <a>University of Michigan</a>, the <a>University of Florida</a>, the <a>U.S. Coast Guard Academy</a>, and the <a>U.S. Merchant Marine Academy</a>. Overall, VMI ranked 108th out of the 569 colleges and universities evaluated.</p>
<p><a>Kiplinger's</a> magazine, in its ranking of the &quot;Best Values in Public Colleges&quot; for 2006, made mention of the Virginia Military Institute as a &quot;great value&quot;, although the military nature of its program excluded it from consideration as a traditional four-year college in the rankings.</p>
<p>VMI has also produced 11 <a>Rhodes Scholars</a> since 1921, with the two most recent having been selected in 2003 and 2008. , VMI's current endowment of over $343,516,000 is the largest per-capita endowment of any public college in the United States. 35.4 percent of the approximately 12,300 living alumni gave in 2006. Private support constitutes more than 31 percent VMI's operating budget, as compared with 26 percent from state funds.</p>
<h2>Students</h2>
<p>Prospective cadets must be between 16 and 22 years of age. They must be unmarried, physically fit for enrollment in the <a>Reserve Officer Training Corps</a> (ROTC) and be graduates of an accredited <a>secondary school</a> or have completed an approved homeschool curriculum. New cadets at VMI have an average <a>high school</a> <a>GPA</a> of 3.39 and a mean SAT score of approximately 1140.</p>
<p>Eligibility is not restricted to Virginia residents, although it is more difficult to gain an appointment as a non-resident, because VMI has a goal that no more than 45 percent of cadets come from outside Virginia. Virginia residents receive a discount in <a>tuition</a>, as is common at most state-sponsored schools. Total tuition, room &amp; board and other fees for the 2008-2009 school year is approximately $17,000 for Virginia residents and $34,000 for all others. These fees can be misleading, because VMI's endowment enables VMI to meet a substantial amount of a cadets's financial need before the cadet needs loans.</p>
<p>Of the 1251 students enrolled in 2005, 66 were <a>African-American</a>, 39 were <a>Asian</a>, 34 were <a>Hispanic</a> and 71 were women.  Of 446 students that <a>matriculated</a> in August 2008, 39 were women. The first <a>Jew</a>ish cadet, <a>Moses Jacob Ezekiel</a>, graduated in 1866. While at VMI, Ezekiel fought with the VMI cadets at the <a>Battle of New Market</a>. He became a sculptor and his works are on display at VMI. One of the first Asian cadets was <a>Sun Li-jen</a>, the Chinese <a>National Revolutionary Army</a> general, who graduated in 1927. The first African-American cadets were admitted in 1968. The first African-American regimental commander was Darren McDew, class of 1982. McDew is currently a <a>US Air Force</a> <a>major general</a> and vice-commander of the <a>Eighteenth Air Force</a> at <a>Scott Air Force Base</a>. It is unknown when the first <a>Muslim</a> cadet graduated from VMI, but before the <a>Iranian Revolution</a>, under <a>Shah</a> <a>Mohammad Reza Pahlavi</a>, several Persian cadets attended and graduated from VMI. Other Muslim graduates have included Cadets from Bangladesh, Jordan, Indonesia and other nations.</p>
<p>VMI has traditionally enrolled cadets from the <a>armed forces of Thailand</a> and the <a>Republic of China</a> (Taiwan). Graduates have gone on to pursue graduate degrees after VMI at prestigious universities throughout the United States before returning to their countries to continue their military service. Several graduates reached general and flag officer ranks. During the 1990s many other nations were represented in the Corps of Cadets, including Great Britain, <a>Bangladesh</a>, <a>Finland</a>, <a>Botswana</a>, <a>Germany</a>, <a>Kenya</a>, <a>South Korea</a>, <a>Indonesia</a>, and <a>Japan</a>. Gregory E. Lippiatt '09 of York, PA was chosen as VMI's eleventh <a>Rhodes Scholar</a> in 2009.</p>
<h3>Admission of women</h3>
<p>VMI was the last US military college to admit women. VMI excluded <a>women</a> from the Corps of Cadets until 1997. In 1990 the <a>US Department of Justice</a> filed a discrimination lawsuit against VMI for its all-male admissions policy. While the court challenge was pending, a state-sponsored <a>Virginia Women's Institute for Leadership</a> (VWIL) was opened at <a>Mary Baldwin College</a> in <a>Staunton, Virginia</a>, as a parallel program for women. The VWIL continued, even after VMI's admission of women.</p>
<p>After VMI won its case in <a>US District Court</a>, the case went through several appeals until June 26, 1996, when the <a>US Supreme Court</a>, in a 7-1 decision in <em><a>United States v. Virginia</a></em>, found that it was unconstitutional for a school supported by public funds to exclude women. (Justice <a>Clarence Thomas</a> <a>recuse</a>d himself, presumably because his son was attending VMI at the time.) Following the ruling, VMI contemplated going private to exempt itself from the <a>14th Amendment</a>, and thus avoid the ruling.</p>
<p>Assistant Secretary of Defense Frederick F.Y. Pang, however, warned the school that the <a>Department of Defense</a> would withdraw <a>ROTC</a> programs from the school if privatization took place. As a result of this action by Pang, Congress passed a resolution on November 18, 1997 prohibiting the Department of Defense from withdrawing or diminishing any ROTC program at one of the six <a>senior military colleges</a>, including VMI. This escape clause provided by Congress came after the VMI Board of Visitors had already voted 8-7 to admit women and the decision was not revisited.</p>
<p>In August 1997, VMI enrolled its first <a>female</a> cadets. The first co-ed class consisted of thirty women, and matriculated as part of the class of 2001. In order to accelerate VMI's matriculation process several women were allowed to transfer directly from various junior colleges, such as <a>New Mexico Military Institute</a> (NMMI), and forgo the traditional four year curriculum that most cadets had been subjected to. The first female cadets &quot;walked the stage&quot; in 1999, although by VMI's definitions they are considered to be members of the class of 2001. Initially, these 30 women who were held to the same strict physical courses and technical training as the male cadets until it became apparent that adjustments to the standards had to be made. VMI resisted following other military colleges in adopting &quot;gender-normed&quot; physical training standards until 2008 when it was listed as a goal in VMI's 2039 Strategic Plan.  On June 30, 2008, gender-normed training standards were implemented for all female cadets. Female Rats are required to maintain a short haircut of approximately four inches or less and are forbidden to wear <a>makeup</a> or <a>jewelry</a>.</p>
<h3>Student life</h3>
<p><a>thumb|alt=The Regimental Commander gives commands during a parade. text|The Regimental Commander gives commands to the Corps of Cadets during a parade in coatee.</a> Just as cadets did nearly two hundred years ago, today's cadets forswear such comforts as beds, instead lying upon cots colloquially referred to as &quot;hays&quot;. These hays, aired every Monday, are little more than foam mats that must be rolled every morning.  Further, cadet uniforms have little changed; the coatee, worn in parades, dates back to  the war of 1812.  New cadets, Rats, experience even further deprivations, being unable to watch TV or listen to music or use the telephone outside the presence of their dyke.</p>
<h3>Ratline</h3>
<p>New freshmen, known as &quot;Rats&quot; and collectively as the &quot;Rat Mass&quot;, walk along a prescribed line in <a>barracks</a> while maintaining an exaggerated form of attention, called &quot;straining&quot;.  This experience, called the Rat Line, is intended by the upper classes to instill brotherhood, pride, and discipline into the incoming class.  Under this system, the Rats face mental and physical challenges, starting with &quot;Cadre Week&quot;. During Cadre Week, Rats receive basic military instruction from select upper classmen (&quot;Cadre&quot;); they learn to march, they learn to clean their <a>M-14 rifle</a>, and they learn how to wear their uniforms.  During Cadre Week, Rats also meet the members of various cadet-run organizations and learn the functions of each.  Most notable of these is the Honor Court.  By the end of the week, the new Rat Mass has significantly less hair than before and the Rats are on their way to becoming full-fledged cadets.</p>
<p>At the end of the first week, it is quite clear that the Rats have just begun. At this point, each Rat is paired with a first classman (<a>senior</a>) who serves as their mentor for the rest of the first year. The first classman is called a &quot;Dyke&quot;, reference to an older Southern pronunciation of &quot;to deck out&quot;, or to get into a uniform. While the Dyke watches out for the Rat and the Rat works for the Dyke in accordance with Institute policy, Cadre still enforce all rules as the Rats. In combining the softness of the Dykes with the hardness of the system they lead, with countless push-ups, sweat parties, and runs, the Rats are instilled with the virtue of time management and attention to detail.</p>
<p>The Ratline experience culminates with Resurrection Week ending in &quot;Breakout&quot;, an event where the Rats are formally &quot;welcomed&quot; to the VMI community. After the successful completion of Breakout, Rats are officially fourth class students and no longer have to strain in the barracks or eat &quot;square meals&quot;. Many versions of the Breakout ceremony have been conducted. In the 1950s Rats from each company would be packed into a corner room in the barracks and brawl their way out through the upperclassmen. From the late 1960s through the early 1980s the Rats had to fight their way up to the fourth level of the barracks through three other classes of cadets determined not to let them get to the top. The stoops would often be slick with motor oil, packed with snow, glazed with ice, greased, or continuously hosed with water. The barracks stairs and rails were not able to take the abuse, so the Corps moved the breakout to a muddy hill where Rats attempt to climb to the top by crawling on their stomachs while the upper classes block them or drag them back down. As of 2007 the Rats no longer breakout in the mud but instead participate in a grueling day of physical activity testing both physical endurance and team work.</p>
<p>The entire body of Rats during the Ratline is called a &quot;Rat Mass&quot;. Since the Rats of the Rat mass are not officially fourth classmen until after Breakout, the Rat Mass is also not officially considered a graduating class until that time either. Prior to Breakout, the Rat mass is given a different style of year identifier to emphasize this difference. The year identifier starts with the year of the current graduating class (their dykes' class), followed by a &quot;+3&quot; to indicate the anticipated year of their own class. For example, Rats that will make up the prospective Class of 2014 are considered the &quot;Rat Mass of 2011+3&quot; as the members of their dykes' class will graduate in 2011 and they themselves will graduate three years onward from then.</p>
<h3>Traditions</h3>
<p>In addition to the Ratline, VMI has other traditions that are emblematic of the school and its history including the new cadet oath ceremony, the pagentry of close-order marching, and the nightly playing of &quot;<a>Taps</a>&quot;. An event second only to <a>graduation</a> in importance is the &quot;Ring Figure&quot; dance held every November. During their junior year, cadets receive <a>class ring</a>s at a ring presentation ceremony followed by a formal dance. Most cadets get two rings, a formal ring and a combat ring; some choose to have the combat ring for everyday wear, and the formal for special occasions.</p>
<p>Every year, VMI honors its fallen cadets with a New Market Day parade and ceremony. These events take place on 15 May, the same day as the <a>Battle of New Market</a> in which the VMI cadets fought during the Civil War in 1864. During this ceremony, roll is called for cadets who &quot;died on the Field of Honor&quot; and wreaths are placed on the graves of those who died during the Battle of New Market.</p>
<p>The requirement that all cadets eat in the mess hall was the basis for a lawsuit in 2002 when two cadets sued VMI over the prayer said before dinner. The non-denominational prayer had been a daily fixture since the 1950s. In 2002 the Fourth Circuit ruled the prayer, during an event with mandatory attendance, at a state-funded school, violated the <a>US Constitution</a>. When the Supreme Court declined to review the school's appeal in April 2004, the prayer tradition was stopped.</p>
<p>The tradition of guarding the Institute is one of the longest standing and is carried out to this day. Cadets have been posted as sentinels guarding the barracks 24 hours a day, seven days a week while school is in session since the first cadet sentinel, Cadet John B. Strange, and others relieved the Virginia Militia guard team tasked with defending the Lexington Arsenal (that later became VMI) in 1839. The guard team wears the traditional school uniform and each sentinel is armed with an M-14 rifle and bayonet.</p>
<h3>Honor code</h3>
<p>VMI is known for its strict <a>honor code</a>, which is as old as the Institute and was formally codified in the early 20th century. Under the VMI Honor Code, &quot;a cadet does not lie, cheat, steal, nor tolerate those who do.&quot;</p>
<h3>Clubs and activities</h3>
<p>VMI currently offers over 50 school-sponsored clubs and organizations, including recreational activities, military organizations, musical and performance groups, religious organizations and service groups. Although VMI prohibited cadet membership in fraternal organizations starting in 1885, VMI cadets were instrumental in starting several fraternities. <a>Alpha Tau Omega</a> fraternity was founded by VMI cadets Otis Allen Glazebrook, Alfred Marshall, and Erskine Mayo Ross at <a>Richmond, Virginia</a> on September 11, 1865 while the school was closed for reconstruction.</p>
<p>After the re-opening, <a>Kappa Sigma Kappa</a> fraternity was founded by cadets on September 28, 1867 and <a>Sigma Nu</a> fraternity was founded by cadets on January 1, 1869. In a special arrangement, graduating cadets may be nominated by Kappa Alpha Order alumni and inducted into the fraternity, becoming part of <a>Kappa Alpha Order</a>'s Beta Commission (a commission as opposed to an active chapter). This occurs following graduation, and the newly-initiated VMI alumni are accepted as brothers of the fraternity.</p>
<h2>Military service</h2>
<p>As of 2006, VMI had graduated 265 <a>General Officer</a>s and <a>Flag Officer</a>s, more than any other college in the United States, except for <a>West Point</a>, <a>Annapolis</a> and the Air Force Academy. Among its most distinguished military alumni are the first five-star <a>General of the Army</a>, <a>George Marshall</a>; seven recipients of the highest <a>military decoration</a> awarded by the United States government, the <a>Medal of Honor</a>; more than 80 recipients of the second highest award, the Distinguished Service Cross/Navy Cross; and nine four-star <a>generals</a>, again, more than any other college in the United States excluding West Point, Annapolis and the Air Force Academy. VMI has graduated an Army Chief of Staff, an Air Force Chief of Staff and two Marine Corps Commandants making it the only college in the United States (including the federal service academies) to have graduated service chiefs of three of the four primary armed services. VMI offers <a>ROTC</a> programs for four US military branches (Army, Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force). While four years of ROTC is a requirement for all cadets, accepting a commission in the armed forces is optional. The VMI Board of Visitors has set a goal of having 70 percent of VMI cadets take a commission by 2015. The VMI class of 2008 achieved a 52.8 percent commissioning rate.</p>
<p>The table below lists all United States Generals (four-star) who graduated from VMI (The table does not include four-star Alumni of the Institute who attended VMI but graduated elsewhere, such as Generals Patton and Walker. Nor does the table include the many graduates of VMI who attained the rank of four star general in military service to foreign nations such as Thailand, China, and Taiwan): </p>

<p><a>right</a> VMI fields 14 teams on the <a>NCAA</a> <a>Division I</a> level (<a>FCS</a>, formerly I-AA, for football). <a>Varsity</a> sports include <a>baseball</a>, <a>basketball</a>, men's and women's <a>cross country</a>, <a>football</a>, <a>lacrosse</a>, <a>rifle</a>, men's and women's <a>soccer</a>, men's and women's <a>swimming &amp; diving</a>, men's and women's <a>track &amp; field</a>, and <a>wrestling</a>. VMI is a member of the <a>Big South</a> for almost all sports; it is an associate member of the <a>Southern Conference</a> for wrestling and the <a>MAAC</a> for lacrosse. The VMI team name is the Keydets, a Southern style slang for the word &quot;cadets&quot;.</p>
<p>VMI has the third-smallest enrollment of any FCS football college, after <a>Presbyterian</a> and <a>Wofford</a>. Approximately one-third of the Corps of Cadets plays on at least one of VMI's intercollegiate athletic teams, making it one of the most active athletic programs in the country. Of the VMI varsity athletes who complete their eligibility, 92 percent receive their VMI diplomas.</p>
<h3>Football</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|Alumni Memorial Field at Foster Stadium</a> VMI played its first football game in 1871. The one-game season was a 2-4 loss to <a>Washington and Lee University</a>. There are no records of a coach or any players for that game. VMI waited another twenty years, until 1891, when head coach <a>Walter Taylor</a> would coach the next football team. The current head football coach at VMI, <a>Sparky Woods</a>, was named the 30th head coach on February 13, 2008. The Keydets play their home games out of <a>Alumni Memorial Field at Foster Stadium</a>, built in 1962.</p>
<h3>Men's basketball</h3>
<p>Perhaps the most famous athletic story in VMI history was the two-year run of the 1976 and 1977 basketball teams. The 1976 squad advanced within one game of the <a>Final Four</a> before bowing to undefeated <a>Rutgers</a> in the <a>East Regional Final</a>, and in 1977 VMI finished with 26 wins and just four losses, still a school record, and reached the &quot;Sweet 16&quot; round of the <a>NCAA tournament</a>.</p>
<p>The current VMI basketball team is led by head coach Dugger Baucom and associate head coach Daniel Willis.</p>
