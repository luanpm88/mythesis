<p><strong>HEC Paris</strong> or <strong>&#x00c9;cole des Hautes &#x00c9;tudes Commerciales de Paris</strong> is a French <em><a>Grande Ecole</a></em>. It was established in 1881 by the <a>Paris Chamber of Commerce and Industry</a> and has become one of the world's foremost <a>business school</a>s. It has been consistently ranked the best business school in Europe by the <em><a>Financial Times</a></em> since the ranking's inception.</p>
<p>HEC is among the few <em>Grandes Ecoles</em> which educate France's top executives and political elite. It has many notable alumni in business and politics, including members of the current French government, the <a>director-general</a> of the <a>WTO</a> and the <a>IMF</a> <a>president</a>. In 2010, 10 of the 40 largest French publicly traded companies have an alumnus of HEC Paris as CEO (or equivalent). With regards to the number of <a>CEO</a>s of <a>Fortune Global 500</a> companies, HEC would be ranked the 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; higher education institution in the world, and the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; in Europe.</p>
<p>The <a>Grande &#x00e9;cole</a> programme (<a>MSc in Management</a>) is known for its very competitive entrance exam (<em>concours</em>). Fewer than 4% of French students attending the dedicated and selective undergraduate curriculum (see <a>preparatory classes</a>) are admitted each year. Because of this selection, HEC is regarded as one of the most prestigious schools in France together with the <a>&#x00c9;cole Polytechnique</a> (engineering) and the <a>&#x00c9;cole Normale Sup&#x00e9;rieure</a> (sciences and literature) which have similar recruitment processes.</p>
<p>HEC also offers well-ranked MBA, Executive MBA, MSc and specialized master programmes, as well as Ph.D. degrees.</p>
<p>Together with leading parisian schools of engineering such as the <a>Ecole Polytechnique</a>, HEC is a constituent of the <a>Paris Institute of Technology</a> (ParisTech), an association of top Grandes Ecoles willing to create a collegiate university by the year 2020.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<h3>History</h3>
<p>In 1819, the <a>&#x00c9;cole sup&#x00e9;rieure de commerce de Paris</a> became the first business school created in the world. Yet, many of the most prestigious French <a>grandes &#x00e9;coles</a> already existed. For example, the <a>&#x00c9;cole Polytechnique</a> and the <a>&#x00c9;cole Normale Sup&#x00e9;rieure</a> were created during the <a>French Revolution</a>.</p>
<p>Most business schools were created decades later, at the end of the 19th century, and were less attractive than universities. Established in 1881 by the <a>Paris Chamber of Commerce</a> (CCIP), the &#x00c9;cole des Hautes &#x00c9;tudes Commerciales (HEC) wanted to be in the fields of <a>management</a> and <a>trade</a> what <a>Centrale Paris</a> was in the field of <a>engineering</a>. In order to gain recognition from the academic world, the school offered lessons similar to what was taught in secondary education and few classes in management.</p>
<p>Despite its ambition and the quality of its teachers (often chosen among prestigious Parisian <a>academics</a>), the school was considered as a second chance for <a>upper-class</a> children who did not want to attend university and a way to shorten compulsory <a>military service</a> (one year instead of three). As a result, HEC suffered from a lack of attractiveness at least until the 1930s. Created in 1892, the entrance examination was removed between 1906 and 1913.</p>
<p>In 1921, the school introduced the <a>case-based method</a> of the <a>Harvard Business School</a>, but most of lectures remained theoretical. In 1938, HEC program was lengthened to 3 years.</p>
<p>The problem of attractiveness disappeared after <a>world war two</a>, due to French corporation demand for North American style management education. At the end of the 1950s the case-based method is generalized and a one-year <a>classe preparatoire</a> is created to prepare the entrance examination which had become difficult. An evidence of the recognition of the diploma is that only 9% of HEC students also attended university in 1959, whereas 47% had done so in 1929.</p>
<p>In 1964, French President <a>Charles de Gaulle</a> inaugurated a new  wooded campus in <a>Jouy-en-Josas</a>. In 1967, HEC launched its executive education programs. At that time, the CCIP wanted HEC to become an <a>MBA</a> school like Harvard. Since the alumni opposed this project, the CCIP established a new school in 1969, the Institut Sup&#x00e9;rieur des Affaires (ISA). Yet HEC and ISA joined forces in the &quot;Centre d'enseignement sup&#x00e9;rieur des affaires&quot; the following year. This group changed its named to &quot;Groupe HEC&quot; in 1989.</p>
<p>Women have been accepted at HEC only since 1973. Only 27 girls were accepted that year and &quot;<a>HEC jeunes filles</a>&quot; (<a>HECJF</a>), another school dedicated to women, disappeared. Its alumni are officially considered as graduated from HEC. HECJF alumni include, for example, <a>&#x00c9;dith Cresson</a>, the first and to date the only woman to have held the office of <a>Prime Minister of France</a>.</p>
<p>During the 1970s, HEC began to become global. It signed a partnership with the <a>New York University</a> and the <a>London School of Economics</a> in 1973, and has recruited foreign students since 1975. In 1988, HEC founded the <a>CEMS</a> network with <a>ESADE</a>, the <a>Bocconi University</a> and the <a>Cologne University</a>.</p>
<h3>Rankings</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Business School</strong>: the business school as a whole has been ranked 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; in Europe by the Financial Times before the <a>London Business School</a> since 2006. <a>Mines ParisTech</a>, which publishes an annual study on the educational background of CEOs of Fortune Global 500 companies, ranks HEC Paris 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; in the world, and 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; in Europe before <a>Oxford University</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Grande Ecole &#x2013; MSc in Management</strong>: 
    <ul>
      <li>French magazines and newspapers rank HEC 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; in France most of the times, but sometimes second to <a>ESSEC</a> or <a>ESCP Europe</a>. The choices made by French students clearly rank HEC 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;: in 2010, ESSEC lost 285 of its admitted students to HEC, ESCP Europe lost 331 of them to HEC, while only 1 student admitted at HEC chose another business school.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li>*The <em><a>Financial Times</a></em> publishes a ranking of Masters in Management, and constantly ranks the Grande Ecole degree among the top 3 programmes worldwide. The school was ranked 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; three times in the last five years. The <a>CEMS MiM</a>, a European programme offered to the students of the Grande Ecole is also ranked in the top 3.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>MBA</strong>: the Master in Business Administration is generally ranked among the top 20 programmes worldwide, the last rankings of the <em><a>Wall Street Journal</a></em> and <em><a>The Economist</a></em> even ranked it among the top 10 MBA worldwide.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Executive MBA</strong>: HEC offers a joint EMBA with the <a>London School of Economics</a> and the <a>NYU Stern School of Business</a> which is constantly ranked among the top 3 programmes worldwide by the <em>Financial Times</em>.</li>

</ul>
<p></p>
<h2><em>Grande Ecole</em> (MSc in Management)</h2>
<p>The <a>Master of Science in Management</a>  is HEC's leading program.; it was ranked number one in the world by the <em>Financial Times</em>  from 2005 to 2008. In 2010, HEC was ranked second to <a>ESCP Europe</a>, the other top ranked business school of the <a>Paris Chamber of Commerce</a>. Yet, during the last five years, 1,633 students from preparatory classes were admitted to both HEC and ESCP and only 2 chose ESCP.</p>
<h4>Admissions</h4>
<p>French students, unless they have studied abroad, must succeed at a competitive entrance examination, known as the <em>concours</em>. There are two <em>concours</em>, depending on undergraduate studies:</p>
<ul>
  <li>380 places are offered to students enrolled in <em><a>Classes pr&#x00e9;paratoires aux grandes &#x00e9;coles</a></em></li>
  <li>40 places are offered to students holding a Bachelor's degree of a French institution</li>
</ul>
<p>Holders of a non-French Bachelor's degree are required to submit a <a>GMAT</a> and a transcript of their grades before being interviewed.</p>
<h5><em>Classes pr&#x00e9;paratoires</em></h5>
<p>[[File:LYCEEH4.JPG|thumb|right|[[Lyc&#x00e9;e Henri IV]] in Paris was the first provider of new students in 2009]] The <em>classes pr&#x00e9;paratoires aux grandes &#x00e9;coles</em> are a two-year curriculum extensible to three-years, acting as a prep course with the main goal of training undergraduate students for enrolment in one of the <em><a>grandes &#x00e9;coles</a></em>. They are considered as a <em>royal way</em> in the French higher education system, except for Law and Medical studies.</p>
<p>In a given year, 800,000 people are born in France, 480,000 pass the <a>baccalaureat</a> (high school diploma), and 37,000 of them are admitted in preparatory classes according to their grades in high school. More than 9,000 students enroll in prep courses for entrance exams into business schools. This curriculum is widely known in France as &quot;<em>pr&#x00e9;pa HEC</em>&quot;. For a minimum of two years, <em>pr&#x00e9;parationnaires</em> study an average of 58 hours per week.  Their intensive coursework includes Mathematics, either Economic History or Economics, Philosophy and Literature (<em>culture g&#x00e9;n&#x00e9;rale</em>), English and another foreign language. They have written and oral examinations every week. </p>
<p>The <em>concours</em> includes at least an examination in each subject studied and both written and oral examinations. Depending on how many schools students apply to, written examinations spread over two of three weeks. HEC requires 26 hours of written exams, all of them being shared with other schools such as <a>ESSEC</a> and <a>ESCP Europe</a>. Oral examinations take place on the campus for three or four days. They are public and attended by hundreds of students expecting to apply the following year as well as other candidates and professors.</p>
<p>In 2010, 9,695 students from preparatory classes were candidates to business schools. Among them, only 4,506 were candidates to HEC, the others preferring to focus on less selective schools. Among those 4,506 candidates, only 700 were invited to oral examinations, and 382 were offered admission. There is no waiting list for very few admitted candidates decide not to enroll. In 2010, the Grande Ecole's yield, or the percent of students who matriculate after being accepted, was 98.7%. The hierarchy among Grandes Ecoles is very rigid and students enrolling at ESSEC while admitted at HEC are very rare, as well as students enrolling at ESCP while admitted at ESSEC...</p>
<h5>Holders of a Bachelor's degree</h5>
<p>French graduates with a <em>Licence</em> (<a>Bachelor's degree</a>) can also apply for admission to the Grande Ecole programme. If they pass another dedicated <em>concours</em>, they are admitted directly in the second year. In 2010, 40 candidates out of 899 were offered admission (&lt;4.5%). In practice, most of the 40 admitted candidates already hold a Master's degree. There is no waiting list.</p>
<p>The <a>International Admissions Service</a> manages the recruitment tests and interviews on behalf of HEC and three other Grandes Ecoles in France. Admission to this programme requires a degree gained upon successful completion of at least three years of university education outside France in any field.</p>
<p>French is not a requirement and the average GMAT of admitted students is 720.</p>
<p>Admitted students enroll directly in the second year of the programme.</p>
<h4>Curriculum</h4>
<p>French students who attended a <em>classe pr&#x00e9;paratoire</em> are taught fundamental managerial sciences during their first year at HEC.  Courses include <a>economics</a>, <a>accounting</a>, <a>finance</a>, <a>law</a>, <a>psychology</a>, <a>sociology</a> and <a>mathematics</a> (models, <a>operations research</a>, and <a>statistics</a>). During this first year, students can spend a semester in a foreign university (e.g. <a>Wharton</a>, <a>Bocconi University</a>, <a>Trinity College</a>, <a>University of British Columbia</a>...) . They can also enroll in a specific one-year program to get a Bachelor's degree from a French university (see below).</p>
<p>Direct admits, including international students, enter directly into the second year where they begin a business intensive program. Courses include corporate and market finance, accounting, marketing, law, mathematics, management, <a>human resources</a>, and <a>supply chain</a>. Second year students are also given the opportunity to spend one semester in a foreign university.  At the end of their second year, students choose specific majors, and must pass through a by far less competitive application process.</p>
<p>In order to graduate, students are required to have 8 months of <a>internship</a>s.  Since this is usually difficult during the summer, many students take a semester or year off for their internship, generally between the second and third year.</p>
<p>The final year of study covers intensive courses in the chosen major.</p>

<p>The <strong>Institut sup&#x00e9;rieur des affaires</strong> is the department of the school that manages its MBA program. This program attracts students from around the world with more than 55 nationalities represented in the 2008 graduating class. The selection process seeks a balance between academic achievement, professional experience, international exposure, and personal motivation. Knowledge of French is not an entry requirement, but participants are highly encouraged to have a basic knowledge of French by the start of the MBA Program.</p>
<p>The MBA Program has <a>exchange</a> and <a>double degree partnerships</a> with numerous universities and business schools around the world. It also offers a Part-Time MBA program.</p>
<p>In 2010, HEC MBA was ranked by the Financial Times  as 7th among European business schools, and 18th among worldwide business schools. The Economist , on the other hand, ranked HEC MBA as 3rd in Europe and 9th worldwide.</p>
<h2>Executive Education</h2>
<p><a>300px|thumb|The 19th &quot;ch&#x00e2;teau&quot; dedicated to Executive Education</a> HEC offers a number of Executive MBAs.</p>
<h3>Executive MBA</h3>
<p>The <a>HEC Executive MBA</a> is a program for top executives with a minimum of 8 years' corporate experience which prepares for general management positions (the average background experience of students is about 14 years).

<p>HEC also offers the <a>TRIUM Global Executive MBA programme</a> jointly with <a>Stern School of Business</a> of <a>NYU</a> and the <a>London School of Economics</a>. It is divided into six modules held in five international business locations over a 16-month period. Whitefield Consulting Worldwide, a global MBA consultancy, has ranked the TRIUM Executive MBA programme as second worldwide. The Financial Times' most recent rankings (2009) of executive MBA programmes also placed TRIUM as second worldwide</p>
<h3>Executive Masters</h3>
<p>HEC also offers two <a>executive masters</a> jointly with the <a>University of Oxford</a> (<a>Sa&#x00ef;d Business School</a>)</p>
<h2>Alumni association</h2>
