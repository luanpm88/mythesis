<p>The <strong>Bristol Old Vic Theatre School</strong>, opened by <a>Laurence Olivier</a> in 1946, is an affiliate of the <a>Conservatoire for Dance and Drama</a>, an organisation securing the highest standards of training in the performing arts, and is an associate school of the Faculty of Creative Arts of the <a>University of the West of England</a>.</p>
<h2>Courses</h2>
<p>The theatre school only accepts 12 people out of some 2500 applications a year, for the three-year BA acting course making it one of the most selective <a>drama school</a>s in the world. It previously had working links with the Drama Department of the <a>University of Bristol</a>, which still holds many papers of the Theatre School in its Theatre Collection. For many years it presented regular student productions in the Department's experimental Drama Studio converted from an indoor tennis court off a corridor in the <a>Wills Memorial Building</a> behind the University's Bell Tower at the top of Bristol's fashionable Park Street. Students from the School and the Drama Department shared many of each others' formal lectures and a number of the Department's graduates went on to continue their studies as full-time students at the School.</p>
<p>Having struggled with limited resources until the 1960s, the School now has access to a number of local performance venues, including the Redgrave Theatre at <a>Clifton College</a> (named after the actor <a>Sir Michael Redgrave</a>, an old boy of the College) and the Bristol Old Vic theatre complex, including the Theatre Royal, New Vic Studio and The Basement. It also takes productions on tour to various locations in the <a>West Country</a>, a tradition dating back to the 1950s when for several years students moved to <a>Dartington Hall</a> in South <a>Devon</a> for two weeks each spring where they rehearsed and presented a public production in the Barn Theatre. The School was able to use broadcasting studio facilities at the University Drama Studio for radio drama training in the 1950s and also ran occasional courses in conjunction with the <a>BBC</a> at their Bristol Studios in Whiteladies Road. In 2002 the Theatre School bought the former BBC Christchurch radio studios in Clifton and has further developed the facilities there which include sound studios and sound and video editing suites which are used by students and also by music and media industry clients.  The school also has a scenic workshop in Bedminster, South Bristol used by the technical courses.</p>
<p>The Bristol Old Vic Theatre School, as its name suggests, is not simply a school for actors. It provides comprehensive training courses for all theatre, radio, film, and television professionals and its graduates are to be found in key positions as actors, directors, set designers, costumer designers, lighting designers and stage and company managers throughout the world.  Among the most notable of the many distinguished actors on the School's list of alumni are the <a>Academy Award</a> winners <a>Daniel Day-Lewis</a> and <a>Jeremy Irons</a> and multiple <a>Academy Award</a> nominees <a>Miranda Richardson</a> and <a>Pete Postlethwaite</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The School began life in October 1946, only eight months after the founding of its parent <a>Bristol Old Vic Theatre Company</a>, in a room above a fruit merchant's warehouse in the Rackhay near the stage door of the Theatre Royal. (The yard of the derelict St Nicholas School adjacent to the warehouse was still used by the Company for rehearsals of crowd scenes and stage fights as late as the early 1960s, notably for John Hale's productions of <em><a>Romeo and Juliet</a></em> starring the Canadian actor <a>Paul Massie</a> and <a>Annette Crosbie</a>, a former student of the School, and <a>Rostand</a>'s <em><a>Cyrano de Bergerac</a></em> with <a>Peter Wyngarde</a>. Students from the Theatre School frequently played in these crowd scenes and fights.)</p>
<p>The School continued in these premises for eight years because of the Old Vic's lack of funds in the post-war decade until 1954 when the Company produced a small-scale end-of season topical musical for the entertainment of regular patrons and to allow the actors to let their hair down after a season of mainly serious productions.</p>
<p>This musical, <em>Salad Days</em> by <a>Julian Slade</a> and Dorothy Reynolds, proved very popular with Bristol audiences and was subsequently transferred to London's West End where it was an instant hit and played for more than four years, making it the longest running production in West End history at the time. &#x00a3;7,000 from the <em>Salad Days</em> profits &#x2014; a large sum in those days &#x2014; was given to the School towards the purchase and conversion of two large adjoining Victorian villas at 1 and 2 Downside Road in Clifton. In 1995 the enduring benefit to students of that donation was formally recognised when a new custom-built dance and movement studio in the School's back garden was named the <em>Slade/Reynolds Studio</em>.</p>
<p>Many distinguished members of the theatrical profession have taught at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School. Perhaps the best known was the legendary Rudi Shelly, who joined the teaching staff only two weeks after the School opened in 1946 and was still working into his nineties. Former students from around the world gathered in Bristol for his funeral at which the eulogy was delivered by former student <a>Stephanie Cole</a>. Apart from students of the School, over the years many established actors from around the world sought out Rudi Shelly's master classes when visiting or working in England.</p>
<p>At the time of the School's move to its current premises in Downside Road, Clifton, in 1956, the Principal was Duncan (Bill) Ross, who had succeeded the first Principal, Edward Stanley in 1954. After guiding the School through seven difficult years that are nonetheless still regarded by his former students as a golden age, Ross left in late 1961 to take up a teaching post in the USA. Soon after the departure of this much-loved principal, other key staff members resigned, including <a>Daphne Heard</a> and Maggie Collins, and Paula Gwyn-Davies, the School Secretary.</p>
<p>After a short interregnum under the actor <a>Richard Ainley</a>, the post of Principal was taken by Nat Brenner, a distinguished actor and theatre technician and, at that time, General Manager of the Bristol Old Vic Theatre. Brenner's stewardship was regarded by students of the time as another golden age. He remained in the post until 1980, when he was succeeded by Christopher Denys, who retired in the summer of 2007 to be replaced by Paul Rummer</p>
