<h2>Campus events</h2>
<p>In February 2006, Jacksonville State University was named the &quot;winner&quot; of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) <a>Speech Code of the Month.</a> At the time, FIRE called the University Code of Conduct &#x201c;illegally overbroad.&#x201d; They considered the code to be in violation of the First Amendment of the Constitution which protects offensive speech. The policy has since been changed.    </p>
<p>In August 2007, University President Dr. William Meehan was implicated in a plagiarism scandal related to his periodic column entitled &quot;Town &amp; Gown,&quot; which was actually written by the school's <a>news bureau</a>. These columns were written by the recently retired Director of JSU&#x2019;s News Bureau who was working part-time to ghostwrite the weekly &#x201c;Town &amp; Gown&#x201d; column. A committee appointed by the President found no wrong-doing on the part of Meehan other than a lack of administrative oversight, and it was decided that responsibility for the plagiarism was that of the writer.</p>
<p>In October 2007, the College of Commerce and Business Administration was named one of the 290 best business schools in the world by <a>The Princeton Review</a> and ranked second in providing the greatest opportunities for women.</p>
<p>In 2007, the school broke ground for the  Little River Canyon Center. The building will house National Park Service offices, an exhibit hall, meeting space, classrooms, and comfort stations and will be the site of the JSU Little River Canyon Field School - which sponsors dozens of activities, seminars and programs each year. In 1992, the canyon was designated a national preserve. During the summer months, the staff includes 15 park rangers.</p>
<p>In spring 2008, the website <a>GetEducated.com</a> ranked the Master of Science in Computer Systems and Software Design as second on its list of &quot;best buys&quot; among 67 online master's programs in computer science and information technology offered by regionally accredited institutions in the United States.</p>
<p>In April 2009, allegations surfaced that University President Dr. William Meehan plagiarized his doctoral dissertation at the University of Alabama in 1999. A <a>plagiarism expert</a>, hired by a plaintiff in a lawsuit against the university, concluded that &#x201c;extensive portions&#x201d; of Dr. Meehan&#x2019;s dissertation plagiarized the work of Dr. Carl Boening. Spokespersons for the University of Alabama and Jacksonville State University stated that the matter would not be investigated. The University of Alabama conducted a review of the matter in 2007, but has not yet disclosed the findings of that inquiry, or the qualifications of its investigators. The University of Alabama has not declared that Dr. Meehan did not use plagiarized material.</p>
<p>In September 2010, the school's marching band, The Marching Southerners, was awarded the nationally recognized George Washington Honor Medal for their patriotic 2009 shows.</p>
<p>In 2012, The Southerners will play in the New Year's Day Parade in London, England which will also kick off the 2012 summer Olympics celebrations.</p>

<h2>International House Program</h2>
<p>The International House program is a unique part of JSU campus life. The program began in <a>1946</a> with five students from <a>France</a>. Initially, the program focused on languages.  Today, there are forty members of the program, twenty <a>American</a> students and twenty <a>internationals</a>.</p>
<p>Each international student is from a different <a>country</a> and is roomed with an American student. Though emphasis is still placed on languages, greater emphasis is now placed on the overall aspects of cultural understanding.  Truly, the International House Program provides &quot;A Window on the World&quot; for students at Jacksonville State University and the surrounding community. The International House is a stepping stone in Jacksonville which allows the growing international community to be increasingly active in student affairs. The <em>International Student Organization</em> (ISO) is one of many organizations at JSU committed to international and American students alike.</p>
<h2>University slogans</h2>
<ul>
  <li>&quot;The Friendliest Campus in the South&quot;- According to NSSE (National Survey of Student Engagement), Jacksonville State University really does live up to this nickname, which is one that has survived the test of time. JSU's high scores in the survey's Supportive Campus Environment category support this claim.</li>
