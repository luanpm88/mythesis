<p>The <strong>Royal Academy of Music</strong> in <a>London</a>, <a>England</a>, is a <a>conservatoire</a>, Britain's oldest degree-granting music school and a constituent college of the <a>University of London</a> since 1999. The Academy was founded by <a>Lord Burghersh</a> in 1822 with the help and ideas of the French  harpist and composer <a>Nicolas Bochsa</a> and in 1830 was granted a <a>Royal Charter</a> by <a>King</a> <a>George IV</a>. It is a <a>registered charity</a> under English law.  </p>
<h2>The Academy</h2>
<h3>Studies</h3>
<p>The Royal Academy of Music offers training from infant level (Junior Academy), with the senior Academy awarding the <a>LRAM</a> diploma, BMus and higher degrees to <a>Ph.D.</a> The former Graduate Diploma <a>GRSM</a>, equivalent to a university honours degree and taken by some students, was phased out in the 1990s.  All undergraduates now take the University of London degree of BMus.</p>
<p>Most Academy students are classical performers: strings, piano, vocal studies including opera, brass, woodwind, conducting and choral conducting, composition, percussion, harp, organ, accordion, guitar. There are also departments for musical theatre performance and jazz. </p>
<p>The Academy collaborates with other conservatoires worldwide, including participating in the <a>SOCRATES</a> student and staff exchange programme. In 1991, the Academy introduced a fully accredited degree in Performance Studies, and in September 1999, it became a full constituent college of the University of London, in both cases becoming the first UK conservatoire to do so.</p>
<p>The Academy has students from over 50 countries, following diverse programmes including instrumental performance, conducting,  composition, jazz, musical theatre and opera. The Academy has an established relationship with <a>King's College London</a>, particularly the Department of Music, whose students receive instrumental tuition at the Academy. In return, many students at the Academy take a range of <a>Humanities</a> choices at King's, and its extended academic <a>musicological</a> curriculum.</p>
<p>The Junior Academy, for pupils under the age of 18, takes place every Saturday.</p>
<h3>The building</h3>
<p>The Academy&#x2019;s current facilities are situated on <a>Marylebone Road</a> in <a>central London</a> adjacent to <a>Regent's Park</a>.  The Academy&#x2019;s first building was in <a>Tenterden Street, Hanover Square</a>  and in 1911 the institution moved to the current premises (which include the 450-seat Duke's Hall) In the 1976 the Academy acquired the houses situated on the north side and built between them a new opera theatre donated by philanthropist  <a>Sir Jack Lyons</a> and named after him and two new recital spaces, a recording studio, an electronic music studio, several practice rooms and office space.  </p>
<p>The Academy expanded again its facilities in the late 1990s, with the addition of 1-5 York Gate, designed by <a>John Nash</a> in 1822, to house the new <a>museum</a>, a musical theatre studio and several teaching and practice rooms.  To link the main building and  1-5 York Gate a new underground passage and the underground barrel-vaulted 150-seat David Josefowitz recital hall were built on the courtyard between the mentioned structures.</p>
<h3>Library and archives</h3>
<p>The Academy's library contains over 160,000 items, including significant collections of early printed and manuscript materials and audio facilities. The library also houses archives dedicated to Sir <a>Arthur Sullivan</a> and Sir <a>Henry Wood</a>. Among the Library's most valuable possessions are the manuscripts of <a>Purcell's</a> <em><a>The Fairy Queen</a></em>, Sullivan's <em><a>The Mikado</a></em>, <a>Vaughan Williams</a>' <em><a>Fantasia on a Theme of Thomas Tallis</a></em> and <em><a>Serenade to Music</a></em>, and the newly-discovered <a>Handel</a> <em><a>Gloria</a></em>. A grant from the <a>National Heritage Memorial Fund</a> has assisted in the purchase of the Robert Spencer Collection &#x2014; a set of Early English Song and Lute music, as well as a fine collection of <a>lute</a>s and <a>guitar</a>s. The Academy's museum displays many of these items. The Orchestral Library has approximately 4,500 sets of orchestral parts. Other collections include the libraries of Sir Henry Wood and <a>Otto Klemperer</a>. </p>
<p><a>Harriet Cohen</a> bequeathed a large collection of paintings, some photographs and her gold bracelet to the Academy, with a request that the room in which the paintings were to be housed was named the &quot;<a>Arnold Bax</a> Room&quot;. Noted for her performances of Bach and modern English music, she was a friend and advocate of Arnold Bax and also premi&#x00e8;red <a>Vaughan Williams</a>' Piano Concerto - a work dedicated to her - in 1933. In 1886, Franz Liszt, performed at the Academy to celebrate the creation of the <em>Franz Liszt Scholarship</em>  and in 1843 Mendelssohn was made an honorary member of the Academy. </p>
<p>The Academy regularly celebrates the work of a living composer with a <a>festival</a> in the presence of the composer. Previous composer festivals at the Academy have been devoted to the work of <a>Witold Lutos&#x0142;awski</a>, <a>Michael Tippett</a>, <a>Krzysztof Penderecki</a>, <a>Olivier Messiaen</a>, <a>Hans Werner Henze</a>, <a>Luciano Berio</a>, <a>Elliott Carter</a>, as well as Academy graduates, <a>Alfred Schnittke</a>, <a>Gy&#x00f6;rgy Ligeti</a>, British and American film composers, <a>Franco Donatoni</a>, <a>Galina Ustvolskaya</a>, <a>Arvo P&#x00e4;rt</a>, <a>Gy&#x00f6;rgy Kurt&#x00e1;g</a> and <a>Mauricio Kagel</a>.</p>
<p>In February-March 2006, an Academy festival celebrated the violin virtuoso <a>Niccol&#x00f2; Paganini</a>, who first visited <a>London</a> 175 years earlier in 1831. The festival included a <a>recital</a> by Academy professor <a>Maxim Vengerov</a>, who performed on <em><a>Il Cannone Guarnerius</a></em>, Paganini's favorite violin. Academy instrumentalists and musical theatre students have also performed in a series of concerts with Academy alumnus Sir <a>Elton John</a>.</p>
