<h2>History</h2>
<p></p>
<h3>Predecessor institutions and University Charter</h3>
<p>Boston University traces its roots to the establishment of the Newbury Biblical Institute in <a>Newbury, Vermont</a> in 1839, and was chartered with the name &quot;Boston University&quot; by the Massachusetts Legislature in 1869. The University organized formal Centennial observances both in 1939 and 1969.</p>
<p>On 24&#x2013;25 April 1839 a group of <a>Methodist</a> ministers and laymen at the Old Bromfield Street Church in Boston elected to establish a Methodist theological school.  Set up in Newbury, Vermont, the school was named the Newbury Biblical Institute.</p>
<p>In 1847, the <a>Congregational</a> Society in <a>Concord, New Hampshire</a>, invited the Institute to relocate to Concord and made available a disused Congregational church building with a capacity of 1200 people. Other citizens of Concord covered the remodeling costs. One stipulation of the invitation was that the Institute remain in Concord for at least 20 years. The charter issued by <a>New Hampshire</a> designated the school the &quot;Methodist General Biblical Institute&quot;, but it was commonly called the &quot;Concord Biblical Institute.&quot;</p>
<p>With the agreed twenty years coming to a close, the Trustees of the Concord Biblical Institute purchased  on Aspinwall Hill in Brookline, Massachusetts as a possible relocation site. The Institute moved in 1867 to 23 Pinkney Street in Boston and received a Massachusetts Charter as the &quot;Boston Theological Institute.&quot;</p>
<p>In 1869, three Trustees of the Boston Theological Institute obtained from the Massachusetts Legislature a charter for a university by name of &quot;Boston University.&quot; These three were successful Boston businessmen and Methodist laymen, with a history of involvement in educational enterprises and became the Founders of Boston University. They were <a>Isaac Rich</a> (1801&#x2013;1872), <a>Lee Claflin</a> (1791&#x2013;1871), and <a>Jacob Sleeper</a> (1802&#x2013;1889), for whom Boston University's three <a>West Campus</a> dormitories are named. Lee Claflin's son, <a>William</a>, was then Governor of Massachusetts and signed the University Charter on 26 May 1869 after it was passed by the Legislature.</p>
<p>As reported by Kathleen Kilgore in her book, &quot;Transformations, A History of Boston University&quot; (see <a>Further Reading</a>), the Founders directed the inclusion in the Charter of the following provision, unusual for its time:</p>
<p>:No instructor in said University shall ever be required by the Trustees to profess any particular religious opinions as a test of office, and no student shall be refused admission . . . on account of the religious opinions he may entertain; provided, nonetheless, that this section shall not apply to the theological department of said University.</p>
<p>Every department of the new University was also open to all on an equal footing regardless of sex, race, or (with the exception of the School of Theology) religion.</p>
<h3>Early years (1870&#x2013;1900)</h3>
<p>The Boston Theological Institute was absorbed into Boston University in 1871 as the <a>BU School of Theology</a>.</p>
<p>In January 1872 Isaac Rich died, leaving the vast bulk of his estate to a trust that would go to Boston University after ten years of growth while the University was organized. Most of this bequest consisted of real estate throughout the core of the city of Boston and was appraised at more than $1.5 million. Kilgore describes this as the largest single donation to an American college or university to that time.</p>
<p>By December, the <a>Great Boston Fire of 1872</a> had destroyed all but one of the buildings Rich had left to the University, and the insurance companies with which they had been insured were bankrupt. The value of his estate, when turned over to the University in 1882, was half what it had been in 1872. As a result, the University was unable to build its contemplated campus on Aspinwall Hill and the land was sold piecemeal as development sites. Street names in the area, including Claflin Road, Claflin Path, and University Road, are the only remaining evidence of University ownership in this area.</p>
<p>Boston University established its facilities in buildings scattered through the less fashionable parts of Beacon Hill, and later expanded into the Boylston Street and <a>Copley Square</a> area before building the Charles River Campus after 1937.</p>
<h3>20th century and establishment of the Charles River campus</h3>
<p><a>right|300px|thumb|Marsh Plaza and its surrounding buildings were one of the first completed parts of the Charles River Campus.</a> Seeking to unify a geographically scattered school and enable it to participate in the development of the city, school president Lemuel Murlin arranged that the school buy the present campus along the <a>Charles River</a>.  Between 1920 and 1928, the school bought the  of land that had been reclaimed from the river by the Riverfront Improvement Association.  Plans for a riverside quadrangle with a multistory administrative tower modeled on the &quot;Old Boston Stump&quot; in <a>Boston</a>, England were scaled back in the late 1920s when the State Metropolitan District Commission used <a>eminent domain</a> to seize riverfront land for <a>Storrow Drive</a>.  Through a series of fundraising campaigns by Murlin, the school slowly filled in its new campus.</p>
<p>In 1951, Harold Case became the school's fifth president and under his direction the character of the campus changed dramatically, as he sought to transform the school into a national research university. The campus tripled in size to , and added 68 new buildings before Case retired in 1967. The first large dorms, Claflin, Rich and Sleeper Halls in <a>West Campus</a> were built, and in 1965 construction began on 700 Commonwealth Avenue, later named <a>Warren Towers</a>, designed to house 1800 students. Between 1961 and 1966, the <a>BU Law Tower</a>, the <a>George Sherman Union</a>, and the <a>Mugar Memorial Library</a> were constructed in the <a>Brutalist</a> style, a departure from the school's traditional architecture. The College of Engineering and <a>College of Communication</a> were housed in a former stable building and auto-show room, respectively.</p>
<p>The Presidency of John Silber also saw much expansion.  In the late 1970s, the <a>Lahey Clinic</a> vacated its building at 605 Commonwealth Avenue and moved to <a>Burlington, Massachusetts</a>.  The vacated building was purchased by BU to house the <a>School of Education</a>.  Then in the late 90s, concerns over lack of a &quot;campusy&quot; feel and the physical divide between the east and the western portion of campus triggered another wave of development.  The <a>John Hancock Student Village</a> or StuVi was constructed with the intent of unifying the two campuses. This facility includes a new <a>Fitness and Recreation Center</a> (FitRec), a <a>large multipurpose arena</a>, and three new dormitories, one of which opened in 2000, the other two were finished by fall of 2009, including a 26-story new tallest on-campus building (left). The 19 and 26-story towers, known as StuV-II, house another 960 students, and have made possible the guarantee of on-campus housing to the 80% of its 16,000 undergrads who opt for it, without shunting overflow into nearby hotels as was the practice in past years.</p>
<p>In addition to the John Hancock Student Village, other projects were also completed under Silber.  These projects range from the construction of the Photonics Center for the study of light, to the construction of the Life Science and Engineering Building for interdisciplinary research, to the renovation of 928 Commonwealth Ave in order to create a permanent home for the School of Hospitality Administration (SHA), were complete under Silber.</p>
<h3>The 21st century</h3>
<p>Dr. Robert Brown's presidency, which started in 2005, will seek to further the consolidation of campus infrastructure that was commenced by Case and continued by Silber.  In particular, Brown has committed Boston University to investing $1.8 billion in the fulfillment of its 10-year strategic plan, devoting new resources to unlocking cross-college opportunities for undergraduates, improving the campus&#x2019;s academic and residential facilities, and recruiting new faculty for the University&#x2019;s largest college.  The strategy, titled &quot;Choosing to Be Great,&quot; sets goals to be carried out over the next decade, and calls for increasing annual expenditures of up to $225 million for support of the plan&#x2019;s major goals.</p>
<p>The cornerstone of the plan, which calls for more campuswide collaboration, is a focus on undergraduate education, starting with an effort to encourage cross-registration among schools and colleges and encourage undergraduate students to take full advantage of both the liberal arts and the professional programs available. In an attempt to strengthen the liberal arts, the College of Arts and Sciences and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences are slated to hire 100 new tenure-track faculty members over the next decade.  In addition, interdisciplinary research that spans traditional branches of study has also been identified as a current strength with room for growth.  Andrei Ruckenstein, a CAS professor of physics and the newly appointed associate provost and vice president of research, is working with the faculty to identify BU&#x2019;s current strengths in cross-disciplinary research and to drive the hiring of up to 30 new faculty members to help grow these activities across the University.</p>
<p>Several of the University&#x2019;s professional schools have also been targeted as current strengths and candidates for growth. The School of Management will hire 20 new faculty.  The School of Law will begin its capital campaign for an expanded and fully renovated facility, with a dollar-for-dollar match in funding from the University. The College of Fine Arts, long recognized for integrating its undergraduate and graduate programs with respected arts institutions throughout greater Boston, also has plans for facilities renovation and expansion, with the same financial commitment from the University.</p>
<p>The School of Medicine also is poised for growth. Already with a national reputation in medical education, clinical practice, and research, the school is moving to expand its research efforts, especially in select areas of emphasis. The School of Medicine will also devote substantial resources towards facilities renovation and the development of more affordable student housing.</p>
<p>Initiatives focusing on life outside the classroom are considered key to the plan&#x2019;s success, and efforts to engage both current students and alumni have already begun. The ongoing construction of the Student Village 2 residence hall is part of a long-range expansion campaign that includes renovations to housing, recreational facilities, and dining halls and a focus on leveraging this commitment to strengthen the campus community.  In order to accommodate this physical expansion, Boston University has declared intentions to procure <a>air rights</a> over the <a>Mass Pike</a>. In addition to freeing up land, it's hoped the move will unify the Charles River area with South Campus, as well as bring width to a long narrow campus.</p>
<p>Initiatives intended to carry out the plan have already begun.  In the Fall of 2009, in the midst of the financial crisis, $2.5 million revamp of BU's computer services took place.  The initiative involved a complete renovation of Mugar Library&#x2019;s first floor, the purchase of 200 energy-efficient ThinClient workstations, and the relocation of the computer lab and IT Help Center from 111 Cummington St.  Several thousand books were moved to make way for the computer clusters, a shift that reflects changes in the way students and faculty use and exchange information, says Hudson. This new hub of study and interaction on campus, aptly named BU Common @ Mugar, includes an IT Help Center that occupies the wall that formerly displayed books by BU authors, as well as a reference desk, where students can seek professional help.  In addition, 888 Commonwealth Ave. has become Boston University&#x2019;s first geothermal building.  It currently houses the Kidney Center, the University&#x2019;s Center for English Language and Orientation Programs classrooms, the International Programs offices, and several retail shops and restaurants.  Last but not least, the University is planning to build a six-story,  structure housing state-of-the-art dining services and a new home for an expanded Career Services Center and the Educational Resource Center (ERC), as well as the Writing Program, Freshman Advising, and Professional Advising offices from the College of Arts &amp; Sciences.  Construction of the estimated $50 million East Campus Center for Student Services is slated to begin Fall 2010, with an opening date set for fall 2012.</p>

<h3>Boston campuses and facilities</h3>
<p>[[Image:bu beach.jpg|right|thumb|The &quot;BU Beach&quot;, located behind Marsh Plaza and the College of Arts and Sciences building, is a popular warm weather gathering place between the Charles River Campus and [[Storrow Drive]].]]</p>
<p>The University's main Charles River Campus follows <a>Commonwealth Avenue</a> and the <a>Green Line</a>, beginning near <a>Kenmore Square</a> and continuing for over a mile and a half to its end near the border of Boston's <a>Allston</a> neighborhood. The <a>Boston University Bridge</a> over the <a>Charles River</a> into <a>Cambridge</a> represents the dividing line between <strong>Main Campus</strong>, where most schools and classroom buildings are concentrated, and <strong><a>West Campus</a></strong>, home to several athletic facilities and playing fields, the large West Campus dorm, and the new John Hancock Student Village complex.</p>
<p>[[Image:BU Law Tower.JPG|thumb|left|The School of Law Tower, made in [[Brutalism|Brutalist]] styling, is the tallest academic building on campus.|180px]]As a result of its continual expansion, the Charles River campus contains an array of architecturally diverse buildings. The College of Arts and Sciences, Marsh Chapel (site of the <a>Marsh Chapel Experiment</a>), and the School of Theology buildings are the university's most recognizable and were built in the late-1930s and 1940s in collegiate gothic style. A sizable amount of the campus is traditional Boston brownstone, especially at <a>Bay State Road</a> and South Campus where BU has acquired almost every townhouse those areas offer. The buildings are primarily dormitories but many also serve as various institutes as well as department offices. From the 1960s-1980s many contemporary buildings were constructed including the Mugar Library, BU Law School and Warren Towers, all of which were built in the <a>brutalist</a> style of architecture. The <a>Metcalf Science Center for Science and Engineering</a>, constructed in 1983, might more accurately be described as <a>Structural Expressionism</a>. <a>Morse Auditorium</a>, adjacent, stands in stark architectrual contrast, as it was constructed as a <a>Jewish</a> temple. The most recent additions to BU's campus are the <a>Photonics Center</a>, Life Science and Engineering Building, The Student Village (which includes the <a>FitRec Center</a> and <a>Agganis Arena</a>), and the <a>School of Management</a>. All these buildings were built in brick, a few with a substantial amount of brownstone.</p>
<h4>Student housing</h4>
<p>[[Image:WarrenTowersOverCharles.jpg|thumb|250px|Rising over the [[Charles River]], <a>Warren Towers</a> constitutes the second-largest non-military dorm in the country.]]</p>
<p></p>
<p>Boston University's housing system is the nation's 10th largest among four year colleges. BU was originally a commuter school, but the university now guarantees the option of on-campus housing for four years for all undergraduate students. Currently, 76% of the undergraduate population lives on campus. Boston University requires that all students living in dormitories be enrolled in a year-long meal plan with several combinations of meals and dining points which can be used as cash in on-campus facilities.</p>
<p>Housing at BU is an unusually diverse melange, ranging from individual 19th-century <a>brownstone</a> <a>town house</a>s and apartment buildings acquired by the school to large-scale high-rises built in the 60s and 2000s. Because the university has so many students and is quickly running out of space to house them, the Hyatt Regency Cambridge across the river serves as a temporary dorm for some students during the fall semester.</p>
<p>The large dormitories include the 1800-student <a>Warren Towers</a>, the largest on campus, as well as West Campus and <a>The Towers</a>.  The smaller dormitory and apartment style housing are mainly located in two parts of campus: Bay State Road and the South Campus residential area. Bay State Road is a tree-lined street that runs parallel to Commonwealth Avenue and is home to the majority of BUs town houses, often called &quot;brownstones&quot;. South Campus is a student residential area south of Commonwealth Avenue and separated from the main campus by the <a>Massachusetts Turnpike</a>. Some of the larger buildings in that area have been converted into dormitories, while the rest of the South Campus buildings are apartments.</p>
<p>[[Image:Myles Standish Hall.jpg|thumb|left|Built in 1925 as [[Myles Standish]] Hotel, BU acquired and converted the building to dorm space in 1949.]]Boston University's newest residence and principal apartment-style housing area is officially called 10 Buick Street, a part of The John Hancock Student Village project. The apartments at 10 Buick Street are open to juniors and seniors only, and house more than 800 students in suite-style apartments.</p>
<p>Aside from these main residential areas, smaller residential dormitories are scattered along Commonwealth Avenue.</p>
<p>Boston University also provides <a>specialty houses</a> or specialty floors to students who have particular interests.</p>
<p>All large dormitories have 24/7 security and require all students to swipe and show their school identification before entering.</p>
<p>At least one dorm, <a>Shelton Hall</a>, is rumored to be haunted by the ghost of playwright <a>Eugene O'Neill</a>. O'Neill lived in what was originally room 401 (now 419) while the building was a residential hotel. He died in a hospital on November 27, 1953, and his ghost is rumored to haunt both the room and the floor. The fourth floor is now a specialty floor called the Writers' Corridor.</p>
<h4>John Hancock Student Village</h4>
<p>[[Image:BUNickerson+SV.jpg|thumb|left|The rear of the John Hancock Student Village, with [[Nickerson Field]] in the foreground and Boston in the background.]]  The Student Village is a large new residential and recreational complex covering  between Buick Street and <a>Nickerson Field</a>, ground formerly occupied by a <a>National Guard</a> <a>Armory</a>, which had been used by the University for indoor track and field and as a storage facility before its <a>demolition</a> and the start of construction. The Student Village was designed with the intention of fostering <a>community</a> and bridging the divide between the eastern and western portions of campus. The dormitory of apartment suites at 10 Buick Street (often abbreviated to &quot;StuVi&quot; by students) opened to juniors and seniors in the fall of 2000. In 2002, <a>John Hancock Insurance</a> announced its sponsorship of the multi-million dollar project.</p>
<p>The <a>Agganis Arena</a>, named after <a>Harry Agganis</a>, was opened to concerts and <a>hockey</a> games in January 2005. The Agganis Arena is capable of housing 6,224 spectators for <a>Terrier hockey</a> games, replacing the smaller <a>Walter Brown Arena</a>. It can also be used for concerts and shows. In March 2005, the final element of phase II of the Student Village complex, the <a>Fitness and Recreation (FitRec) Center</a>, was opened, drawing large crowds from the student body.  Construction on the rest of phase II, which included 19- and 26-story residential towers was finished in fall 2009.</p>
<h4>Other facilities</h4>
<p>[[Image:Mugar Memorial Library Exterior.jpg|220px|thumb|[[Mugar Memorial Library]] is BU's primary library|right]] The <a>Mugar Memorial Library</a> is the central academic library for the Charles River Campus.  It also houses the Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center, formerly called the Twentieth Century Archive, where documents belonging to thousands of eminent figures in <a>literature</a>, <a>journalism</a>, <a>diplomacy</a>, the arts, and other fields are housed. Among them are <a>Isaac Asimov</a>'s personal papers from 1965 onward, documents from distinguished alumnus <a>Martin Luther King Jr</a>, and the recent addition of Mary Louise Parker's personal papers.</p>
<p>The <a>George Sherman Union</a> (GSU) located next to Mugar Memorial Library provides students with an expansive food court featuring many popular fast-food chains, including <a>Panda Express</a> (which opened Fall 2006), <a>Starbucks</a> and <a>Jamba Juice</a>. The GSU also provides comfortable lounge areas in which to study. The basement of the George Sherman Union is home to the BU Central lounge, which hosts concerts and other activities and events. There is also a <a>United States Post Office</a> in the basement of the GSU.</p>
<p><a>left|thumb|200px|&quot;The Castle&quot; located on Bay State Road.</a> <a>&quot;The Castle&quot;</a> located on the West end of Bay State Road is one of the older buildings on campus, and one with an interesting, if not exactly accurate, history. According to lore, the castle was built by millionaire William Lindsay for his daughter Leslie Lindsey Mason as her wedding gift. However, she was killed when her ship, the <em><a>RMS Lusitania</a></em>, was torpedoed and sunk by German submarines on May 7, 1915. In fact the building was commissioned by William Lindsay for his own use in 1905, long before his daughter's honeymoon on the Lusitania. In 1939, the University acquired the property by agreement with the city to repay all back taxes owed; these funds were raised through donations from, among others, Dr. William Chenery, a University Trustee. It served as the residence of the University president until 1967, when President Christ-Janer found it too large for his needs as a residence and turned it to other uses.  It is now a conference space. Underneath the Castle is the <a>BU Pub</a>, the only BU-operated drinking establishment on campus.</p>
<p>Parts of the 2008 film <a>21</a> were filmed at The Castle after undisclosed legal reasons prevented <a>Robert Luketic</a> from filming at <a>MIT</a>. Other areas around the Boston University campus, including BU's School of Management, Mugar Library and FitRec, also provided production locations for the film.</p>
<p><a>Boston University School of Education</a> located at 605 Commonwealth Avenue is housed in the original location of the <a>Lahey Clinic</a>. It was the merger of two pre-existing buildings, which explains its half floors (3&#x00bd;, 4&#x00bd;, 5&#x00bd;, etc.).</p>
<p>The recently opened Florence and Chafetz Hillel House on Bay State Road is the Hillel facility for the university. With four floors and a basement, the facility includes lounges, study rooms and a kosher dining hall, open during the academic year (including Passover) to students and walk-ins from the community. The first floor also includes the Granby St.Cafe as well as TV's and ping-pong, pool and foosball tables. The Hillel serves as a focal point for BU's large and active Jewish community. It hosts approximately 30 student groups, including social, cultural and religious groups and BU Students for Israel (BUSI), Holocaust Education and the Center for Jewish Learning and Experience. It hosts a plethora of programs and speakers as well as Friday and Saturday shabbat services and meals.</p>
<p>Weld House, the office of the president of Boston University, is the former home of <a>Charles Goddard Weld</a>, a member of the wealthy <a>Weld family</a> of Massachusetts.  The adjoining Dunn House contains the Office of the Chancellor.</p>
<p><a>Barnes and Noble</a> at Boston University is the university's bookstore, which is located on Kenmore Square. Consisting of five floors the bookstore holds all BU students' needs ranging from books to clothes to coffee. Materials for others schools such as the Boston Architecture Center are also sold through the store.</p>
<h4>Cultural life</h4>
<p>Located at the junction of <a>Fenway-Kenmore</a>, <a>Allston</a>, and <a>Brookline</a>, the university has long enjoyed these neighborhood's cultural offerings. In the Fenway-Kenmore area are the <a>Museum of Fine Arts</a>, the <a>Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum</a>, and Landsdowne Street. Allston has been Boston's largest bohemian neighborhood since the 1960s. Nicknamed &quot;Allston Rock City,&quot; the neighborhood is home to many artists and musicians, as well as a variety of caf&#x00e9;s, and many of Boston's small music halls. Beyond the southern border of the campus in Brookline, Harvard Avenue offers independent and foreign films at Coolidge Corner Theatre, and readings by esteemed authors at the Brookline Booksmith. Other local destinations for campus intellectuals and culture lovers include Symphony Hall, the Beacon Book Annex, Jordan Hall, the main branch of the Boston Public Library in Copley Square, the art and commerce of Newbury Street, and, across the river, the museums, shops, and galleries in Harvard Square and elsewhere in Cambridge. The combined proximity of so many cultural institutions, colleges, public spaces, and performance outlets, with the University's own College of Fine Arts, College of Communication, University Professors Program, and other on-campus sources for cultural energy, has enabled BU to cultivate a thriving creative community. The George Sherman Student Union on Commonwealth Avenue hosts concerts and performers at &quot;BU Central&quot; and Metcalf Hall. BU is home to the <a>Huntington Theatre Company</a> at the BU Theatre as well as <a>Boston Playwrights' Theatre</a>, and hosts campus and non-campus performances in the Tsai Performance Center.  Visiting artists' work are displayed in rotating exhibitions in the University's three galleries.</p>
<h4>Guest and visitor policies</h4>
<p>Prior to September 2007, Boston University had a rather restrictive visitor policy, which limited the ability of students from different dormitories to visit each other at night. This changed when a new policy approved by Brown took effect.  The new policy allows for students living on campus to swipe into any on-campus dormitory between the hours of 7a.m. and 2a.m. using their ID cards  Student residents can also sign in guests with photo identification at any time, day or night.  Overnight visitors of the opposite sex are no longer required to seek a same-sex &quot;co-host&quot;. However during the week before final exams no guests are permitted in the halls overnight, and are expected to be out of the hall by 2 am.</p>
<h4>Accessing Boston University</h4>
<p><a>thumb|right|The Campus Trolley food truck on the corner of Granby Street and Commonwealth Avenue. The BU College of Arts and Sciences building is visible in the background</a></p>
<p>Most of the buildings of the main campus are located on or near Commonwealth Avenue. The Kenmore Square area of campus (including the Boston University Bookstore, Shelton Hall and Myles Standish Hall) may be accessed using the Kenmore Station Stop on the <a>MBTA</a> Green Line <a>B</a>, <a>C</a> and <a>D</a> trains. Most of the rest of the main campus may be accessed using the B trains of the Green Line between the <a>Blandford Street</a> and <a>Babcock Street</a> stops.  The 57 Bus runs along Commonwealth Avenue and into Allston and Brighton. The <a>MBTA Commuter Rail</a> <a>Framingham/Worcester Line</a> also stops near campus at Yawkey Station.</p>
<p>The Medical Campus is served by the 1 and CT1 Buses which runs along Massachusetts Avenue as well as the 47 and CT3 buses which connect the Boston University Medical Center with the Longwood Medical Area. The Silver Line Washington Street Branch runs the entire length of the campus, one block north of most parts of the campus; it connects Boston University Medical Center with Tufts/New England Medical Center and downtown Boston. The nearest underground T station is the Massachusetts Avenue station on the Orange Line, located 3 blocks north of the Medical Center.</p>
<p>The Boston University Shuttle (BUS) serves to connect the Charles River Campus, Boston University Theater, and the Medical Campus.</p>
<h4>Sustainability</h4>
<p>Boston University's sustainability committee is working to &quot;reduce energy consumption and decrease waste across the campus by concentrating on four crucial areas: recycling and waste management, energy efficiency, sustainable building development and operations, and communications, education, and outreach.&quot; One of the University's early steps toward creating a greener campus was implementing tray-free dining, which saved both water and cash. &lt;BR&gt;Due to its location in the capital of Europe, home to the <a>European Union</a> and <a>NATO</a>, the school places a strong emphasis on international business, and the student body comprises a diverse range of nationalities and cultures.</p>
<h4>Dubai Campus</h4>
<p>The University opened a new dental school in Dubai, UAE in 2007.  The new dental program admitted its first group of students in July, 2008. In addition to BU&#x2019;s dental facilities, the campus will eventually contain a wellness center, private clinics, and a major teaching hospital. &quot;Dubai Healthcare City is a free medical zone within the Emirate of Dubai, has been developed as a world-class, academic medical community, which will be developed around the Harvard Medical School Dubai Center, Boston University Institute for Dental Research and Education, and a major university hospital&quot;, according to Kathi Ferland, director of admissions at GSDM.[<a>http://www.budubai.ae/</a>],</p>
<h4>London Campus</h4>
<p>Boston University's largest study abroad program is located in London, England.

The University's mark on the Report Card has improved steadily since 2007.  In that year it earned a &quot;D&quot;, and in 2008 it earned a &quot;C.&quot; &lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>Cost</h3>
<p>The 2010&#x2013;2011 school year full-time tuition totaled $39,314 with exceptions to some schools. The total cost (including room and board) averages $52,574. Compared to the previous year, the school has made a 3.65 percent increase in the price of tuition, room and board. It is the smallest hike in price since 1969. In addition, the increase of tuition resulted to a 12 percent increase in financial aid for students. President Brown said in an e-mail addressed to the student body that &quot;efforts to control costs and maintain quality have been successful.&quot; </p>
<p>The standard on-campus housing component of this cost is approximately $8,000 a year while more premium choices in the newer Student Village residence halls run nearly $13,000 a year.</p>
<h3>Grade deflation</h3>
<p>The independently-run student newspaper at Boston University, <em><a>The Daily Free Press</a></em>, as well as <em><a>The New York Times</a></em>, have published articles exploring the existence of grade deflation. <em>The Times</em> discovered that administrators have suggested to faculty members deflated ideal grade distributions. Though an article in the staff's <em>BU Today</em> asserted that &quot;the GPAs of BU undergrads and the percentage of As and Bs have both risen over the last two decades,&quot; the <em>New York Times</em> has found BU grades rising more slowly with respect to many other schools.</p>
<p>Currently, the average GPA of a BU undergraduate is 3.04, compared to the averages of 3.35 for Boston College, 3.48 for Amherst College, 3.41 for New York University and 3.45 for Harvard University. About 81 percent of all grades earned in either the A or B range (75% in the B range).&quot; The article went on to note that although the university attempted to curb grade inflation and inconsistency in the late 1990s both the percentage of &quot;A's&quot; and GPAs have been rising since. They attributed the grade inflation not to teachers' grading policies, but to the increasing quality of each incoming class which leads to more top grades.</p>
<h3>Journals and publications</h3>
<p>Boston University is home to several academic journals and publications. The <a>School of Law</a> hosts six nationally recognized law journals, including the <em>Boston University Law Review</em>, <em>American Journal of Law and Medicine</em>, <em>Review of Banking &amp; Financial Law</em>, <em>Boston University International Law Journal</em>, <em>Journal of Science and Technology Law</em>, and <em>Public Interest Law Journal</em>. The <a>School of Education</a> houses <em>The Journal of Education</em>, which is the oldest continuously published journal in the field of education in the country. The <em>American Journal of Media Psychology</em> and the <em>Public Relations Journal</em> are currently edited by professors at the <a>College of Communication</a>, which is also home to the <em>New England Center for Investigative Reporting</em>, which generates numerous publications yearly. <em>Studies in Romanticism</em> is housed at the Department of English and <em>The Journal of Field Archeology</em> is housed at the Department of Archeology in the <a>College of Arts and Sciences</a>.</p>
<h3>Special academic programs</h3>
<h4>Core Curriculum</h4>
<p>Offered in the College of Arts and Sciences, the Core Curriculum offers an intensive <a>great books</a> program for any incoming freshmen who choose to participate.  Occupying two classes a semester during freshman and sophomore years, the program has four humanities sections which start with <a>Gilgamesh</a> and work their way through <a>Plato</a>, <a>Aristotle</a>, <a>Aeschylus</a>, <a>Machiavelli</a>, <a>Shakespeare</a>, Milton, Dante, Bach and many more.  The Social Sciences part of the program includes Hobbes, <a>John Locke</a>, Rousseau, Adam Smith, Marx, and continues through contemporary works.  Lastly, the science aspect of the program deals with major ideas such as big bang theory, evolution, quantum mechanics and more.  Ultimately, the program seeks to combine science, math, humanities, art, and the social sciences into a cohesive program to give students insight into their world and help them become more refined writers and scholars.</p>
<h4>University Professors Program</h4>
<p>The <a>University Professors Program</a> (UNI) is an interdisciplinary program that allows students to pursue a broad range of academic interests. With a student to faculty ratio of 4:1, UNI offers students a broad education in a more personalized atmosphere. Students take a common, intimate, &quot;Core&quot; program consisting of liberal arts courses taught by University Professors in small seminar settings. They then work closely with an advisor to craft a course of study which will lead them to an interdisciplinary degree, culminating in a senior thesis. Based upon the report of an academic review committee, a new University-wide honors program will be developed and the UNI program will be gradually phased out. Students currently enrolled will continue in the program.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<h3>Student publications</h3>
<p>Despite a Student Activities policy which prohibits student-run publications from receiving University funding for printing costs, student journals continue to thrive at Boston University as department-sponsored publications, edited by students under the supervision of faculty and staff advisors. The coordinator for undergraduate publications, responsible for acquainting new editors with University guidelines and directing publications staff to campus production and financial resources, has been Zachary Bos of the Core Curriculum since 2006.</p>
<p>Although officially and entirely independent from the University, <em><a>The Daily Free Press</a></em> (often referred to as <em>The FreeP</em>), is the campus student newspaper, and the fourth largest daily newspaper in Boston. Since 1970, it has provided students with campus news, city and state news, sports coverage, editorials, arts and entertainment, and special feature stories. <em>The Daily Free Press</em> is published every regular instruction day of the University year and is available at BU dorms, classroom buildings and commercial locations frequented by students.</p>
<p><em>Synapse</em> is the Boston University Undergraduate Science Magazine and is published online every semester. The &quot;Science&quot; focus is on many disciplines ranging from life sciences to physical sciences, engineering to mathematics, and finance to economics. The magazine is peer and faculty reviewed, and is advertised with routine, campus-wide distribution of pamphlets highlighting featured articles. <em>Synapse</em> was first published in the spring of 2009 and continues to publish articles each semester.</p>
<p><em>The Brownstone Journal</em> is the longest-running campus publication, having been publishing undergraduate research, scholarly articles and essays, and literary work in translation, since 1982. The Brownstone is currently sponsored by the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program, but was originally a departmental publication of the University Professors Program. The staff operates from their offices in the former yearbook space in the basement of 10 Lenox Street, beneath the editorial offices of <em>Bostonia</em>.</p>
<p>The literary arts magazine <em><a>Clarion</a></em> has been printed since 1998. The first issue, titled &quot;?&quot;, was published by the group Students for Literary Awareness with the sponsorship of the Department of English; subsequent issues have been issued by the BU Literary Society. <em>Burn Magazine</em> is a younger literary magazine, published biannually.</p>
<p>In 2006, the first issue of <em>Pusteblume</em> journal of translation was published by a group of former and current students of a co-curricular poetry seminar run by Professor George Kalogeris of the Core Curriculum. The journal, jointly sponsored by the Department of Romance Languages, the Department of Modern Languages and Comparative Literatures, and the Core Curriculum, publishes literature in translation and articles concerning translation.</p>
<p><em>The Journal of the Core Curriculum</em> has been published continuously since 1992 by the College of Arts and Sciences Core Curriculum. Produced by a student editorial staff with the guidance of a faculty advisor, the very interdisciplinary Core Journal publishes academic prose, literary imitations, fictitious encounters between figures from the 'great works', original poetry and creative writing, essays, artwork, translations, and even&#x2014;in Vol. XVI, Spring 2007&#x2014;original musical compositions. <em>The Back Bay Review</em> is a student-run journal of critical writing.</p>
<p><em>Arch&#x00e9;</em> is an annual journal of undergraduate work in philosophy, whose first issue was released in the summer of 2007. It is sponsored by the Department of Philosophy and published by the Undergraduate Philosophy Association.</p>
<p><em><a>The International Relations Review</a></em> began in 2009 as a subsidiary publication of The Boston University International Affairs Association. Entirely student-run, <em>The IR Review</em> is an independent scholarly journal publishing articles from all areas in international affairs. The goal of <em>The IRR</em> is to unite the many talents and experiences within BU's vast department of international relations.</p>
<p>Even more independent, <em>The Student Underground</em>, focuses on alternative political and cultural activity. Since 1997, issues have been published roughly monthly by a &quot;not-for-profit collective&quot; composed mostly of BU students. In 2007, the paper began operating under the name <em>The Boston Underground</em>; the original editorial focus on campus issues has over the years weakened as the founding editors graduated from BU or left Boston altogether.</p>
<p><em>The Sam Adams Review</em> was a short-lived monthly student newspaper &quot;providing news for the American Spirit,&quot; geared toward a conservative readership. Its staff was not officially recognized as a registed student activity group but, like the Underground, was entirely student-run.</p>
<p><em><a>Boink</a></em> was launched in February 2005 by a group of undergrads led by Alecia Oleyourryk, who was then a senior at the College of Communications. The magazine features BU students posing nude, as well as articles on sexuality. At the time of its first issue, the Dean of Students issued a statement explaining that &quot;the University does not endorse, nor welcome, the prospective publication Boink.&quot; The magazine was then, and remains, unaffiliated with the University.</p>
<p>In September 2005, the student paper <em>The Source</em> began to appear weekly, and was characterized by a predominance of arts and entertainment coverage. No new issues were printed after November 2006, and it appears the publisher Greenline Media is now defunct.</p>
<p>The &quot;<a>BU Quad</a>&quot; is an independent, student-run online magazine started in fall of 2009. The magazine features articles and columns on topics including campus news, television, food, politics, and music.</p>
<h3>Community Service Center</h3>
<p>The <a>Boston University Community Service Center</a> (CSC) is almost entirely student-run. Each semester, the CSC runs <a>13 volunteer programs</a> related to issues of local, national, or global concern, including hunger, children, elders, disabilities, homelessness and affordable housing, human rights, AIDS awareness, gender issues, and the environment.</p>
<p>The CSC also runs two immensely popular one-week programs.  During the <a>First Year Student Outreach Project</a> (FYSOP), upperclassmen lead groups of new freshmen in volunteer activities throughout Boston before the start of first semester.  For <a>Alternative Spring Break</a> (ASB), hundreds of students travel by 12-passenger van, bus and fly to locations throughout the country to do service projects in a variety of areas of need.  In the past students camped out, starting the day before signups, to get spots on trips. Starting in 2010 registration process moved on-line.</p>
<p>The CSC boast the most student involvement of any organization on campus. Today, BU is one twenty five colleges and universities in the country to host all three ROTC programs &#x2013; Army, Navy, and Air Force. Students wishing to be commissioned into the Marine Corps study as Navy Midshipmen.</p>

<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p>[[Image:Inside Agganis Arena.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Inside [[Agganis Arena]] after a hockey game.]]  </p>

<p>The Boston University men's hockey team is the most successful on campus, and is a storied college hockey franchise, with five NCAA championships - including the 2009 NCAA title, which was a classic last-minute comeback victory.  The team is coached by hall-of-famer Jack Parker, and is a major supplier of talent to the NHL, as well as to the 1980 U.S.A. Gold Medal-winning men's hockey team.  Boston University's hockey team has won 29 <a>Beanpot</a> titles, over half of all 57 Beanpot championships thus far.

The university used the nearly $3 million from its football program to build the multimillion-dollar John Hancock Student Village and athletic complex. Among the biggest benefactors of the decision was BU women, who saw the funding for their teams increased. &quot;By implementing the total plan, we can achieve a much more balanced set of sports programs for both men and women, which is consistent with the philosophy underlying Title IX,&quot; said former BU athletic director Gary Strickler.</p>
<h3>Club sports</h3>
<p>Boston University students also compete in athletics at the club level. Thirty five club sports are recognized by the university, including: Synchronized Skating, Baseball; Inline Hockey; Men's Volleyball; Women's Volleyball; Men's Lacrosse; Snowboard; Ultimate Frisbee; Kung Fu; Fencing; Rugby Football; Synchronized Swimming; Cheerleading; Table Tennis; Women's Water Polo; Men's Water Polo; Women's Rugby; Alpine Ski Racing; Snowboarding; Cycling; Badminton; Ballroom Dance; Figure Skating; Golf; Gymnastics; Jiu Jitsu; Kendo; Shotokan Karate; Sailing; Triathlon; Dance Theater Group; Squash, Equestrian, and Men's Club Football</p>

<p>Due to the lack of a football team since 1997,  students use the word &quot;ice&quot; instead of &quot;field&quot; in the seventh line at hockey games, and &quot;court&quot; at basketball games.</p>
<p>Additionally, in the &quot;unofficial&quot; version of the song, often sung by students, the words &quot;Fight! Fight! Fight!&quot; are replaced with &quot;BC sucks!&quot;, a nod to the ice hockey rivalry between the two schools.</p>
