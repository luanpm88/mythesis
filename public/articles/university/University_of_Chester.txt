<p>The <strong>University of Chester</strong> is a <a>university</a> based in the city of <a>Chester</a> in the <a>United Kingdom</a>. The University, based on a main <a>campus</a> in Chester and a smaller campus in <a>Warrington</a>, offers a range of <a>foundation</a>, <a>undergraduate</a> and <a>postgraduate</a> courses, as well as undertaking <a>academic research</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The University was founded as Chester Diocesan Training College in 1839 by a distinguished group of local leading figures in the <a>Church of England</a>, including future <a>Prime Ministers</a> <a>William Ewart Gladstone</a> and the <a>14th Earl of Derby</a>. It was the UK's first purpose-built <a>teacher training college</a>, which makes it one of the longest established <a>higher education</a> institutions in the country. In 1842, Gladstone opened the College's original buildings for its first intake of ten male student teachers on the Parkgate Road site, just outside the City Walls, that the University occupies today.</p>
<p>In 1921, Chester formally became an affiliated college of the <a>University of Liverpool</a> From then on, the College continued to grow steadily. By the 1960s,  as the UK was massively expanding its higher education capacity in reaction to the <a>Robbins Report</a>, the College was considered as a possible candidate for university status. These proposals, however, weren't followed through.</p>
<p>The College continued to expand. Women were first admitted in 1961. In 1963, the government renamed teacher training colleges to colleges of education, so Chester's name became Chester College of Education in 1963. In 1974, the number of courses was expanded beyond teacher education to include <a>Bachelor of Arts</a> and <a>Bachelor of Science</a> degrees. To reflect its wider remit, the College was renamed Chester College of Higher Education.</p>
<p>In the early 1990s, The School of Nursing and Midwifery (now the Faculty of Health and Social Care) was established. This was followed by the right to award its own research degrees in 2007 and, following the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise, a significant proportion of the University&#x2019;s research was declared to be of international quality, with a proportion of 'World Leading' research in History (15%), English, Sports Studies, and Drama (each 5%).</p>

<h2>Students and staff</h2>
<p>Most of Chester's 15,000 students are from the UK, with a quarter being mature students. There are twice as many female students as male (partially due to the number of nursing, midwifery and teaching students).  The small number of foreign students are mainly participants in the university's active exchange policy. There are approximately 1,400 members of staff, 553 of whom are academic. Many of them take part in research and often publish their work through the institution's own publishing house, Chester Academic Press. The review of the staff's research in the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise was positive: each of the ten Units of Assessment contained work that was internationally excellent, with world-leading work in several areas, including Drama, Dance and Performing Arts, English Language and Literature, History, and Sports-Related Studies. These results have led to a large increase in the University's Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) research funding from &#x00a3;338,000 in 2008-09, to &#x00a3;790,000 in 2009-10.</p>
<p>Dr Peter Blair and Dr Ashley Chantler edit <em>Flash: The International Short-Short Story Magazine</em>, a major literary periodical, which publishes stories and reviews of up to 360 words by writers from around the world. Contributors have included: Ama Ata Aidoo, Roberta Allen, Beryl Bainbridge, Elleke Boehmer, Dave Eggers, David Gaffney, Rodge Glass, Michael Cawood Green, Allan Kolski Horwitz, Liesl Jobson, James Kelman, J.

<h2>Chester Students' Union</h2>
<p>Chester Students' Union (CSU) offers services and provides facilities for students and is a member of the <a>NUS</a>. Three sabbatical officers are elected each year. For the 2010-2011 term, is President, Dechlan Jarrett, the Vice-President for the Chester campus, Jack Mason and the Vice-President for the Warrington campus, Sam Wright. Sabbatical officers serve a maximum of two years.</p>
<p>The Executive Committee are the trustees of the Union. Members are elected each year before the end of March and each has a different role, such as Entertainments representative, Welfare and Campaigns representative and Publications representative. The support staff for the Union consists of a number of full-time employees, part-time student staff and volunteers from the elected Executive Committee and the Union Council.</p>
<p>The Union runs bars (CH1 on the main campus) as the previously known 'Padgate Union Bar' on the Warrington campus was in August 2010, taken over by the university. The Union also has three shops. Two are on the Chester campus, consisting of a general shop and clothes shop, and these functions are combined into one at Warrington. The Union also runs over 75 sports clubs and societies; with each campus having its own teams, many of which compete in <a>British Universities and Colleges Sport</a> competitions. Once a year, the Union runs an inter-campus competition known as <em>Varsity</em> on campus where sporting societies, such as seven-a-side football, and non-sporting societies, such as poker, compete. Other non-sporting societies include the Drama Society, the <a>Amnesty International</a> Society and the <a>People and Planet</a> Society. A <a>student radio</a> station, <em>The Cat 1251AM</em>, is based on the Warrington campus and broadcasts daily, with presenters on air from September until June.</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>The University of Chester generally enjoys a good reputation, with The Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (QAA) 2010 audit commending the University for its good practice in ensuring standards and enhancing the quality of learning opportunities, the supportive relationships that underpin the learning and working in the institution and the strength of its partnership work however it has come under fire from the local community recently due to the controversial purchase of Cheshire County Hall. The Faculty of Education and Children's Services also celebrated an 'outstanding' outcome of its recent Ofsted inspection of Initial Teacher Training. The University was ranked =79 in The Guardian 2011 University Guide and 81 in the Complete University Guide 2011. The University's Geography and Development Studies degrees achieved 100% in the National Student Survey and the University has been described as 'building up a solid reputation in a number of subjects beyond education' by <em>The Times</em>. It is ranked as 7th best university in North West England (out of 11 institutions).</p>
<p>In 2007, the Sunday Times released averages of all its tables over 10 years, ranking Chester as 78th in the country (out of 119 institutions) from 1998 - 2007.</p>

<h2>Coat of arms</h2>
<p>The University's coat of arms was granted by the <a>College of Arms</a> in 1954. The arms, pictured above, are made up of an <a>argent</a> shield featuring the <a>St George's cross</a> on which there is a golden wheatsheaf, representing the Earldom of <a>Cheshire</a>. In the first quarter of the shield is a clasped open book, symbolising learning. The <a>crest</a> features a <a>mitre</a>, signifying the institution's founding by the Church of England, in front of two crossed swords, which are taken from the County of Cheshire's coat of arms. The golden scroll contains the <a>Latin</a> <a>motto</a>, &quot;<em>qui docet in doctrina</em>&quot;, an extract from <a>Saint Paul</a>'s <a>epistle</a> to the Romans and translates as &quot;he that teacheth, on teaching&quot; or &quot;let the teacher teach&quot;.</p>
