<p>The <strong><a>State University of New York</a> at Potsdam</strong>, also known as <strong>SUNY Potsdam</strong>, or, colloquially, Potsdam, is a public university located in the <a>Village of Potsdam</a> in <a>St. Lawrence County, New York</a>. Founded in 1816, it is among the 50 oldest colleges in the United States. It is composed of the College of Arts &amp; Sciences, the School of Education and Professional Studies, and the <a>Crane School of Music</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Potsdam was founded by Benjamin Raymond in 1816 as the <strong>St. Lawrence Academy</strong>. In 1835, the academy was chosen by the New York State Legislature to exclusively offer a <a>teacher education</a> program for its senatorial district. With funds from the state, and from support by preceptor Reverend Asa Brainerd, the first diploma in teaching was given in 1836, thus beginning the academy's and eventually the college's longstanding tradition of excellence in the field of teacher education.</p>
<p>In 1866, the State Legislature ended its funding of teacher education departments in private academies, and began establishing several <a>normal school</a>s throughout the state. The Village of Potsdam was thus named as one of four locations for new normal schools, and in 1867, the St. Lawrence Academy became the <strong>Potsdam Normal School</strong>.</p>
<p>By 1886, the Potsdam Normal School made history by becoming the first institution in the United States to offer a normal training course for public school music teachers in the United States. Founded by <a>Julia E. Crane</a>, the <strong>Crane Normal Institute of Music</strong> continues today as the world-renowned <a>Crane School of Music</a> as a leader in the field of <a>music education</a>.</p>
<p>The <a>State University of New York</a> was founded in 1948, and Potsdam became one its founding members, and was thus renamed <strong>New York State Teachers College at Potsdam</strong>. In 1964, the college's mission changed to providing multiple programs, and the university adopted its current name.</p>
<p>During the 1980s, despite the college's traditional strengths in music and education, the college gained recognition for its quickly blossoming mathematics program under the guidance of Dr. <a>Clarence F. Stephens</a>. Known as the <a>Potsdam Miracle</a>, Stephens transformed a practically non-existent department to having the third largest number of mathematics majors of any institution in the United States during his tenure.</p>
<p>The college has a total enrollment of approximately 4,500 students and approximately 930 freshmen entered Potsdam in 2010. That is the biggest first-year class since 1982, and an 11.4 percent increase over last year&#x2019;s incoming freshman class, which had 835 students.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>The campus is located in the small village of Potsdam, near the <a>United States-Canadian border</a>. It is situated in the <a>St. Lawrence Valley</a>, between the <a>St. Lawrence River</a> and the foothills of the <a>Adirondack Mountains</a>. It is located about 10 miles northwest of the border of the <a>Adirondack State Park</a> in <a>Parishville</a>. </p>
<p>The school sits on  and consists of 44 buildings. Barrington Drive runs through the center of the campus, with all academic buildings on the northwest side of the street, and all campus life and residence buildings on the southeast side. The Crane School of Music campus is located in the northern part of the campus, east of the academic quad. </p>
<p>The college has two libraries, the <strong>Frederick W. Crumb Memorial Library</strong> in the center of the academic quad, and the <strong>Crane Music Library</strong>, located in Schuette Hall at the Crane complex. The college also has six performance facilities, The College Theater and the Black Box, both of which are in Satterlee hall, and the dance studio in Dunn Hall, plus three that serve the Crane School, an art gallery, and the <strong>Maxcy Hall Athletic Facility</strong>.</p>
<h2>Student activities</h2>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p>The SUNY-Potsdam men's ice hockey team competed in the <a>NCAA</a> for 25 years, from 1976 to 2009. Most recently they played in the <a>State University of New York Athletic Conference</a> , which is a <a>Division III</a> <a>athletics conference</a>. </p>
<h3>ROTC</h3>
<p>Many SUNY Potsdam students participate in the <a>Army ROTC</a> and <a>Air Force ROTC</a> programs. Students can apply for ROTC scholarships to the university, and may commission as officers in the United States military upon graduation.</p>
<h4>Army ROTC</h4>
<p>SUNY Potsdam is a partner school of the Golden Knight Battalion, one of 272 Army ROTC Battalions in the United States. SUNY Potsdam students are the second largest group represented in the battalion, which is composed of approximately 100 ROTC Cadets. The headquarters for the Golden Knight Battalion is at 16 Elm St. in downtown Potsdam, where it has been located for decades.</p>

<h2>Potsdam Miracle</h2>
<p>The <strong>Potsdam Miracle</strong> refers to the unusual success of the <a>Mathematics</a> Department at <a>SUNY Potsdam</a>, USA, under the guidance of Dr. <a>Clarence F. Stephens</a>, in attracting large numbers of students to become successful mathematics majors. For example, in one year, about 25% of the degrees conferred by Potsdam were in mathematics and over 40% of the institution&#x2019;s <a>honor students</a> were mathematics majors. The 184 majors in that year was the third largest number of colleges and universities in the <a>United States</a>.</p>
<p>Seven of the eight <a>valedictorian</a>s for the period 1980&#x2013;1987 were mathematics majors.  No student who graduated from SUNY Potsdam between the time of its founding in 1816 and the arrival of Stephens in 1969 is known to have subsequently earned a <a>Ph.D.</a> in mathematics. However, twelve students who graduated during Stephens's tenure are known to have done so, half of them women.</p>
<p>The Potsdam Miracle confirmed the effectiveness of the Potsdam Model of mathematics education. The model is based not on lowering student standard but in raising teaching standards.</p>
<p>In explaining the program in Dilip Datta's book <em>Math Education at its Best: The Potsdam Model</em>, Dr. Stephens said that his primary goal was to create the most favorable possible conditions for students to learn and for faculty to teach. He and a team of other student-oriented faculty members taught a course, &quot;How to Read Mathematics Literature with Understanding and to Become Independent Learners,&quot; to students early in their study of mathematics. For undergraduates that was typically in the freshman or sophomore year, while for graduate students it was during their first year.</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>The Potsdam Model is &#x201c;based on the premise that the study of pure mathematics can be undertaken successfully by a large number of students if they are provided with a supportive environment including: careful and considerate teaching by a well-trained and dedicated faculty, continual encouragement, successful (student) role models, enough success to develop self-esteem, enough time to develop intellectually, recognition of their achievement, and the belief that the study is a worthwhile endeavor.&#x201d;</p>
<p>Stephens had largely developed his ideas and earlier implemented them at Morgan State College (now <a>Morgan State University</a>). Although no graduates of Morgan are known to have ever received a Ph.D. in mathematics, nine did so during his tenure there. Hence, the Potsdam Model is sometimes called the Morgan-Potsdam Model.</p>
