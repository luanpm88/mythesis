<p> <strong>Lund University</strong> (), located in <a>Lund</a> in the province of <a>Scania</a>, <a>Sweden</a>, is one of northern Europe's most prestigious <a>universities</a> and one of <a>Scandinavia</a>'s largest institutions for education and research, frequently ranked among the world's top 100 universities. The university was founded in 1666 and is the second oldest <a>Swedish university</a>, but can arguably trace its roots back to 1438, when a <a>studium generale</a> was founded in Lund.</p>
<p>Lund University has eight <a>faculties</a>, with additional campuses in the cities of <a>Malm&#x00f6;</a> and <a>Helsingborg</a>, with 27,780 students in more than 274 different programmes and 2000 separate courses. It belongs to the <a>League of European Research Universities</a> as well as the global <a>Universitas 21</a> network.</p>
<p>The university traditionally centers on the <a>Lundag&#x00e5;rd</a> park adjacent to the <a>Lund Cathedral</a>, with various departments spread in different locations in town, but mostly concentrated in a belt stretching north from the park connecting to the university hospital area and continuing out to the northeastern periphery of the town, where one finds the large campus of the <a>Faculty of Engineering</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>[[Image:Universitetsbyggnaden 080508.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lund University main building]], built in 1882 by <a>Helgo Zettervall</a>.]] The city of <a>Lund</a> has a long history as a center for learning and was the ecclesiastical centre and seat of the archbishop of <a>Denmark</a>. A <a>cathedral school</a> (the <em><a>Katedralskolan</a></em>) for the training of clergy was established in 1085 and is today Scandinavia's oldest school </p>
<p>A <em><a>studium generale</a></em> (a <a>medieval university</a> education) was founded in 1425, but had to close in 1536 in connection with the Danish <a>reformation</a>.</p>
<p>After the <a>Treaty of Roskilde</a> in 1658, the <a>Scanian lands</a> came under the possession of the Swedish Crown, which quickly founded the Lund University in 1666 as the means of Swedification. It was the fifth university under the Swedish king, after <a>Uppsala University</a> (1477), the <a>University of Tartu</a> (1632, now in <a>Estonia</a>), the <a>Academy of &#x00c5;bo</a> (1640, now in <a>Finland</a>), and the <a>University of Greifswald</a> (founded 1456; Swedish 1648&#x2013;1815, now in <a>Germany</a>). It is the second-oldest university on Swedish ground today.</p>
<p>The university was named <em>Academia Carolina</em> after <a>Charles X Gustav of Sweden</a>. The name was in some formal use until the late 19th century, when Lund University became the widespread denomination.</p>
<p>[[Image:Esaias tegner lundagard 080508.jpg|thumb|[[Esaias Tegn&#x00e9;r]] statue near the towering <a>Lund Cathedral</a>.]] The university was at its founding granted four faculties: <a>law</a>, <a>theological</a>, <a>medicine</a> and <a>philosophy</a>. They were the corner stones, and for more than 200 years this system was in effect. Towards the end of the 17th century, the number of students hovered around 100. Some notable professors in the early days were <a>Samuel Pufendorf</a>, a juridical historian; and <a>Canutus Hahn</a> and <a>Kristian Papke</a> in philosophy.</p>
<p>The <a>Scanian War</a> in 1676 led to a shut-down, which lasted until 1682. The university was re-opened largely due to regional patriots, but the university was not to enjoy a high status until well into the 19th century. Lecturing rooms were few, and lectures were held in the <a>Lund Cathedral</a> and its adjacent chapel. The professors were underpaid.</p>
<p>In 1713, <a>Charles XII of Sweden</a> entered Lund. He stayed in Lund for three years, in between his warlike expeditions. The town of Lund and the university attracted a temporary attention boost. The most notable lecturer during this time was <a>Andreas Rydelius</a>.</p>
<p>Peace was finally restored with the death of Charles XII in 1718, and during the first half of the 18th century the university was granted added funds. The number of students was now well around 500. Despite not being on par with Uppsala University, it had still built a solid reputation and managed to attract prominent professors.</p>
<p>Around 1760 the university reputation dropped as the number of students fell below 200, most of whom hailed from around the province. However, by 1780 its reputation was largely restored, and continued to rise through the 1820s. This was largely owing to popular and well-educated lecturers particularly in philology; the prominent professor <a>Esaias Tegn&#x00e9;r</a> was a particularly notable character with widespread authority. He, in turn, attracted others towards Lund. One of these was the young theological student <a>C. G. Brunius</a>, who studied ancient languages under Tegn&#x00e9;r and were later to become professor of Greek. With time he was to devote himself to architectures and he redesigned several of Lund's buildings, as well as churches of the province.</p>
<h3>Women at the university</h3>
<p>The first woman to study in Lund was the medical student Hedda Andersson who entered the university in 1880 (two years before the next woman to do so). Hilma Borelius was the first woman who finished a doctorate in Lund, in 1910. The first woman to be appointed to a professor's chair was the historian <a>Birgitta Od&#x00e9;n</a> (1965). In 1992 <a>Boel Flodgren</a>, Professor of Business Law, was appointed <a>rector magnificus</a> (or, strictly speaking, <em>rectrix magnifica</em>) of Lund University. As such, she was the first woman to be a head of a European university.</p>

<h2>Library</h2>
<p><a>thumb|University Library</a> Lund University library was established in 1666 at the same time as the university and is one of Sweden's oldest and largest. Since 1698 it has received <a>legal deposit</a> copies of everything printed in the country. Today six Swedish libraries receive legal deposit copies, but only Lund and the <a>Royal Library</a> in Stockholm are required to keep everything for posterity. Swedish imprints make up half of the collections, which amount to 170,000 linear metres of shelving (2006). The library serves 620,000 loans per year, the staff is 200 full-time equivalents, and the 33 branch libraries house 2600 reading room desks.</p>
<p>The current main building at Helgonabacken opened in 1907. Before that, the old building was <em><a>Liberiet</a></em> close to the city's cathedral. Liberiet was built as a library in the 15th century, but now serves as a cafe.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<p>Lund student life is based on three central structures: the student nations, Akademiska F&#x00f6;reningen (AF) and the student unions.</p>
<p>Since July 1st, 2010, it is no longer required to enroll in a student union, nation or AF in order to to receive grades at the university.  Students may still enroll in these organizations if they wish.</p>
<h3>Student Nations</h3>
<p> The <a>nations</a> in Lund are a central part of the university's history, initially serving as <a>residential college</a>s for students, organized by geographic origin. <a>&#x00d6;stg&#x00f6;ta Nation</a>, the oldest nation, was established in 1668, two years after the university was founded. While the nations still offer limited housing, today they are best described as <a>student societies</a>.</p>
<p>Today students may enroll in any nation, although the nations still preserve their geographic names. In most cases it does not matter what nation one enrolls in, but different nations offer different activities for interested students.</p>
<p>Each nation has student housing, but the accommodations in no way meet demand, and they are usually appointed according to a queue system. Each nation has at least one pub evening per week, with a following night club. The solemn peak event in the course of an activity year is the organization of student balls once a year. Most well known of the nation balls (as opposed to balls organized by fraternities or student unions) is the ball hosted by G&#x00f6;teborgs Nation - called the &quot;Gustaf II Adolf Ball&quot; (also known as the &quot;GA-Ball&quot;). Most nations also host at least one <a>banquet</a> per week, where a three course dinner is served. Each nation also has different activities for students interested in sports, arts, or partying. All activities within the nations are voluntary.</p>
<h3>Akademiska F&#x00f6;reningen (AF)</h3>
<p><a>thumb|upright|<em>AF-Borgen,</em> the student-run complex at the heart of student life in Lund, May 2002.</a> In 1830, Professor <a>Carl Adolph Agardh</a> formed <em>Akademiska F&#x00f6;reningen</em> (The Academic Society), commonly referred to as AF, with the goal of &quot;developing and cultivating the academic life&quot; by bringing students and faculty from all departments and student nations together in one organization. Prince <a>Oscar I</a>, then Sweden's Chancellor of Education, donated 2000 Kronor to help found the society. In 1848, construction began on <em>AF-Borgen</em> (the AF Fortress), which is located opposite the <a>Main Building</a> in <a>Lundag&#x00e5;rd</a>. To this day, AF is the center of student life in Lund, featuring many theater companies, a prize-winning student radio (<a>Radio AF</a>), and organizing the enormous <em>Lundakarnevalen</em> (the Lund Carnival) every four years. &quot;AF Bost&#x00e4;der&quot;, an independent foundation with close ties to Akademiska F&#x00f6;reningen, maintains over 5,700 student residences in Lund.</p>
