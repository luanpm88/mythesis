<h2>History</h2>
<p>Hamburger University was founded in 1961, at a McDonald's restaurant in <a>Elk Grove Village, Illinois</a>. In the early 1960s, the first students had to complete strictly required courses such as chemistry, marketing, and cooking so that when they graduated, they would be able to create formulas to increase the profit of the company. Many of those with a &quot;McDegree&quot; were able to get jobs in a lab where they could invent new ways to enhance the food in an economical way.</p>
<h2>Popular Culture</h2>
<p>Hamburger University was satirized in the 1986 comedy <em><a>Hamburger... The Motion Picture</a></em>.</p>
