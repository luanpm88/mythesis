<p>In the first year, core subjects such as Marketing, Accounting, Finance, Economics and Organizational Behavior are covered. In the second year, the Marketing and IT papers are compulsory, and students pick a major in Human Resource or Finance. The institute also offers other courses that take an unconventional look at the disciplines of business managament. The postgraduate program has 1920 contact hours.

<h3>GOTA programme</h3>
<p>All students of the institute are sent on a 21-day compulsory trip to European countries to study under the Global Opportunities and Threat Analysis (GOTA) programme. The GOTA programme arranges visits of the institute's students to multinational firms and political organizations.</p>
<h3>Relationships with other educational institutions</h3>
<p>In 2008, professors from <a>National University of Singapore</a>, <a>Singapore</a> conducted a seven week course at the institute on Investment Banking for the top hundred students from IIPM leading to a joint certification in investment banking. In 2006, it was reported that IIPM collaborated with <a>Stanford University</a>'s Centre for Professional Development organised a strategy workshop in New Delhi. However, Stanford has stated &quot;Neither the Stanford Graduate School of Business nor the office of Stanford Executive Education has ties of any kind with IIPM.&quot; The Mercator School of Management, Duisburg-Essen University, has a formal partnership with IIPM for exchanging students and faculty, and conducting joint research. The Ecole Sup&#x00e9;rieure du Commerce Ext&#x00e9;rieur lists IIPM as a partner institution, which enables their students to study their curriculum at IIPM.</p>
<p>In 2009, <a>Judge Business School</a>, <a>University of Cambridge</a>, <a>Darden Graduate School of Business Administration</a>, <a>University of Virginia</a> and <a>Haas School of Business</a> hosted IIPM's non-credit Executive Education program participants and conducted sessions for them. The school also wrote a letter to IIPM clarifying that a previous relationship does not allow IIPM to call itself a &quot;partner school&quot; with Cambridge. Darden school has also clarified that it does not have a partnership agreement with IIPM.</p>
<h3>Accreditation</h3>
<p>The school's programmes are not accredited by Indian regulatory bodies such as <a>AICTE</a> (whose accreditation is a voluntary process) Prior to the settlement, the <a>fine print</a> at the bottom of advertisements of IIPM stated that the institute does not come under the purview of the UGC or AICTE. The acting Chairman of UGC Prof V N Rajshekharan Pillai in 2005 argued that the advertisements can be &quot;misleading&quot;. According to the institute, it has not sought <em>de jure</em>recognition from any statutory body or accrediting authority. In October 2005, the University Grants Commission (and the AICTE later on) raised objections over IIPM offering technical degrees. The institute clarified that it never offered the MBA, BBA degrees. These are offered by IMI, Belgium, a not-for-profit business school whose programs are unaccredited. Students who complete the certificate courses become eligible to optionally apply for MBA/BBA degrees from the International Management Institute (IMI) Belgium or IMI's post graduate degrees. IMI awards degrees to the institute's students as IMI has recognised the course structure of the institute. The alliance also enables the institute's students to visit IMI as part of student exchange programmes for one semester. It was reported in 2002 that extending the tie-up, IMI will also now confer its PhD awards to the institute's research fellows. As per a Careers 360 article, NVAO, the accreditation organization for Netherlands and Flanders, has clarified that IMI &quot;is not a recognised higher education institution in the Dutch or French speaking part of Belgium&quot; and cannot award recognised degrees. NVAO further mentions in the article that &quot;BBA and MBA degrees cannot be awarded legitimately. Graduates that use the title Bachelor or Master can even be prosecuted. Using those titles without holding a legitimate degree is illegal.&quot; In 2009, IIPM filed a criminal defamation charge against Careers 360. In May 2010, the court upheld that the contents of the Careers 360 article were &quot;prima facie defamatory&quot; and issued bailable warrants against Maheshwar Peri, publisher Careers 360 and Outlook, and Mahesh B Sarma, editor of Careers 360 magazine. &lt;!-- The Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi, India, officially lists IIPM as one of the management institutes operating out of Delhi. --&gt; Nevertheless, UGC and AICTE declared IIPM to be a fake university not permitted to confer MBA and BBA degrees; IIPM filed a lawsuit in response. In June 2008, UGC and IIPM reached an agreement in the Delhi High Court, with UGC agreeing to remove IIPM's name from the fake universities list, and IIPM agreeing to clarify that it offers only &quot;certificate courses&quot;. In July 2010, UGC issued a notice to IIPM, after the Andhra Pradesh State Council of Higher Education questioned IIPM on the authenticity of its Hyderabad courses. UGC Chairman Ved Prakash commented that IIPM was advertising its programmes using the names of UGC, HRD Ministry and AICTE and that &quot;it is indulging in cheating.&#x201d; IIPM Group President for Corporate Affairs Amit Saxena said the institute wasn&#x2019;t a university, was not empowered to award degrees on its own, and neither was doing so. IIPM is the &quot;on-site academic partner of M S University which grants its degrees to IIPM students.&#x201d; Saxena also said that IIPM had made representations to UGC and Andhra Pradesh State Council of Higher Education to &#x201c;clarify the stand,&#x201d; and that the subject was &quot;sub judice at the Delhi high court.&quot; The registrar of MS University, a [[University Grants Commission (India)|UGC]] recognized university,</pre>
<p>The <a>University of Buckingham</a> has announced the signing of a <a>Memorandum of Understanding</a> in March 2009 with the institute, mentioning that the University of Buckingham is working together with the institute &quot;towards the final accreditation of IIPM's BBA and MBA programmes.&quot; In June 2009, Careers 360 wrote that a representative for the University of Buckingham had clarified to them that although they are in talks with IIPM, there is no formal agreement yet; and that until IIPM's program are formally accredited by the QAA, IIPM does not have consent to mention University of Buckingham in its advertisements. A Career 360 article also said that after they published their second article, IIPM removed the name of University of Buckingham from their advertisements. The institute highlights rankings prominently in its ads. A ranking of business schools released by <a>Outlook magazine</a> in 2003 ranked the institute 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; on Industry Interface, 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; on Industry Interface and 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; on Extra Curricular Activities. But the magazine later in 2005 issued a notice withdrawing the rankings saying the institute misguides students through unethical practises and does not disclose facts truthfully. According to Arindam Chaudhuri, Honorary Dean of IIPM, this was done after Arindam pointed out Outlook's usage of perception qualitative rankings to influence b-school ranks. Post this, according to Arindam, IIPM responded with legal action against Outlook</p>
<p>The 2008 Zee Business Best B-School Survey ranked IIPM 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; overall, 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; in Global Exposure, 15&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; in Infrastructural Facilities, 9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; in Course Content, and 9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; in Placements. The 2009 Zee Business Best B-School Survey ranked IIPM 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; overall.  In November 2009, IIPM's Delhi branch was ranked #9 amongst India's top ten private schools by Hindustan Times Mail Today's August 2010 commissioned perception survey ranked IIPM amongst the top ten b-schools in the Delhi-NCR region. In February 2010, IIPM was awarded for its &quot;innovative teaching methodology&quot; in the 2010 DNA &amp; Stars of the Industry group&#x2019;s Innovative B-School Awards.</p>
<h2>Job placement</h2>
<p>According to the institute, only 70 percent of its students opt for the placement process, and that almost all of these 70 percent students get jobs through it. ICICI was the biggest recruiter and IBM was the &quot;Star recruiter&quot;.  In 2007, according to IIPM's placement cell, its students got placed in over 200 companies. In 2007, it was reported that IIPM and other b-school graduates were getting &quot;fabulous offers from top notch firms.&quot; According to IIPM, in 2007, &quot;over 200 companies listed under Fortune 500, multi-national corporations and start-ups recruited students.&quot; In 2009, B. Mahesh Sarma reported in a Career360 article that for the class of 2008, three companies - Standard Chartered, Barclays and Deutsche Bank - which are mentioned in IIPM advertisements as participants in campus placement, said that although they might have a few freshers of the institute working for them, they have never participated in the institute's campus recruitment process. In the said Careers 360 article, B. Mahesh Sarma profiled a sample of jobs that IIPM said students get abroad in places like the gulf countries; in the article; Mahesh requests the reader to make his/her own judgement on the international jobs offered.</p>
<p>In June 2009, Mail Today, an India Today group publication reported that the institute got jobs for 2,300 out of 4,000 students with 750 companies participating, and 46 international placements, with the results of 100 campus interviews still being awaited. The average annual pay package was INR 420,000, which was reported to be a good figure given the recession. According to the institute, financial service companies and small and medium enterprises participated in placements in 2009.</p>
<p>In June 2010, it was reported that more than 10,000 IIPM students have been placed in the last five years in more than 1,500 companies; and more than 250 students have got international placements in the last three years, a new benchmark. IIPM Delhi got the highest number of global placements in India for 2008 (165 students placed globally) and 2009 (55 students). The August 2010 Mail Today commissioned perception survey noted that biodatas mentioning IIPM will be &quot;be kept on top of the pile&quot; by HR managers. carried an article by Arjun Ravi  (named<em>IIPM: Tall Claims</em>) where he claimed that IIPM's advertisements were misleading. Arjun Ravi also stated that IIPM uses rankings from 2003. Ravi's article was published before these rankings were withdrawn by the Outlook C-Fore B-School survey in July 2005. IIPM sent a legal notice to Sabnis, eventually resulting in Sabnis being forced to resign from his job. IIPM also is said to have threatened to burn laptops purchased from IBM, where Sabnis was working at that time. Businessworld India magazine, of which Rashmi Bansal is a contributing editor, in its October 2005 issue, covered the issue. The magazine reported that facilities including the swimming pool, 300-seater auditorium, seven amphitheatre classrooms, and mini golf course were restricted to IIPM's Delhi campus only. IIPM, in response to these findings, stated that &quot;We have only one campus. The rest are branches.&quot; The magazine also reported that the average age of IIPM faculty is 27 years, and the international faculty mentioned in IIPM's advertisements only gave one-time lecture to the students. Both Arjun Ravi at JAM and Businessworld stated that the institute did not provide them with detailed statistics on student placement. The <a>Outlook magazine</a> covered the legal tussle between the IIPM and other bloggers.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Trade practices</h3>
<p>In May 2007, The Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission (MRTPC), an anti-monopoly watchdog, initiated a probe into IIPM's advertisements. They stated that they suspected that IIPM recovers the cost of GOTA tours and laptops (both advertised as free for the students) from students later on.</p>
<p>In October 2007, MRTPC announced that they would not be processing enquiry against many business schools due to &quot;shortage of staff.&quot;</p>
<h3>UGC and AICTE objections</h3>
<p>In October 2005, both UGC and AICTE raised objection over IIPM using the term 'Indian Institute' as part of its name. The UGC also said that the IIPM cannot give MBA and BBA degrees as these can only be given by universities recognised by the UGC. In March 2007, AICTE issued another notice to institutions offering unauthorised courses including IIPM. IIPM stated it has not, and will not apply for AICTE recognition as its programmes fall out of the purview of AICTE. According to Careers 360, the Uttarakhand government appointed Registrar of the Uttarakhand Technical University to conduct an inquiry, who has recommended banning IIPM. In 2009, IIPM filed a criminal defamation charge against Careers 360.</p>
<h3>Tax issues</h3>
<p>In May 2007, S.S. Palanimanickam, Minister of State for Finance, answered a question in the Rajya Sabha raised by Dharam Pal Sabharwal, another Rajya Sabha member, &quot;IIPM has not paid income tax during the assessment years 2005-06 and 2006-07, claiming exemption under section 10(23C) (vi) of the Income-tax Act, 1961.&quot; The Ministry further stated that service tax paid by IIPM in the preceding two years had been nil. Under a query raised through the <a>Right to Information Act</a> on the institute, the Central Board of Direct Taxes had said that the ministry did receive a &quot;tax evasion complaint in respect of wrong claims of exemption under Section 10 (23C) of the Income Tax Act, 1961.&quot;</p>
<p>In April 2009, the Indian government clarified that there were &quot;no pending tax claims against IIPM&quot; and the case had been closed after due enquiry.</p>
<h3>Plagiarism</h3>
<p>In August 2006, a <a>USA Today</a> article about plagiarism on the internet mentioned that a column by <a>Jack</a> and <a>Suzy Welch</a> was posted on the IIPM website below Arindam Chaudhuri's photo without attributions to either <a>BusinessWeek</a> or Jack and Suzy Welch. IIPM subsequently informed USA Today that it had rights to the Welch column through the New York Times News Service/Syndicate, and that a Welch byline was added after the USA Today inquiry because, &quot;others could be confused.&quot;</p>
<h3>Allegations of conspiracy against leftists</h3>
<p>In December 2009, IIPM released full-page advertisements in national newspapers, announcing awards for <a>Mamata Banerjee</a> and other personalities critical of the <a>CPIM</a>(Communist Party of India, Marxist). The advertisements referred to CPIM as &quot;Stalinist&quot; and applauded awardees for efforts against the Stalinist &quot;clutches&quot;. The CPIM was furious over these ads and came down heavily against IIPM in its party mouthpiece. It alleged that IIPM was providing funds as a part of an imperialist conspiracy against the Left. The article also alleged that IIPM was being funded by the US Government. Furthermore, one of the awardees, legendary author <a>Mahasweta Devi</a> said that although she was named in the ad as a recipient of the award, she had not been contacted by IIPM about it, and she had no knowledge of the institute.</p>
