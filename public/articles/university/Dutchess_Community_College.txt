<p>  <a>400px|thumbnail|Taconic Hall</a> <strong>Dutchess Community College</strong> (also known as <strong>SUNY Dutchess</strong>, <strong>Dutchess</strong>, or <strong>DCC</strong>) is one of 30 community colleges within <a>the State University of New York system (SUNY)</a>. The College, located in Dutchess County, is situated on  on a hill above <a>Poughkeepsie, New York</a>. The College was founded in 1957 on the site of a former <a>tuberculosis</a> hospital which now makes up Bowne Hall, the campus's main administrative building. The College offers more than 60 academic programs leading to associate degrees or certificates. In addition, the Office of Community Services and Special Programs provides non-credit courses, GED completion, ESL classes, and work-force training to residents of the County and beyond.</p>
<p>One-third of all <a>Dutchess County</a> high school graduates attend Dutchess Community College. Of the more than 35,000 DCC alumni, the majority live and work in the <a>Hudson Valley</a>[<a>http://www.suny.edu/Student/downloads/Pdf/2008_viewbook_cc.pdf</a>] and many of them have become civic and community leaders in their towns, villages and counties. </p>
<p>In 2008, the College marked its 50th Anniversary. Since enrolling its first class in 1958, DCC has awarded degrees and certificates to over 35,000 graduates and has provided educational opportunities for many thousands of other students.</p>
