<p> The <strong>State University of New York at Oswego</strong>, also known as <strong>Oswego State</strong> and <strong>SUNY Oswego</strong>, is a <a>public university</a> in the <a>City of Oswego</a> and <a>Town of Oswego</a>, <a>New York</a>, on the shore of <a>Lake Ontario</a>. It is a member institution of the <a>State University of New York</a> <a>system</a>.</p>
<p>Founded in 1861 as <strong>Oswego Primary Teachers' Training School</strong> by <a>Edward Austin Sheldon</a>, in 1942 the <a>New York Legislature</a> elevated it from a <a>normal school</a> to a <a>degree</a>-granting <a>teachers' college</a>. The <strong>New York State Teachers College at Oswego</strong> was a founding member of the State University of New York system in 1948. In 1962 Oswego broadened its scope to become an arts and sciences institution. SUNY Oswego has over 73,000 living alumni. SUNY Oswego now consists of four colleges an schools: the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences; the School of Business; the School of Education; and the new School of Communications, Media and the Arts, launched in 2008. </p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>thumbnail|right|300px|Campus as viewed from Glimmerglass Lagoon</a> Originally founded in the city of Oswego by Sheldon to train teachers to meet pressing educational needs, the college moved to its current location on the shore of Lake Ontario in 1913 after <a>Sheldon Hall</a> was constructed. The current campus is located on  along Lake Ontario.  Development of the campus was planned by the architectural firm of <a>Skidmore, Owings and Merrill</a>, who designed the major buildings.</p>
<p>The campus today consists of 46 buildings with classroom, laboratory, residential and athletic facilities. Recent years have witnessed the launch of a $700 million campus-wide renovation and renewal program, with the new Campus Center acting as the social hub of campus.</p>
<h3>Campus Center Complex</h3>
<p>The college's new social hub known as the Campus Center Complex, which opened in fall 2007, includes new construction and renovation of the existing Swetman/Poucher complex. The $25.5 million  Campus Center portion, the new construction, includes a convocation hall and <a>ice arena</a>, food court, box office, fireplace lounge, breakfast nook and reservable spaces. The renovated portions of the building house The Compass (student services); The Point (student involvement); a student media center with <a>WNYO</a>, <a>WTOP</a> and <a>The Oswegonian</a> newspaper; Copy Center; and Fresh&#x00eb;ns Cafe.  Academic departments in the Campus Center include English and creative writing, modern languages and literatures and philosophy, while the Office of Learning Services stands ready to assist students who need help outside the classroom. In addition, the <a>College Honors Program</a> is located in the Campus Center.</p>
<h3>Other buildings</h3>
<p>Physically separate from the main campus is the south campus, consisting of Laker Hall (indoor sports, coaching classrooms, and athletic training rooms), Romney Fieldhouse (home of the Laker hockey program until fall 2006) and several athletic fields. In addition, more than  of Rice Creek Field Station (for biological research and public programs).</p>
<p>A variety of living option are available through 11 residence halls: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Lakeside Area: Scales, Waterbury, Riggs and Johnson Halls. Riggs and Johnson were recently renovated; the latter is the home to the First-Year Residential Experience.</li>
  <li>West Campus, commonly called &quot;New Campus&quot;: Cayuga, Seneca, Oneida and Onondaga Halls</li>
  <li>Main Campus: Hart Hall Global Living and Learning Center, Funnelle Hall</li>
  <li>Mackin Complex: Lonis and Moreland Halls</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to a shortage in residential rooms in fall 2008 caused by greater enrollment and on-campus living requests than expected, several rooms were offered in renovated conference/hotel space in Sheldon Hall. A new townhouse village with apartment living is under construction south of Glimmerglass Lagoon, with a fall 2010 opening date projected.</p>
<p>Fewer than  from Johnson Hall is Shady Shore. Shady Shore was the home of college founder Dr. Edward Austin Sheldon. It often has served as the residence for the college president throughout the years, including the tenth and current president, Deborah F. Stanley.</p>
