<p>  <strong>Transylvania University</strong> (also referred to as <strong>Transylvania</strong> or <strong>Transy</strong>) is a private, <a>undergraduate</a> <a>liberal arts college</a> in <a>Lexington</a>, <a>Kentucky</a> founded in 1780. The school offers 38 majors as well as pre-professional degrees in engineering and accounting. The university is accredited by the <a>Southern Association of Colleges and Schools</a>.</p>
<h2>Name</h2>
<p>Transylvania, meaning &quot;across the woods&quot; in <a>Latin</a>, is most commonly referred to as &quot;Transy.&quot; The name stems from Transylvania University's initial founding, within the heavily-forested region of western Virginia known as the <a>Transylvania colony</a>, which became most of Kentucky in 1792.</p>
<p>While Transylvania does not take its name from the <a>Transylvania region</a> in central Romania, the college does use this unique naming connection in celebration. Elements of <a>Dracula</a> can be seen on campus, predominantly in the week of Halloween during Rafinesque Week.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Early years (1780-1865)</h3>
<p>Transylvania University opened in 1780, after the Virginia Assembly adopted a charter establishing <strong>Transylvania Seminary</strong>. Originally in a log cabin in <a>Boyle County</a>, <a>Kentucky</a>, the school moved to Lexington in 1789. After 1818, the university included a <a>medical school</a>, a <a>law school</a>, a <a>divinity school</a>, and a college of arts and sciences.</p>
<p>The other major institution that aided in the creation of the modern Transylvania University was Bacon College, named after <a>Sir Francis Bacon</a>, which would later be known as <strong>Kentucky University</strong>.  Bacon College existed from 1837&#x2013;1851, founded by the <a>Christian churches</a> in Kentucky. Bacon College was a new entity separated from <a>Georgetown College</a>, a <a>Baptist</a> supported institution, but Bacon College inevitably closed due to lack of funding.  Seven years later, in 1858, Bacon College's charter was amended to establish Kentucky University, and moved to donated land in <a>Harrodsburg</a>, <a>Kentucky</a>.</p>
<h3>Modern era (1908-present)</h3>
<p>In 1988, Transylvania University experienced an infringement on the institution's trademark when Hallmark Cards began selling Transylvania University T-shirts. The product, developed for the 1988 Halloween season, was intended to be a novelty item purporting to be college wear from Count Dracula's fictional <em>alma mater</em>. When contacted by the actual Transylvania University, Hallmark apologetically admitted that they were not aware of the Kentucky-based institution and recalled all unsold product immediately. <a>The Princeton Review</a> ranked Transylvania 1st among colleges with a &quot;Major Frat and Sorority Scene.&quot;  In 2009, <a>Forbes</a> ranked it 85th of <a>America's Best Colleges</a>.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>The college is located on a 48-acre (19.4 hectare) campus about 4 blocks from downtown <a>Lexington</a>, <a>Kentucky</a>. It has 24 buildings, 3 athletic fields, 3 dining areas, and a National Historic Landmark . The campus is divided in two by North Broadway, with the east side of Broadway containing the university&#x2019;s academic buildings, and the west side containing the majority of the residential buildings.  </p>

<h4>J. Douglas Gay Jr./Frances Carrick Thomas Library</h4>
<p>Originally completed in 1952 with a dedication from <a>President Dwight D.

The books belonging to the Transylvania Medical Department, which closed in 1859, are now kept in special collections.</p>
<h3>Residential buildings</h3>
<h4>Thomson Hall</h4>
<p>The newest residential building on campus, Thomson Hall was opened in the fall of 2008. It received <a>ENERGY STAR</a> rating in 2009. It serves as a residential building for upper-class students that meet a certain GPA requirement and features 31 suite style living-units which include study areas, living rooms, kitchenettes, bathrooms, and bedrooms. The building is three stories tall, has 28,000 square feet of space, and cost $5.5 million.

<h5>1780 Caf&#x00e9;</h5>

<h3>Other buildings</h3>
<h4>Old Morrison</h4>
<p>&lt;!-- linked from redirect [[Old Morrison}}--&gt; Built in 1833 under the supervision of <a>Henry Clay</a> who was serving as Transylvania&#x2019;s law professor, Old Morrison is the main administration building for the university. It is a <a>National Historic Landmark</a> and is featured on the city seal of Lexington. It houses the offices of financial aid, the president, admissions, the registrar, communications, accounting, alumni, development, and sustainability. During the <a>Civil War</a>, Old Morrison served as a hospital for Union and Confederate soldiers. Old Morrison was gutted by fire in 1969 but was renovated and reopened in 1971. The building also houses the tomb of <a>Constantine Rafinesque</a>, who was a natural science professor at the university from 1819 to 1826, and Sauveur Francois Bonfils, who taught at the university from 1842-49. A native of <a>France</a>, he was apparently forced to flee due to political discord.</p>
<h4>Glenn Building</h4>
<p>The Glenn Building was constructed as a multi-purpose building in 2005 and houses the campus bookstore, a coffee shop, and expansion space for the library. It was named in honor of James F. Glenn, a Board of Trustees member who donated $1.1 million for its construction. It utilizes an environmentally friendly geothermal heating and air conditioning system and several mature trees near the site were preserved during construction.</p>
<h2>Student activities</h2>

Each chapter is represented on either the Interfraternity Council (fraternities) or the Panhellenic Association (sororities).  In its 2011 edition of &quot;The Best 373 Colleges&quot;, the <em><a>Princeton Review</a></em> named Transylvania number 1 on its list of colleges with &quot;A Major Frat or Sorority Scene&quot;  In 2010, the school was named number 1 in percentage of Greek students on campus.</p>

<h2>Traditions</h2>
<h3>Rafinesque Week</h3>
<p>Thanks to Transylvania&#x2019;s unusual name and the on-campus tomb of two 19th-century professors, Halloween has become a week-long celebration at Transylvania. Known as Rafinesque Week in honor of the 19th-century botanist, inventor, and Transylvania professor <a>Constantine Rafinesque</a>, the college ends October with a unique combination of activities including ghost stories, a haunted house, a flag football tournament, and a lottery for four students to win the chance to spend the night in Rafinesque&#x2019;s tomb.</p>
<h3>Orientation Weekend</h3>
<p>The weekend before classes start in the fall is known as Orientation Weekend. During this time new students move in before upperclassmen, and are given the opportunity to learn about the campus and customs of Transylvania. They take part in community building exercises including a serenade of the first-year women by the first-year men on the steps of Old Morrison and a greet line, where every first-year student goes down the line and shakes hands with every other first-year student.</p>
<h3>Kissing Tree</h3>
<p>Just outside of the library, there stands a white ash tree estimated to be approximately 260 years old, 35 years older than the university itself. In the 1940s and 1950s, the administration turned a blind eye to couples kissing in public here, at a time when it was frowned upon elsewhere on campus. The romance of the site developed further as a tradition of couples kissing under the tree grew. Today, with the rules on public displays of affection slackened, the tradition isn&#x2019;t as significant as it once was, but alumni from the 1940s and 1950s remember what the tree represented for them. Students today still refer to the tree as the Kissing Tree. In 2003 <em><a>The Chronicle of Higher Education</a></em> included the Kissing Tree among the most romantic places on college campuses in America and it was mentioned in a <em><a>Wall Street Journal</a></em> article about romance on college campuses.</p>
