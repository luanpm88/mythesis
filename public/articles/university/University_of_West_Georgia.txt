The University is built on 645 <a>acres</a> (2&nbsp;km&#x00b2;)  including a recent land gift of 246 acres (1&nbsp;km&#x00b2;) from the city of Carrollton in 2003. Off-campus classes are available in <a>Dalton</a>, <a>Newnan</a>, <a>Georgia Highlands College</a> in <a>Rome</a>, and at several other community locations throughout the state. It has an enrollment of about 11,300 students. For the past six years, the University has been named as one of the Best Southeastern Colleges by <a>The Princeton Review</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1933 the school's name was changed to West Georgia College and it became a <a>two-year institution</a>.  West Georgia became a four-year institution in 1957.</p>
<p><a>James E. Boyd</a> became the President of West Georgia College in 1961 after <a>William H. Row</a> (who had held the position a mere nine months) died due to a heart attack. Boyd is most known for peacefully <a>integrating</a> the campus (without waiting for a court order) in 1963 by inviting a young black woman, Lillian Williams, to attend the college; she would eventually earn two degrees in education and earn the college's highest honor, the Founder&#x2019;s Award, in 1985.</p>
<p>In May 1964, Boyd invited <a>Robert F. Kennedy</a> to the dedication of the campus chapel as the Kennedy Chapel, as U.S. President <a>John F. Kennedy</a>'s death had occurred in November 1963. Robert would promote the <a>Civil Rights Act of 1964</a> which was being debated in the <a>United States Senate</a>.</p>
<p>Boyd dramatically expanded the college during his tenure in both headcount and academic diversity. In sheer numbers, there were 1089 students on his arrival and 5503 students on his departure. In 1959, there were two degrees and five programs available; in 1969-70 there were seven degrees and 45 programs. There were 94 graduate students in 1961 and 741 in 1969, due to the first master's programs being offered in 1967.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>The University offers numerous programs of study at the <a>Undergraduate</a>, <a>Graduate</a>, and <a>Post-Graduate</a> levels through the College of Arts and Sciences, the Richards College of Business, the College of Education, the School of Nursing, the Honors College, and the Graduate School.  In addition, the university is one of few in the United States to hold a residential, early entrance to college opportunity for high school juniors and seniors, the <a>Advanced Academy of Georgia</a>. Advanced Academy students take college courses and reside on campus under the supervision of a professional residential staff.</p>
<h3>Psychology program</h3>
<p>The University is unique in that it is one of only two public universities in the United States offering a psychology program with a <a>humanistic</a> and transpersonal focus. In 1967 Mike Arons, a student of <a>Abraham Maslow</a>, <a>Paul Ricoeur</a>, and Jim Klee, became chair of the West Georgia psychology department. Jim Thomas, then on the psychology faculty at West Georgia, and others had asked <a>Abraham Maslow</a> to recommend someone to them to initiate a humanistic emphasis there, and Arons was Maslow's recommendation.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<p>Students have access to more than 99 <a>student organization</a>s covering academics, cultural/international, departmental/educational, professional and honor groups, politics, science, religion, service, recreation and sports, and social <a>fraternities</a> and <a>sororities</a>.</p>
<p>UWG's marching band is known as &quot;The Sound that Lights the South&quot; and consists of over 140 members.  Led by Dr. Douglas Overmier since 2003, it is known for its high energy and athleticism.  Each performance finishes with the band dancing to the final number.  Overmier also leads the Jazz Percussion Group which has performed throughout Europe and the United States as well as jazz festivals and state conferences.  The JPG has brought numerous honors to the university since their beginning in 2003.</p>
<p>The <a>pedestrian</a> <a>campus</a> also includes a <a>library</a> with 561,900 volumes, a gym, <a>computer lab</a>s, <a>tennis court</a>s, <a>baseball</a> fields, <a>soccer</a> fields, a nature trail, a quarter-mile (400 m) <a>running</a> track, a climbing wall, and <a>basketball</a> courts.</p>
<p>The University also operates <a>noncommercial</a> <a>radio station</a> <a>WUWG</a> <a>FM</a> 90.7 <a>MHz</a>. It has been on the air since 1973 (as WWGC until 2001), serving all of <a>Carrollton</a> and <a>Carroll County</a> as well as the <a>student body</a> of the university. Originally a diverse <a>college radio</a> station, it is now a listener-supported <a>public radio</a> <a>affiliate</a> of <a>Georgia Public Broadcasting</a>, <a>simulcast</a>ing the GPB <a>Radio network</a> at most times.</p>
<p>The world's only hand-painted replica of the <a>Bayeux Tapestry</a> is located at the University of West Georgia by the Art Department. It is displayed in the third floor atrium of the Humanities building. This replica was donated to the university by the city of <a>Bayeux</a>, France in 1997.</p>
<h3>Greek Village</h3>
<p>Acting as a small community within the larger UWG community, the newly opened Greek Village features 18 houses ranging in size, complete with a living/chapter room, kitchen, laundry facilities, a mix of single and double bedrooms and semi-private bathrooms. Also included within the village are outdoor green spaces, adequate parking, a commons building and soon an outdoor basketball, volleyball court and pavilion.</p>
<p>The effort to create such a facility allows for the university to not only expand its housing offerings, but also attract new students to UWG, making it more of a destination university. Additionally, within the Greek system at UWG, there are three different governing councils: Panhellenic, Interfraternity and National Pan-Hellenic. In creating the Greek Village, it became possible for these different groups to share a space together for the first time.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p>The athletics program fields men's intercollegiate teams in <a>baseball</a>, <a>basketball</a>, <a>cross country</a>, <a>football</a>, and <a>golf</a> and women's teams in <a>basketball</a>, <a>cross country</a>, <a>golf</a>, <a>soccer</a>, <a>softball</a>, and <a>volleyball</a>. All intercollegiate sports are affiliated with <a>NCAA</a> Division II of the as a member of a member of the <a>Gulf South Conference</a>.  In 2006, amid the <a>Native American mascot controversy</a>, the UWG changed its athletic nickname from the &quot;Braves&quot; to the &quot;Wolves.&quot;</p>
<p>Tim Brooks, former member of the 1999 <a>Gulf South Conference</a> Championship Men's <a>Cross Country</a> team, was named Head Coach of the Men's and Women's teams in 2010.</p>

<h3>University Stadium</h3>
<p><a>thumb|alt=Home side of University Stadium.|Home side of University Stadium.</a></p>
<p>In 2003, the University of West Georgia acquired  from the city of Carrollton for the purpose of creating a stadium and athletic complex. Such a facility would serve a dual role: give UWG sport teams a facility that they could use, and aid the university in its quest to continue to attract additional students. The funding for this venture was made possible through private donations and increased student fees approved by the Student Government Association.</p>
<p>During the summer of 2008, construction began on this facility and, in the fall of 2009, University Stadium opened. The stadium seats roughly 9,000, providing ample space for any sporting or other entertainment event. Additionally, the new athletic complex includes a stadium and practice field for the Wolves&#x2019; soccer program, a new softball stadium and a women&#x2019;s field house with locker-room facilities for both women&#x2019;s sports.</p>
<h3>The Coliseum</h3>
<p> The Coliseum is an on-campus indoor arena in Carrollton, Georgia controlled by Mr. Overseer Boss Hatfield. It is primarily used for basketball and volleyball, and is the home field of the University of West Georgia. The arena holds 6,475 spectators and opened in 2009.  Total construction cost was $24.7 million dollars.[<a>http://den-oweb.petersons.com/ccc92/display_pdf?p_instance_id=183749.pdf</a>]</p>
<p>The concourse level of the facility includes a two-story lobby that offers an area for event pre-function gatherings.  The concourse level also features concession stands and restrooms.</p>
<p>The lower level of the facility houses the floor of the arena, spacious locker rooms for the men and women basketball teams, the volleyball team, visiting teams, and referees.  Additionally, this level includes a trainer&#x2019;s facility.  The Coliseum has a maple wood floor surrounded by seating and a four-sided, state-of-the-art video scoreboard suspended over center court.</p>
<p>The upper level includes three large skyboxes for UWG officials, boosters, and friends to gather during events.</p>
<p>The Coliseum hosts UWG commencement ceremonies, concerts, and other various events.
