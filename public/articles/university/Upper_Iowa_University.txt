<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left|Alexander Dickman Hall, built in 1855, is the oldest building on the Fayette Campus and constructed of native limestone.</a> In 1854, Elizabeth Alexander, a pioneer woman living near what is now Fayette, Iowa, proposed the idea of a college to her husband, Robert, who donated $10,000 toward the cause.  Their son-in-law, Samuel Robertson, donated $5,000 and  of land.  In 1856, the first Board of Trustees meeting was held; <a>articles of Incorporation</a> were adopted; and classes began January 7, 1857.</p>
<p>In 1860, a company of male students and faculty members enlisted in the Army to fight in the <a>American Civil War</a>. Student-soldiers participated in 17 major battles, carrying a flag hand-sewn by UIU women students.  In 1917, UIU male students joined the armed forces during <a>World War I</a>, while women students organized <a>American Red Cross</a> classes on campus; the UIU gym became a barracks, and the athletic field was the scene of military drills.  By 1920, a systematic program of extension work throughout northeast Iowa had begun, with Upper Iowa referred to as &quot;a pioneer in the field&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Alderson, S. 1965. <em>The Palimpsest</em> (Vol. XLVI, No.3, pg. 166/167.&lt;/ref&gt;  Those students who joined the service to fight in <a>World War II</a> took advantage of the <a>G.I. Bill</a> to complete their education, which dramatically increased Upper Iowa enrollment between 1947 and 1950.  Record enrollments were also seen after the <a>Vietnam War</a> (1952-1970).&lt;ref&gt;Regan, S. 2008. The Pioneering spirit: <em>Upper Iowa University celebrating 150 Years 1857-2007</em>.

<p>In 1972, Upper Iowa launched an external degree program that included an Independent Study and Online Programs.  In 1984 to present, UIU expanded to open Center locations across the U.S.   Upper Iowa was approved by North Central to offer graduate degrees in 1995, and finally in 1999 started its International Program by establishing centers in <a>Hong Kong</a>, <a>Singapore</a>, <a>Malaysia</a>, and <a>Vancouver, Canada</a>.<a>thumb|right|The Andres Center for Business and Education was built in 2004</a></p>
<p>It was also during 1994 to 2003 that UIU underwent an aggressive landscaping and building renovation that brought changes to its Fayette Campus.  This included the construction of Lee Tower Residence Halls, the acquisition of a new physical plant building and the construction of a recreation center.  In 2004, the new Andres Center for Business and Education was built, and Alan G. Walker was appointed the 20th president of the University.   During summer 2009, the largest capital improvement project broke ground on the Fayette campus&#x2014;$75 million&#x2014;which will include a new student center, suite-style housing, and a Liberal Arts academic building.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.uiu.edu/newhomepage.html</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
