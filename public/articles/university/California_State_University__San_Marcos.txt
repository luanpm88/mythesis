<h2>History</h2>
<p>Efforts by community and political leaders to attract a state university to <a>North County</a> date back to 1968. In 1978, state legislator William A. Craven (1921&#x2013;1999) won state funding for a North County satellite campus of <a>San Diego State University</a>. In 1989, Gov. <a>George Deukmejian</a> signed another Craven bill which established a CSU campus in San Marcos.</p>
<p>The state purchased land in San Marcos, including the former Prohoroff Poultry Farms chicken ranch. The hillside site lies approximately 8 miles (13&nbsp;km) due east of the <a>Pacific Ocean</a> and 35 miles (40&nbsp;km) due north of downtown San Diego. Today the campus comprises 304 acres (123 ha).</p>
<p>Bill Stacy was appointed president in June 1989. During the 1989-1990 academic year, Stacy hired 12 &quot;Founding Faculty,&quot; who played an important role in the university's early years and today are memorialized in Founders Plaza.</p>

<p>A large majority of the student population comes from the San Diego and Riverside County areas. Approximately 600 students live in on-campus residence halls.

<p>According to a local newspaper and the 2007-2008 Clery Report on Crime Awareness and Campus Security, CSU San Marcos is a safe campus with a relatively low crime rate. The University&#x2019;s police department employs a variety of crime prevention and safety education programs to keep the campus safe. In 2008, seven gang members were arrested at an off-campus, privately-operated apartment complex located next to the University. Originally, there were concerns that this gang was selling drugs to students. However, as a result of the efforts of the local sheriff&#x2019;s department and the apartment&#x2019;s new security team, the gang appears to have vacated the apartment complex.</p>

In 2007, the softball program's second year, the school hired former UCLA All-American Kelly Warren who was previously the Associate Head Coach at nearby San Diego State University. <a>Steve Scott</a> (aka &quot;The Miler&quot;) is the Cougars' Cross Country and Track &amp; Field coach.  In Fall 2009, the Women's Cross Country team won their first NAIA National Championship. They went on to defend their title the next year in Fall of 2010.
