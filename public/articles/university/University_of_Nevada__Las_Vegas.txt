<p></p>
<p><strong>University of Nevada, Las Vegas</strong> (<strong>UNLV</strong>) is a <a>public</a>, <a>coeducational</a> <a>university</a> located in the <a>Las Vegas</a> suburb of <a>Paradise, Nevada</a>, <a>USA</a>. The  <a>campus</a> is located approximately  east of the <a>Las Vegas Strip</a>. Groundbreaking on the original  site was in April 1956, and the university purchased a  site in <a>North Las Vegas</a> for future expansion. The institution includes a Shadow Lane Campus, located just east of the <a>University Medical Center of Southern Nevada</a>. The <a>university</a> has been deemed a &quot;research-intensive university&quot; by <a>The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The first <a>college</a> classes which would eventually become the classes of UNLV were offered as the southern regional extension division of the <a>University of Nevada</a>, in 1951 in a classroom at <a>Las Vegas High School</a>. UNLV was officially founded by the <a>Nevada Board of Regents</a> as the Southern Division of the University of Nevada in 1957. The first classes were held on the current campus on the now historic <a>post and beam</a> <a>Mid Century Modern</a> <a>Maude Frazier</a> Hall designed by the <a>award</a> winning local <a>architectural</a> firm, <a>Zick and Sharp</a>. Thirty <a>students</a> <a>graduated</a> in the first commencement ceremonies in 1964.</p>
<p>In 1965, the Nevada Legislature named the school <strong>Nevada Southern University</strong>, and the Board of Regents hired the campus's first <a>president</a>, <a>William Carlson</a>.</p>
<p>In 1968, Nevada Southern was given equal status with its parent institution in <a>Reno</a>, and the present name was approved by the Regents in January 1969, during a winter session and without input by representatives from the University of Nevada. During this time Nevada Southern University also adopted the southern &quot;Rebel&quot; athletics moniker and a mascot dressed in a southern Confederate uniform named Beauregard. The popular reasoning behind such a controversial moniker and mascot is that they did it to oppose the northern Union traditions and symbols of their northern rival, the University of Nevada. It was not long, however, before protests from NSU/UNLV students forced a slight change to their Confederate mascot, but the &quot;Rebels&quot; moniker remains to this day. Since its founding, the university has grown rapidly, expanding both its academic programs and campus facilities. </p>
<p>In 1969, the Board of Regents approved the school's name change to University of Nevada at Las Vegas and gave it the UNLV abbreviation. In protest of higher-education budget cuts, students created <a>Education City</a> &#x2014; a scrap board shantytown on campus, where professors taught classes for a week. Students effectively communicate their unhappiness to the regents.</p>
<p>In 1971, in a special&#x2013;initiative election, students voted to retain the Rebel name, rejecting suggested alternatives such as Big Horn Rams, Nuggets, A-Bombs, and Sand Burners. Five years later, though, they voted to replace the Confederate wolf mascot with a human Revolutionary War soldier, which eventually evolves into a more geographically appropriate pioneer figure.</p>
<p>In 1973, complaining that UNLV's campus is too flat, Regent Helen Thompson donated $9,000 to build a  hill west of the humanities building. (Part of this hill is now embedded in the back of the alumni amphitheater.) Also, Jerry Tarkanian is hired as the men's basketball coach. In his 19-year career, he will post a 509-105 record, including taking four teams to the NCAA Final Four. In honor of Tarkanian's achievements as UNLV's &quot;winningest&quot; coach, the basketball court at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center is dedicated to him in 2005.</p>
<p>In 1981, a dedication ceremony for <a>Claes Oldenburg</a>'s Flashlight sculpture on the plaza of the performing arts center was covered on the &quot;Evening News with Walter Cronkite,&quot; and the artwork became an instant landmark. It symbolizes UNLV as a &quot;Beacon of Knowledge&quot; in Southern Nevada.</p>
<p>In 1983, The opening of the 18,500-seat Thomas &amp; Mack Center gave the Runnin' Rebels basketball team an impressive home. Kicked off with fundraiser with <a>Frank Sinatra</a>, <a>Dean Martin</a>, and <a>Diana Ross</a>. Sinatra is no stranger to UNLV &#x2014; he, along with Wayne Newton, served on the foundation board in the 1980s. The Hey Reb mascot made his debut, embodying UNLV's rebel spirit. After a makeover in 1997, he is named one of 12 All-American Mascots and places second in the 2004 Capital One Mascot of the year competition.</p>
<p>In 1997, The <a>Paul B. Sogg Architecture Building</a> opened, featuring a library, classrooms, faculty offices,  of studio space, and laboratories, allowing students, who were previously meeting in trailers, to interact at all levels. Paradise Elementary School moved into a new building on campus, giving education majors direct training with real teachers and economically disadvantaged students.</p>
<p>In 2001, The , $58 million <a>Lied Library</a> opened, named for real estate entrepreneur Ernst W. Lied, with a robotic book-retrieval system, hundreds of computer workstations, and the latest in electronic data processing. It is also in this year that the <a>Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching</a> places UNLV in the category of Doctoral/Research Universities-Intensive.</p>
<p>In 2004, UNLV opened its first regional campus in the medical district on Shadow Lane, with a new facility for School of <a>Dental Medicine</a> and the <a>Forensics</a> and <a>Biotechnology Center</a>. The School of Nursing begins a doctoral program to train much-needed nursing professors. To address the critical nursing shortage, the school overhauled its curriculum to enable undergraduate students to complete faster.</p>
<h3>New initiatives</h3>
<p>In 2005, the university received over $95 million in extramural research funding, about a 30 percent increase over the previous year. In addition, a fund raising campaign, &quot;Invent the Future&quot;, passed $300 million in money collected in 2005, with the ultimate goal of raising $500 million. A new  <a>student union</a> and a new  <a>recreation center</a> were both completed in 2007.</p>
<p>In 2006, UNLV opened its first <a>international</a> campus in <a>Singapore</a>. The UNLV Singapore campus is housed on the 10th and 11th floors of the <a>National Library of Singapore</a>, a prestigious building comparable to the <a>United States Library of Congress</a>. The campus offers <a>bachelor&#x2019;s degree</a> programs in Hotel Administration and Hospitality Management. UNLV Singapore is offering the college's upper division courses, which include Hotel Administration, Hospitality Marketing, Food &amp; Beverage Management and Hotel Law. Students may also earn an executive master's degree in hospitality.</p>
<p>In 2008, project iNtegrate was lunched to replace and upgrade the information systems for all institutions in the <a>Nevada System of Higher Education</a> (NSHE). PeopleSoft Campus Solutions from <a>Oracle, Inc.</a> is the product purchased by NSHE to provide important communication and business services to students. iNtegrate will provide students with more self-service capability. They will have better access to their records, including the ability to check bills, look at schedules, and change their addresses. It will be more reliable, easier to use and will allow faculty and staff to meet students' needs for accurate information, timely decisions, and informed choices. The new system will also provide better support for graduate and professional schools. By September 2010, iNtegrate is expected to be fully functional and live.</p>
<p>In 2009, a $59.7 million Advanced Clinical and Research Training Center was constructed under architect Carpenter Sellers. This LEED equivalent building is expected to be completed by summer 2010. It will serve to consolidate the University of Nevada Health Sciences System programs through the shared use of classrooms, teaching labs, and simulated patient lab space.</p>
<h3>Sustainability</h3>
<p>The University of Nevada, Las Vegas has created an Urban Sustainability Initiative that strives to implement sustainable practices both on campus and in the larger Las Vegas community. In addition to having two campus buildings in the process of <a>LEED</a> Silver Certification and one building in the process of LEED Gold Certification, UNLV has reduced its use of electricity and natural gas by 38 percent per square foot since 2001 by retrofitting older campus buildings. In the 2009 edition of the Sustainable Endowment Institute&#x2019;s College Sustainability Report Card, University of Nevada-Las Vegas received a grade of &quot;C&quot;.</p>
<p>The <a>Nevada Policy Research Institute</a> criticized UNLV for spending $90 million on a new campus building called Greenspun Hall stating, &quot;This really looks like a case of misplaced priorities.&quot;</p>
<p>In an effort to stop or at least reduce the budget cuts to UNLV and the rest of the <a>Nevada System of Higher Education</a> (NSHE), rallies were held early 2009 to protest the situation.  Tuition will be raised by 10% for fall 2009 as a partial measure to alleviate Nevada's financial hardship. Resources and amenities aiding students in their research and learning may be cut.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p></p>
<p>UNLV offers over 200 programs of study in varying fields leading to <a>bachelor's</a>, <a>master's</a>, and <a>doctorate</a> degrees, which are taught by approximately 850 faculty members. Notable departments include the <a>School of Architecture</a>, <a>School of Dental Medicine</a>, <a>College of Education</a>, <a>Graduate College</a>, <a>William F.

<p>The <a>Atlantic</a> Monthly recognized UNLV's <a>English Department</a> as having one of the nation's most innovative <a>Master of Fine Arts</a> programs and one of the top five <a>doctoral</a> programs in <a>creative writing</a>.</p>
<p><a>Down Beat</a> Magazine, the internationally-recognized industry standard trade publication for jazz music, recognized the work of the 2010 UNLV Jazz Ensemble as &quot;Outstanding Large Jazz Ensemble Performance&quot; among graduate college-level jazz bands in their annual Student Music Award issue of that year.</p>
<p>The <a>Nevada Policy Research Institute</a> has criticized the UNLV for low graduation rates claiming &quot;A mere 41 percent of students attending the University of Nevada, Las Vegas graduate within six years. UNLV spent $16,537 per pupil in the 2006 academic year.</p>
<p>UNLV also offers <a>Distance Education</a> which extends educational outreach and access of University courses, degree programs, and research opportunities to the local and global communities in an effort to serve a diverse population of students who prefer or need alternative methods of delivery. DE is committed to learner needs and interests by providing exemplary services to the University academic community. As an entrepreneurial and innovative learning technology field, DE is committed to collaborating on research initiatives, faculty development, active learning, measurable outcomes, and using empirically proven pedagogies with emerging technologies to increase the opportunity for successful learning outcomes of UNLV students.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>[[Image:StripFromUNLV.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Las Vegas Strip]] can be seen in the distance from various points on the UNLV campus]] The main campus of UNLV is located on a 332-acre land grant in centrally located Paradise, Nevada Las Vegas. </p>
<p><em>Midtown UNLV</em> is an ongoing private-public development along Maryland Parkway, a border street to the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Development began in 2002 and the purpose is to expand the university to meet the demands of a major university in the <a>Las Vegas metropolitan area</a>. The project is designed to improve the &quot;front door&quot; of the University by improving amenities for students and businesses along Maryland Parkway. The goals are to reduce vacant spaces, lower business turnover rates, as well as create new space for the University to expand. Additionally, the project aims to create new housing developments close to campus. Major funding is through state funding sources along with private donations.</p>
<p>The university has several facilities for the performing arts. The Judy Bayley Theatre, opened in 1972, seats 550 people and features a raked auditorium, a fully-rigged, proscenium stage, and a thrust-apron that can be used as an orchestra pit. The Artemus W. Ham Concert Hall, opened in 1976, seats 1,832 patrons and includes a beautifully decorated lobby complete with a gallery wall of fine art. The Black Box Theatre can accommodate 120&#x2013;175 non-fixed seats in arrangements for small recitals, lectures, dance, and other social events. Other facilities include the Alta Ham Fine Arts Complex, opened in 1982, and the Lee and Thomas Beam Music Center, opened in 2001.</p>
<p>Athletic facilities include <a>Sam Boyd Stadium</a>, <a>Thomas &amp; Mack Center</a>, <a>Cox Pavilion</a>, and <a>Earl Wilson Stadium</a>.</p>
<h2>Information Science Research Institute(ISRI)</h2>
<p>Information Science Research Institute(ISRI) is a research and development unit of <a>University of Nevada</a>. ISRI was established in 1990 with funding from the <a>U.S. Department of Energy</a>. Its mission is to foster the improvement of automated technologies for understanding machine printed documents. </p>
<p>To pursue this goal, ISRI&#x2019;s specific programs have been established:</p>
<p>1.ISRI conducts a program of applied research in recognition of information from machine-printed documents. ISRI&#x2019;s research focuses on developing new metrics of recognition performance, on measures of print quality, on document image enhancement, and on characterization of document analysis techniques.</p>
<p>2.ISRI conducts a program of applied research in Information Retrieval. This research is focused on issues related to the combined use of recognition and retrieval technologies. For example, ISRI are focused on evaluating the effectiveness of different retrieval models in the presence of OCR errors. ISRI are interested in improvements that can be made in the retrieval environment to reduce the effects that recognition errors have on retrieval. Further ISRI are developing systems to automatically tag the physical and logical structure of documents to establish a mapping bet ISRI en the text and the image. This mapping can be exploited in various ways to improve both retrieval and display of documents.</p>
<p>3.Each year, ISRI sponsors a &#x201c;Symposium on Document Analysis and Information Retrieval&#x201d; (SDAIR). This symposium provides a forum for presenting the results of research into improved technologies for document understanding with emphasis on both recognition and retrieval from machine-printed documents.</p>
<p>4.ISRI conducts an annual &#x201c;OCR Technology Assessment&#x201d; program. Each year, using its automated test facilities, ISRI prepares an in-depth, independent comparison of the performance characteristics of all available technologies for character recognition from machine-printed documents. The results of this test are first made public at the SDAIR symposium.</p>
<p>These programs interact very strongly. ISRI expect that continued development of new measures of OCR system performance will contribute to a better understanding of recognition problems.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p>[[Image:Thomas&amp;MackCenterAndCoxPavilion.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Thomas &amp; Mack Center]] and adjoining <a>Cox Pavilion</a> house many of the university's athletic teams.]]  UNLV supports varsity teams in 17 different sports. The University is commonly referred to as the Rebels, or Lady Rebels. The men's basketball team is referred to as the <a>Runnin' Rebels</a> and the men's baseball team is referred to as the Hustlin' Rebels. The Rebels are a founding member of the <a>Mountain West Conference</a>, in the <a>NCAA's</a> Division I.</p>
<p>The school's official colors of scarlet and gray can be traced to the late-1950s when UNLV adopted as mascot a wolf wearing a Confederate uniform. Scarlet and Gray were traditional colors of the Confederacy with its gray uniforms and red-based flag. UNLV's mascot is Hey Reb, the toned down version of the original mascot named Beauregard, which was a wolf character dressed in <a>Confederate</a> hat and uniform. UNLV's Hey Reb mascot made his debut in 1983. He received his first makeover in 1997 and second in 2009. Named one of 12 All-American Mascots, he competed for the title of 2004 Capital One Mascot of the Year and made a strong showing by coming in second in online voting. No stranger to national television, Hey Reb has also appeared in two memorable ESPN SportsCenter commercials. The only exception is the UNLV men's soccer team, which competes in the <a>Mountain Pacific Sports Federation</a>. </p>
<p>UNLV has many traditions in its athletic programs. Each year the men's football team plays the <a>Nevada Wolf Pack</a> in a football game called the <a>Battle for Nevada</a>. The trophy for that game is the <a>Fremont Cannon</a>. Built by the <a>Kennecott Copper</a> Corp., Nevada Mines Division, the cannon is valued at more than $10,000 and is considered one of the best, and loudest, symbols of rivalry in college football.</p>
<p>UNLV is most known for its men's basketball program. Made famous by Coach <a>Jerry Tarkanian</a> in the 1970s&ndash;1990s, the Runnin' Rebels are the third most winning team in Division I basketball history by percentage, only behind Kentucky and North Carolina.(.713, 1037-418 through 2008)  UNLV is well known for their 1990 <a>NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship</a> by defeating <a>Duke University</a> 103-73, which was and still is the largest margin of victory in a championship game. In that same game, UNLV became the first team to ever break 100 points in a championship game.</p>
<p>In recent years,<img> UNLV has returned to the national basketball spotlight under new head coach Mr. <a>Lon Kruger</a>. In five seasons with the Runnin' Rebels, the Rebs have won two Mountain West Conference Tournament Titles. In 2007, the Runnin' Rebels made the Sweet 16, and in 2008 the second round of the NCAA Tournament, losing to the eventual National Champion, the <a>University of Kansas</a>.</p>
<p>UNLV is also well-known for its golf program. Led by coach Dwaine Knight, the UNLV Golf program has turned out PGA Tour pro's such as <a>Adam Scott</a>, <a>Chris Riley</a>, <a>Chad Campbell</a>, <a>Ryan Moore</a>, <a>Skip Kendall</a>, <a>Charlie Hoffman</a>, <a>Bill Lunde</a>, and <a>Andres Gonzales</a>. They won the NCAA National golf team championship in 1998.</p>
<p>As of March 2008, the Rebel men's swimming and diving team has won four straight Mountain West Conference titles. <a>Michael Tylo</a>, soap opera actor; <a>Douglas A. Unger</a>, writer and author; <a>Clarence Gilyard</a>, actor on <a>Walker, Texas Ranger</a>, and <a>Michel Hugo</a>, prolific cinematographer,</p>
