<p>  <strong>Bishop's University</strong> is a small <a>liberal arts university</a> in <a>Sherbrooke</a>, <a>Quebec</a>, <a>Canada</a>. Located in the borough of <a>Lennoxville</a>, Bishop's is one of three universities in the province of Quebec that teach primarily in the <a>English language</a> (the others being <a>McGill University</a> and <a>Concordia University</a> both in <a>Montreal</a>). The university shares a campus with its neighbour, <a>Champlain College Lennoxville</a>, an English language <a>C&#x00c9;GEP</a>.  It remains one of Canada's few primarily undergraduate universities. Established in 1843 as Bishop's College, the school remained under the <a>Anglican</a> church's direction from its founding until 1947. Since that time, the university has been a non-denominational institution.  Bishop's University has a strong academic history, and has graduated fifteen <a>Rhodes Scholars</a>. &lt;/br&gt;</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left|Bishop's University</a> Bishop's College was established by Bishop <a>George Jehoshaphat Mountain</a> in 1843 for the education of members of the <a>Church of England</a> and erected into a University in 1853. The school was originally founded by Bishop Mountain, the third <a>Anglican</a> bishop of Quebec as a liberal arts college. In 1845, instruction began and in 1854, the first degrees were granted.</p>
<p>An act of the Quebec Legislative Assembly ratified its foundation. In 1853, it was established as a university by royal charter bearing the name University of Bishop's College and affiliated to <a>University of Oxford</a> and <a>University of Cambridge</a>. Its charter empowered the University to grant degrees in theology, law, medicine, and fine arts. The Church of England controlled the university until 1947. In the early part of the twentieth century, professional education expanded beyond the traditional fields of theology, law and medicine, while graduate training based on the German-inspired American model of specialized course work and the completion of a research thesis was introduced.  In the fall of 2007 the university announced a strategic research plan which will position &#x201c;Research and Creativity&#x201d; as a central focus for the University&#x2019;s future development, making Bishop's unique among Canadian undergraduate institutions.</p>
<p>As of 2009, Bishop&#x2019;s has 1854 full-time students. The student body represents every Canadian province and territory along with 18 U.S. States and over 50 countries. Known as 'Oxford on the Massawippi' for its architectural style, the campus is significantly influenced by the Gothic Revival period and is home to some of Quebec's most historic buildings, including St. Mark's chapel. Construction on campus began with &quot;Old Arts&quot; in 1846 and continues today with the University's most recent building, Paterson Hall, in 2003. The campus also provided the setting for the films <em><a>Lost and Delirious</a></em> (2001)  and <em><a>The Covenant</a></em> (2006).&lt;br&gt; <a>thumb|left|McGreer Hall</a></p>
<h3>McGreer Hall</h3>
<p>McGreer Hall is named in honour of Arthur Huffman McGreer (1883&#x2013;1947), Principal from 1922 to 1947. Under his leadership, the curriculum in Arts was greatly strengthened, teaching in experimental science was initiated, enrolment was doubled and financial stability and academic autonomy achieved. The original central five bays of the Hall were constructed in 1846, and the Lodge at the west end was added in 1847 as the residence of the first Principal. Following the fire of 1876 which gutted the central block, the Hall was rebuilt with improved facilities, and in 1898, thanks to a fund established in memory of Robert Hamilton, it became possible to extend the third floor from the Lodge to the ante-chapel and to add the central tower. In 1908 the Lodge was converted to student and faculty use and in 1909 the Library wing was added.</p>
<h3>Bishop Williams Hall</h3>
<p><a>thumb|left|Bishop Williams Hall</a> James William Williams (1825&#x2013;1892) was appointed headmaster of Bishop's College School in 1857. In 1863 he was consecrated 4th Anglican bishop of Qu&#x00e9;bec. He participated vigorously in the development of the Protestant public school system in Qu&#x00e9;bec and collaborated with Sir Alexander Galt in drawing up Section 93 of the British North American Act which conferred upon Parliament the responsibility of protecting the educational rights of minorities. The original hall was built in 1891 from the proceeds of a subscription raised by BCS old boys to mark the 25th anniversary of Bishop Williams' consecration. It was destroyed by fire later that year, and rebuilt in 1892.  It now serves as a lecture and presentation hall.</p>
<h3>Bandeen Hall</h3>
<p><a>thumb|Bandeen Hall</a> Bandeen Hall was built as a gymnasium for undergraduates and the boys of Bishop's College School. In 1950, the North-facing main door was replaced by the large bay window and the room became the dining-hall for the Norton-Pollack residence complex. From 1971 onward, all meals were served in Dewhurst Hall, and the room again passed into general use, serving in particular as the undergraduate Pub, until Memorial House was converted for that purpose. In 1977, temporary studios for the Fine Arts departments of Champlain College and the University were installed in the hall and adjacent kitchen and storage areas. In 1990, as a result of the success of the Learning for Life campaign, these areas were converted into classrooms, studios and offices for the University's Music department, and the hall was converted into a concert hall, which was named for the late Robert A. Bandeen, Chancellor of the University from 1981 to 1987, and his wife, Mona Blair Bandeen, generous benefactors of music at Bishop's.</p>
<h3>Old Library</h3>
<p><a>thumb|Old Library</a> Originally added to McGreer Hall in 1909 to serve as the University Library, it was converted into office space during the 1970s. In 1939 renovations to the historic McGreer Hall included the complete renovation and restoration of the library wing, which had over the years been subdivided into 2 floors and the magnificent wooden ceiling was covered by tiles. Work on the library wing was completed in time for the Sesquicentennial celebrations in 1993-1994, which culminated in a sherry reception for the Governor-General in the newly restored library wing, now known by its former name as the Old Library. The Old Library serves as the centre for the University Archives and the Archives Service of the Eastern Townships Research Centre. The special collection of books pertain to the history of the Eastern Townships, Canada, and special volumes concerning Bishop's University. Used year-round by faculty and students, the room is especially popular during the summer months when people from across Canada and the U.S. come to research their genealogy. The room is also used throughout the academic year for lectures, receptions and other special events. The room may also be used simply as a study hall, a quiet place for all students.</p>

<h3>Old Lennoxville Golf Club</h3>
<p><a>thumb|left|Old Lennoxville Golf Club</a> The Bishop's campus uniquely features a golf course and club: The Old Lennoxville Golf Club. The club was founded by Bishop's University and received a charter from the Royal Canadian Golf Association in the year 1897.  There are four golf clubs that pre-exist Lennoxville in the RCGA. They are: Royal Montreal founded in 1873; Royal Quebec founded in 1874; Murray Bay founded in 1876; and Royal Ottawa founded in 1891. In 1963, the Directors of the Lennoxville Golf Club founded and constructed the &quot;Milby&quot; course. Owned and operated by the Lennoxville Golf Club, the directors continued to operate both clubs under the umbrella of &quot;the Lennoxville Golf Club&quot; until 1975. The two different locations were being referred to as the Lennoxville Golf Club (Milby Course) and the Lennoxville Golf Club (the Old Course), thus the present name of the &quot;Old Lennoxville Golf Club&quot; was established. The course remains one of the oldest in Canada.</p>
<h3>St. Mark's Chapel</h3>
<p>St. Mark&#x2019;s Chapel was consecrated in 1857 by George Jehoshaphat Mountain. St. Mark&#x2019;s is in the Perpendicular Gothic style, prevalent in England during the Tudor period. The fa&#x00e7;ade, with its fenestration, string course and buttresses, shows the influence of the 13th century&#x2019;s formal architecture vocabulary. The ogival windows, twinned on the long side and in groups of three on the West fa&#x00e7;ade, repeat the same arrangement which can be seen in Salisbury Cathedral. The entrance door, adorned with a ogival arch, is like that of <a>Eton College</a> in Windsor or <a>Trinity College</a>, <a>Cambridge</a>. The Chapel was almost completely destroyed by fire in 1891. The Corporation decided to rebuild it on the same site, as a memorial to Principal Nicholls, and during the next six years the superb interior furniture and panelling was completed by the Sherbrooke cabinet-making firm of George Long. Much of the finer carving is thought to have been the work of his assistant, Georges B&#x00e9;langer.  Made of beautifully crafted Eastern Townships ash, the interior of the chapel is most remarkable for the exquisite quality of the wood sculptures.  Carefully maintained and beautifully preserved, St. Mark's Chapel was declared Cultural Property by the Quebec Ministere des Affaires culturelles in 1989. <a>thumb|AD 1843</a></p>

<h3>School spirit</h3>
<p>Students are known for their strong affinity towards the university especially during sports games. A popular spot for social gatherings is the nearby Golden Lion Pub. In 2005, the CBC's <a>Rick Mercer Report</a> named it the best student pub in Canada.</p>

<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left|Canada's BU</a> The Bishop's University teams are known as the Gaiters and compete in <a>Canadian Interuniversity Sport</a>. Although their logo and mascot suggest the term stems from the word <a>alligator</a>, &quot;<a>Gaiter</a>&quot; actually refers to a boot covering worn by Anglican bishops up until the beginning of the 20th century.  The Gaiters are represented by eight varsity teams (Football, Men's &amp; Women's Basketball, Men's &amp; Women's Rugby, Women's Soccer, Women's Indoor Soccer and Golf) and two club teams (Men's Lacrosse, Women's Hockey).  The Bishop's Gaiters have a long history with the university.  The early days were marked by massive participation in team sports such as cricket and football. <a>Rugby football</a> began in 1888 and <a>Canadian football</a> was a budding varsity sport by the 1930s. <a>thumb|Bishop's University football helmet</a></p>
<h4>Football</h4>
<p>It wasn't until the early 60's that Principal Ogden Glass gave the University the direction Athletics needed to provide the necessary moral and financial support that ultimately shaped the modern day success of the Gaiters football program. Principal Glass hired Bruce Coulter as Director of Athletics and Head Football Coach in 1961. This hiring would help Bishop's develop a full fledged athletic program with teams that could compete on the senior intercollegiate level. Bruce retired as head football coach with a CIAU best record of most wins with 137 (his record was 137 wins, 80 losses and 3 ties). In 1991, the football stadium was re-named in his honor and the Gaiters now play on Coulter Field. <a>thumb|left|Jamall Lee, Jeff Russel Trophy 2007</a> The Bishop's football team competes for two special trophies: The Mayor's Cup, which is awarded to the winner of the annual contest between Bishop's and the <a>Universit&#x00e9; de Sherbrooke</a>, and the Bigg Bowl, which goes to the winner between Bishop's and <a>St. Francis Xavier University</a> (currently scheduled once every three years). In 2007 Bishop&#x2019;s Gaiters running back Jamall Lee and head coach Leroy Blugh are honoured as major award winners by the Quebec University Football League. Lee was awarded the Jeff Russel Trophy, given to the league&#x2019;s most outstanding player, while Blugh was named QUFL Coach of the Year.<a>thumb|Bishop's Baseketball Team 1964</a></p>
<h4>Basketball</h4>
<p>The hard-court has also brought Bishop's great success.  The 1966-67 Men's Basketball Gaiters were the first basketball champions at Bishop's University, the Gaiters' &quot;machine&quot; rolled through the Ottawa-St. Lawrence Athletic Association with a 15-1 record before triumphing over Ottawa and MacDonald in the league playoffs.</p>
