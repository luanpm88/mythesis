<p>  <strong>Lewis &amp; Clark College</strong> is a <a>private</a>, <a>independent</a>, <a>liberal arts college</a> in <a>Portland, Oregon</a>, <a>United States</a>.  It was chartered as the <strong>Albany Collegiate Institute</strong> in 1867 in the town of <a>Albany</a>,  south of Portland by <a>Willamette Valley</a> <a>Presbyterian</a> pioneers, and relocated to Portland in 1938. With antecedents dating to 1858, Lewis &amp; Clark is one of four colleges in Oregon (along with <a>Willamette University</a>, <a>Pacific University</a>, and <a>Linfield College</a>) with foundations that predate Oregon's statehood. The College has been coeducational since the first class, which graduated in 1873.</p>
<p>In 1942 the school adopted the name Lewis &amp; Clark College after the <a>Lewis and Clark Expedition</a>. Today, the three schools of the college and their supporting offices occupy a campus of 137 acres (554,000 m&#x00b2;), centered on the M. Lloyd Frank Estate on Palatine Hill in the <a>Collins View</a> neighborhood of Southwest Portland.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left|Albany College Administration Building</a> The college was founded as the Albany Academy in <a>Albany, Oregon</a>, with incorporation in 1858. In 1866, the school name was changed to Albany Collegiate Institution, and the next year the Presbyterian church founded Albany College. In 1942 the College trustees acquired the Lloyd Frank (of the historic Portland department store <a>Meier &amp; Frank</a>) &#x201c;Fir Acres&#x201d; estate in <a>Southwest Portland</a>, and the school name was changed to Lewis &amp; Clark College.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<h3>Campus overview</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|Frank Manor House</a> Lewis &amp; Clark's  forested campus sits atop Palatine Hill in the <a>Collins View</a> neighborhood of Portland, Oregon, and is contiguous with the 645 acre (2.61 km2) <a>Tryon Creek State Natural Area</a>. Campus buildings include an award-winning environmentally sustainable academic building, as well as notable historic architecture such as the Frank Manor House and Rogers Hall (formerly Our Lady of Angels convent of The Sisters of St. Francis). Due in large part to the college's natural environment, Lewis &amp; Clark was recently named one of America's top ten &quot;Most Beautiful Campuses&quot; by the Princeton Review, as well as an independent architecture blog.</p>
<h3>Residence halls</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|Stewart Residence Hall</a> All students are required to live on campus for the first two years, unless already a Portland resident.  Residence halls include SOA (Stewart-Odell-Akin), Forest, Hartzfeld, Platt-Howard, Copeland and also include East, Roberts, and West, the on campus apartments.</p>
<p>Several of the student residence halls have themes.  Stewart is &quot;Substance Free/Wellness&quot;, providing a home for those who wish to live in a drug and alcohol-free environment.  Akin is known as the &quot;Multicultural Dorm&quot;, hosting a majority of students from outside of the United States as well as some U.S. students with international experience.  Platt-Howard: Platt West houses the Platteau student-run arts center, and the &quot;Visual and Performing Arts&quot; (or VAPA) and Howard has an &quot;Outdoor Floor&quot;. Juniper and Spruce in the Forest complex offer all-female and all-male housing respectively. Hartzfeld requires sophomore standing or higher to live in. East Hall, Roberts Hall and West Hall are a series of on-campus apartments completed in 2003 and require junior class standing or higher to live in.</p>

<h3>Sustainability</h3>
<p><a>150px|thumb|right|Roses are abundant at Lewis &amp; Clark College.</a> Sustainability is an important issue for many students, faculty, and college administrators. Currently, wind power provides 30% of the college's total electricity, and LEED 'Certified' level must be met for all of the college's projects. Reuters recently listed Lewis &amp; Clark as one of the 10 best universities in the United States for studying Cleantech.</p>
<h3>Athletics</h3>
<p>Lewis &amp; Clark maintains 9 male and 10 female varsity sports teams, and athletic facilities including Pamplin Sports Center and Griswold Stadium. Lewis &amp; Clark athletic teams are called the Pioneers, and team colors are orange and black. The Pioneers compete mainly in the Northwest Conference against eight other NCAA Division III institutions in the Pacific Northwest. One in five undergraduates are officially designated student athletes. Recent accomplishments in varsity athletics include the men's rowing team winning its conference, women's swim team winning third in conference, and men's and women's basketball both earning third in conference. A large number of smaller club and intramural sports such as <a>Ultimate Frisbee</a>, <a>Boffing</a>, and college outdoors enjoy broad participation. Lewis &amp; Clark students have invented several intramural competitive sports, including Ninja and Wolvetch, which are popular at Lewis &amp; Clark but seldom played elsewhere. While some varsity athletic events are well attended, there has long been tension between varsity athletes and non-athletes regarding perceived social and cultural differences, as well as the substantial financial support varsity sports teams enjoy.</p>
<h3>Transportation</h3>
<p>Throughout the year the college operates a shuttle bus between campus and <a>Pioneer Square</a> in downtown Portland (called the <em>Pio Express</em>, or colloquially <em>The Raz,</em> due to its operation by Raz Transportation).  During winter months they also operate a daily shuttle to <a>Mount Hood Meadows Ski Resort</a>.  <a>TriMet</a> line 39 operates between the college and the Burlingame transit center, where students can transfer to buses to downtown Portland. First year students are not permitted to have cars on campus.</p>
