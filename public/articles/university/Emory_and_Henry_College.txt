<h2>History</h2>
<p>Founded in 1836, Emory &amp; Henry College is named after <a>John Emory</a>, a <a>Methodist</a> <a>bishop</a>, and <a>Patrick Henry</a>, an American <a>Patriot</a> and <a>Virginia</a>&#x2019;s first governor. The college was founded upon the union of faith and learning and the ideals of freedom and civic virtue by Creed Fulton, a Methodist minister, Colonel William Byars, Tobias Smyth, a Methodist farmer, and Alexander Findlay, a Methodist businessman.</p>
<p>Emory &amp; Henry has been affiliated with The Holston Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church since its inception, and Emory &amp; Henry is still affiliated with the conference to this day.  The foundation for Wiley Hall was laid on 30 September 1836. The board of trustees then hired Charles Collins (1838-1852) as the institution's first president with classes beginning in the spring of 1838 with only 60 students enrolled. which is now the <a>Martha Washington Inn</a>.</p>
<p>As the oldest college in <a>Southwest Virginia</a>, Emory &amp; Henry College&#x2019;s entire campus is listed on the <a>National Register of Historic Places</a>. Graduates of E&amp;H have become scientific researchers, NASA engineers, writers, physicians, ministers, lawyers, educators and business people.</p>
<h2>Mission</h2>
<p>According to college's web-site, the official mission of the college is stated as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;'Increase in Excellence,' the historic motto of Emory &amp; Henry College, expresses the college&#x2019;s intention to be a learning community that moves toward fulfilling every student's potential. Bishop John Emory, along with the founders of Methodism, symbolizes the college&#x2019;s belief in the union of faith and learning, while Governor Patrick Henry symbolizes the college&#x2019;s commitment to freedom and civic virtue.</p>
<p>E&amp;H affirms the Christian faith as its spiritual and moral heritage and encourages all of the college&#x2019;s members to grow in faith as they grow in knowledge. E&amp;H believes in the worth of each person's religious and cultural heritage, inasmuch as that heritage leads to service to others in our region and the larger world.</p>
<p>E&amp;H affirms the liberal arts as its intellectual foundation and believes that excellence results when everyone actively participates in the educational process. The college challenges all persons to confront historical and contemporary ideas and issues and to develop the ability to think critically about all areas of human experience.</p>
<p>Such traditions provide the context for the college&#x2019;s pursuit of excellence, as it engages a diverse group of well-qualified men and women in educational experiences that lead to lives of service, productive careers, and global citizenship.&quot;</p>

<p>Forbes Magazine has consistently ranked Emory &amp; Henry among the top 100 colleges and universities in the nation. Emory &amp; Henry was one of five Virginia institutions to make the top 100 and the only regional college or university among the 569 (or the top 15 percent) selected for the ranking out of the 3,798 institutions nationwide.</p>
<p>Emory &amp; Henry is ranked as the 25th safest school in the nation.</p>
<p>It is also featured in Loren Pope's book, <em>Colleges That Change Lives</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;Emory &amp; Henry doubles the talents of most of the kids it gets, and contributes to their moral development as well. It is a caring, nurturing college, and it may be unique in the way it works with parents . . . I didn't meet anyone who wished he'd gotten into some other school, which is unusual, because at nearly every college, except maybe Harvard, there is a sullen cohort of rejected suitors of another institution.&quot; - Loren Pope, <em>Colleges That Change Lives</em>.</p>
<p>In the last 20 years, six E&amp;H professors have been named Virginia or U.S. Professor of the Year by the Carnegie Foundation and the Council for the Advancement and Support of Education&#x2014;a feat unmatched by any college or university in the state.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p><a>thumb|center|600px|View of E&amp;H's football field</a> Emory &amp; Henry College&#x2019;s sports teams, nicknamed the &#x201c;Wasps,&#x201d; participate in <a>NCAA Division III</a> in the <a>Old Dominion Athletic Conference</a> (ODAC).  The college fields teams in men&#x2019;s football, soccer, basketball, golf, baseball, cross country, and tennis and women&#x2019;s cross country, volleyball, basketball, softball, soccer, tennis, and swimming.</p>
<p>The E&amp;H Wasps are credited with inventing an American football offensive <a>formation</a>, named in the college's honor, that divides the offensive line and wide receivers into three groupings of three. While it is primarily used today as a <a>trick play</a>, it was revived in 2007 as an integral part of the <a>A-11 offense</a>, a high school football offensive scheme that was eventually banned due to the exploitation of loopholes in the high school rulebooks. The offense inspired <a>Steve Spurrier</a> to use variations of it as a trickplay formation at Florida and South Carolina named &quot;Emory &amp; Henry&quot;, as Spurrier attended Wasps games as a child growing up in nearby <a>Johnson City, TN</a>. The formation is featured on EA Sports' <a>NCAA Football 07</a> video game as well.</p>
<p>The Emory and Henry football team has a long storied history claiming 10 ODAC Conference Championships (more than any other member of the ODAC) since the league's inception in 1976,  and appearing in the Tangerine Bowl (currently called the <a>Capital One Bowl</a>) during the 1949 and 1950 seasons.  They have also managed to make it to the 1987 NCAA DIII Semifinal game under coach Lou Wacker before losing to now Division I <a>Wagner College</a>, and well as making it to the DIII tournament numerous times.  E&amp;H also boasted the nations longest winning streak in 1999 at 37 games. In 2004, Y'all magazine listed Emory &amp; Henry among the 40 colleges and universities in the South with the greatest football traditions. &quot;Not to be overshadowed by neighboring Division I powerhouses . . .Winning seasons plus pride and pageantry equals one of the greatest Southern football traditions.&quot; and have won games against other Division I programs such as <a>Tennessee</a>, <a>Appalachian State</a>, <a>Marshall</a>, <a>The University of Central Florida</a>, and <a>Middle Tennessee State</a>.  The Wasps oldest current football rival is <a>Hampden-Sydney College</a> who first played the Wasps in 1922.</p>
<p>Emory &amp; Henry College has had three players drafted to the NFL over the years.  The most notable being <a>Sonny Wade</a>(class if '69) who went on to play several years in the CFL.</p>
<p>The Emory &amp; Henry Football team is currently coached by Don Montgomery who played at <a>Mt. Union College</a> (Class of 1977), and helped the Purple Raiders win seven DIII National Championships.</p>

<h2>Mascot</h2>
<p>The official Emory &amp; Henry mascot is the Wasps.  While there are many rumored origins of the nickname, the most commonly accepted story is that Emory &amp; Henry was first called the Wasps after the football team played the first ever game in Tennessee's <a>Neyland Stadium</a> by a local Knoxville newspaper.  Though Emory &amp; Henry was beaten 27-0, legend has it that the local paper declared &quot;that those Virginia boys stung like wasps,&quot; and the nickname has stuck ever since.</p>
<p>The Emory &amp; Henry basketball team's unofficial mascot is a dog named &quot;Pete,&quot; who wears an Emory &amp; Henry jersey and is yellowish in nature.  Pete is a reference to the late Emory &amp; Henry basketball coach Bob Johnson's <a>Labrador retriever</a> (which was also named Pete).  Pete (the dog) was often seen sitting beside Coach Johnson during games at the King Center.</p>

<p>The Rock - Every athletic team that plays their games at Fred Self Stadium touches a giant rock taken from the late Fred Self's hometown.

<p>Byars Music Hall - Byars was once the home of two debate societies at the college, and it is rumored that during the meetings of one of these societies an argument between two students became so heated that one of the students was pushed out of the front second story window.
