<p> <strong>James Cook University (JCU)</strong> is a <a>public</a> <a>university</a> based in <a>Townsville, Queensland</a>, Australia and was proclaimed on 20 April 1970  in Townsville. JCU is the second oldest university in Queensland and the first <a>tertiary education</a> institution in <a>North Queensland</a>. JCU is one of only 17 Australian universities that was listed in the <a>ARWU</a> top 400 academic world universities in 2008.  The official opening of the University was conducted by <a>Queen Elizabeth II</a>.   On 1 January 1982, JCU amalgamated with The Townsville College of Advanced Education located adjacent to the main campus in Douglas. The university established a presence in <a>Cairns</a> in 1987 and moved to its current location in the suburb of Smithfield in 1996. On 1 January 1991, the School of Art and Design of the Townsville College of <a>TAFE</a> was transferred to JCU. In 2003 the University opened an international campus referred to as <a>JCUS</a> in <a>Singapore</a>. The university further expanded its presence by establishing another campus in <a>Brisbane</a>, <a>Queensland</a> in 2006.</p>
<p>A year after JCU's proclamation, <a>Cyclone Althea</a> struck the Townsville region.  This, together with the destruction caused by <a>Cyclone Tracy</a> in <a>Darwin</a> 1974, prompted the establishment of a cyclone research facility.  The $1 <a>billion</a> project is aimed at completely redeveloping the University campuses, faculties and attracting more students to JCU.  Initial stages of planning and design are currently under way and the project is estimated to be finished in 2015.  Included in the project will be major upgrading of student facilities, creation of extra on-campus residential housing, commercial site-leasing, a student village and upgrading of sports facilities.</p>
