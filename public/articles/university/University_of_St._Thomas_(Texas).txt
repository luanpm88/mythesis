<p> </p>
<p>The <strong>University of St. Thomas</strong> (also referred to as <strong>UST</strong> or <strong>St. Thomas</strong>) in <a>Houston, Texas</a>, United States is a comprehensive <a>Catholic</a> <a>university</a>, grounded in the <a>liberal arts</a>. Founded by 1947 by <a>Basilian Fathers</a>, it serves as the only Catholic university in the <a>Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|The University of St. Thomas around 2008</a> <a>thumb|Street signs around the campus</a> On June 24, 1944, the Bishop of the Diocese of Galveston-Houston, Christopher E. Byrne, entered into an agreement with the Houston based members of the <a>Congregation of St. Basil</a> to found a co-educational <a>Roman Catholic</a> university in Houston &quot;as soon as practicable after the War, if possible by 1947.&quot; The <a>Basilian Fathers</a> had previously started several other secondary schools, as well as institutions of higher learning, throughout Texas in the early 20th Century, including <a>St. Thomas High School</a>, also located in Houston. The first classes at UST began on September 22, 1947 with 57 freshmen and 8 faculty members. UST graduated its first class on May 31, 1951.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>The University of St. Thomas is located in the <a>Neartown</a> area. The campus is north of Houston's <a>Museum District</a> and is adjacent to the famous <a>Menil Collection</a> and the <a>Rothko Chapel</a>. The campus is located within five miles of <a>Uptown</a>, <a>Texas Medical Center</a>, Downtown Houston's Theater District, and the <a>Houston Zoo</a>.</p>
<p>Many of the University's departments office out of houses built in 1930s that are scattered throughout campus. Some of the buildings are historic including the <a>Link-Lee Mansion</a>, once the largest home in Houston which is currently the home of the University's executive office, and Hughes House, the childhood home of <a>Howard Hughes</a>, housing the <a>Theology</a> department.</p>
<h3>Academic Mall</h3>
<p>[[Image:Chapel.st.basil.night.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Academic Mall, with the [[Chapel of St. Basil]] on one end, at night]] The campus is arranged in a square format, with the main focus of buildings on the north side of the campus which is called the Academic Mall. Composed of rectangular buildings, the Academic Mall is the symbolic architecture of <a>Philip Johnson</a>. The use of Johnson as the University's architect spawned mild controversy due to the noted architect's open homosexuality and his flirtation with fascism and atheism which clashed with the teachings of the Catholic Church. This controversy has died down and mostly been forgotten.</p>
<p>On the south end of the Academic Mall is the Doherty Library, while the <a>Chapel of St. Basil</a> is located at the opposite end. Four structures flank these two buildings on each side in a rectangular formation surrounding a <a>courtyard</a>. The setup is designed to display the methods of human knowledge (<a>faith</a>, represented by the Chapel, and <a>reason</a>, represented by the library) in dialogue regarding the various subject matters (represented by the other buildings, most of which are specialized in one or two subjects).</p>
<h3>Chapel of St. Basil</h3>
<p><a>thumb|200px|right|Chapel of St. Basil, including a view of the labrynth</a>The <a>Chapel of St. Basil</a> is the main location of Catholic worship on campus. It is categorized by the <a>Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston</a> as a satellite chapel of St. Anne's Catholic Church.</p>
<p>The Chapel of St. Basil is a unique work of <a>art</a> that has won many awards for its architecture. Named after <a>St. Basil the Great</a>, a fourth century <a>bishop</a> who was a proponent of both <a>education</a> and the <a>monastic life</a>, the Chapel sits at the north end of the Academic Mall, representing faith in the Academic Mall's artistic depiction between balance and faith, and reason in dialogue.</p>
<p>There is no artificial light inside the main section of the building during the daytime. There is sufficient sunlight to fully light the worship space, as a combination of smooth textures and reflective surfaces maximize all light shone in the building. At night, the lights from outside combined with candles inside the Chapel are more than enough to illuminate the <a>worship</a> area.</p>
<p>A setup of the architecture also shifts the focus the building. The entry to the outdoor narthex of the Chapel is created with a tent-like flap extending over the entry, creating an enclosed space that is still outdoors. The entrances to the Chapel are faced away from the center of the building and towards the <a>tabernacle</a> as a reminder to all the enter that the central point of the Chapel is not the <a>altar</a> or the <a>crucifix</a>, but rather the location of the <a>Eucharist</a>.</p>
<p>During the 2005-2006 school year, the Gueymard Meditation Garden was built on the west side of the Chapel, featuring a <a>labyrinth</a>, three fountains (meant to represent the persons of the Trinity), and benches for reflection. The garden features a replica of the Cathedral of Chartres in labyrinth in France. Seen from above, the four arms of the pattern stand out as a clear image of the cross of Jesus Christ.</p>
<h3>Doherty Library</h3>
<p>Completed in September 1972, The Robert Pace and Ada Mary Doherty Library (located at the southern end of the Academic Mall) is one of the premier research libraries in Houston. Housing over 230,000 books, 30,000 periodicals, and 125 databases, the Doherty Library has earned an &quot;A&quot; rating from the American Library Association, the highest possible rating for a library or any other research institution.</p>

<h3>Pre-Law Program</h3>
<p>The University also maintains a pre-law program. Much like the pre-health professional programs, the pre-law program is not a major in itself, but is rather an additional program which can be combined with any major. Pre-law students enroll in required pre-law courses that help prepare for the <a>Law School Admissions Test</a> (LSAT), Socratic examination and case briefing. To support UST students in applying to law school, the University participates in a cooperative admission program with <a>South Texas College of Law</a>.</p>

<h2>Student organizations</h2>
<p>The <em>Student Organizations Committee</em> is a collective of student leaders from five major organizations that oversee many areas of student life. There is no presiding officer of the SOC. All SOC members have an administrative or faculty adviser. SOC members are allowed to petition for operating budgets before other organizations and/or clubs can request funds for the following school year.</p>
<h3>Members of the SOC</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The <em>Student Government Association</em> is the legislative student body at UST. The senate body consists of up to four representatives from each class (freshman, sophomore, junior, senior, and graduate) who are elected into office. An executive board led by an elected president and an elected vice president oversee the SGA. The SGA president can appoint a secretary, treasurer, historian, parliamentarian, and webmaster. The SGA's main function is to allocate funds collected by the Student Activity Fee. It holds regular meetings every Tuesday in the Council of Clubs meeting room in Crooker Center.</li>
  <li>The <em>Student Activities Board</em> is the main programming organization at UST. SAB is led by an elected president and an elected vice president. It is responsible for planning traditional events like Neewollah and Spring Formal, as well as occasional open mic and monthly bingo nights.</li>
  <li>The <em>Council of Clubs</em> is an umbrella organization that represents clubs on campus. It is led by an elected chair and an appointed vice chair. The COC provides funding for various clubs at UST. Interested clubs may request membership into the COC and may be approved with a simple majority vote by eligible clubs, called the board of directors.</li>
  <li>The <em>Sport Clubs Associations</em> is responsible for the sport clubs on campus. It is led by an elected president. Like the COC, it is an umbrella organization that funds athletic-oriented clubs and teams at UST.</li>
  <li>The <em>Graduate Student Association</em> is responsible for representing and catering to the graduate students of UST, which make up about 40% of the student body. In addition to helping integrate graduate students with the campus, it provides independent programming open to both graduates and undergraduates.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Non-SOC Organizations</h3>
<p>The University acknowledges 69 student organizations, most of which fall within SOC jurisdiction, but other organizations are overseen by other departments of the University. Honor Societies and Academic Clubs are often overseen by their departments, but some seek COC approval for financial purposes. Other organizations are under the directorship of administrative offices such as Campus Ministry.</p>
<p>Amongst the student organizations beyond the scope of the SOC are the <a>Knights of Columbus</a>, <a>Catholic Daughters of the Americas</a>, <a>Legion of Mary</a>, and over 20 department-run <a>honor societies</a>.</p>
<h3>Publications</h3>
<ul>
  <li><em>The Summa</em>, founded in September 2008, is the newspaper serving the UST community. <em>The Summa</em> is led by a student editor-in-chief as well as various section editors and staff members. The staff is responsible for producing the paper, which is published on the first Thursday of every month during the fall and spring semesters.</li>
  <li><em>Laurels</em> literary magazine publishes poems, short fiction, and other creative writing submitted by enrolled students. It is led by three appointed editors. During the fall, the three editors are responsible for the administration and editing of the issue. However, a curriculum-approved Literary magazine class, in cooperation with the editors, is responsible for the spring issue.</li>
  <li><em>Thoroughfare</em> magazine is the newest publication on campus. Modeled after <a>The New Yorker</a> as a &quot;features&quot; magazine, it highlights students, organizations, events, places, and local occurrences in Houston. It is led by an appointed student editor-in-chief with the help of a student staff.</li>
