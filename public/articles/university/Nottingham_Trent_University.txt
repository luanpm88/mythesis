<p> </p>
<p><strong>Nottingham Trent University</strong> (<strong>NTU</strong>) is a <a>university</a> in <a>Nottingham</a>, <a>England</a>. It was founded as <em>Trent <a>Polytechnic</a></em> (later <em>Nottingham Polytechnic</em>) in 1970 before gaining university status in 1992. Its roots can be traced to around 1945 (however some of its origins can be loosely associated with the founding of University College Nottingham, now the <a>University of Nottingham</a>). It is one of the largest universities in the <a>United Kingdom</a>, serving more than 24,000 students.</p>
<p><strong>Clifton Campus</strong> <a>thumb|alt=Mammoth Sculpture Outside Erasmus Darwin building|Mammoth Sculpture Outside Erasmus Darwin building</a> Situated at <a>Clifton</a>, around four miles from Nottingham, the Clifton Campus is home to the University's Schools of Arts and Humanities, Education, and Science and Technology. It also hosts an <a>Anthony Nolan Trust</a> <a>Cord Blood Bank</a>, and the newly operational John van Geest Cancer Research Centre, recipient of the largest research grant awarded to a <a>post-1992 university</a>. Clifton campus is linked to the city campus by a regular student bus service (as often as every 12 minutes during term), also offers halls of residence (Peverell and College Drive), numerous sports facilities, cafes, a library and a student union bar, &quot;The Point&quot;, as well as an astronomical observatory.</p>
<p><strong>Brackenhurst Campus</strong> Home to the School of Animal, Rural and Environmental Sciences, Brackenhurst is approx 14 miles from Nottingham. It is a countryside 200 hectare estate with woodland, a lake and landscaped gardens. It is home to a glasshouse, equestrian centre, Veterinary Nursing building and also has its own <a>dairy farm</a> and licensed bar. Brackenhurst has many facilities to offer to students, these include the Animal Unit, Environment Centre, Equestrian Centre, Glasshouse Complex, Farm, Veterinary Nursing Centre and laboratories. The Animal Unit is home to over 200 animals from 61 species, aiding the learning of students of animal handling and companion animal husbandry. The Farm is resident to over 200 Ewes, 250 Lambs and 8 Heifers. The Veterinary Nursing Centre was purpose built in 2007 and was made a RCVS accredited Veterinary Nursing Centre, inside is a simulation Veterinary Practice offering students hands on experience at the University. Due to the Brackenhurst campus being situated so far away from the City the students closest port of call for social events is the local town of <a>Southwell</a>.</p>
<h3>Recent developments</h3>
<p>The City Campus benefited from the completion of the <a>Nottingham Express Transit</a> (NET) light rail system in December 2003, which provides a tram stop outside the Boots Library. This allows a direct link to the Nottingham city's main railway station.</p>
<p>The University also recently joined forces with <a>Microsoft</a> to form the Microsoft Academy at Nottingham Trent University.</p>
<p>The University's in-house <a>managed learning environment</a> has recently been replaced, after University-wide use of the Virtual Learning Portal (VLP) for five years (4.85 <a>TB</a> of materials served and 6.7 million logins during the 2006/07 academic year). The in-house MLE has now been replaced by <a>Desire2Learn</a> from the 2008/09 academic year onwards with the Virtual Learning Portal being officially retired at the end of 2008.</p>
<p>In October 2004, the University underwent a rebranding, which included the amalgamation of Faculties into new Colleges, the introduction of a new logo and the dropping of the definite article from the official University name.</p>

<p>In July 2005, the University purchased the Belgrave Centre, thus releasing Nottingham Law School from its ongoing rental commitment along with the added benefit of providing rental income from the Government Office of the East Midlands, which currently has a tenancy agreement until 2010 for approximately half of the building.</p>
<p>The University has recently entered into a partnership with <a>Kaplan Inc.</a> to form the &quot;Nottingham Trent International College&quot; (NTIC) which, through foundation courses and pre-masters courses, helps international students to progress to undergraduate and postgraduate programmes at NTU and other UK universities.</p>
<p>In June 2008 <a>Sir Michael Parkinson</a> was named as the first Chancellor, responsible for a number of duties, including representing the university on special occasions and conferring degrees at graduation ceremonies (although he was absent from all the 2009 graduation ceremonies). The official installation as Chancellor of Nottingham Trent University took place in a special ceremony on Tuesday 11 November 2008, at the <a>Royal Concert Hall</a>, <a>Nottingham</a>.</p>
<p>Nottingham Trent University co-hosts <a>Gamecity</a>, a five day video game festival which takes gaming out into the streets, shops and cinemas of Nottingham. It takes place in October each year.</p>
