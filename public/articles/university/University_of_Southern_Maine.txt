<p>The <strong>University of Southern Maine</strong> (USM) is a multi-campus public urban comprehensive university and part of the <a>University of Maine System</a>.  USM's three primary campuses are located in <a>Portland</a>, <a>Gorham</a>,  and <a>Lewiston</a>.  Originally founded as two separate universities (Gorham Normal School, University of Maine at Portland), the two state universities were combined in 1970 to help streamline the public university system in Maine and eventually expanded by adding the Lewiston campus in 1988. The Portland Campus is home to the <a>Edmund Muskie</a> School of Public Service along with the Bio Sciences Research Institute and the <a>University of Maine School of Law</a>, the <a>Osher Lifelong Learning Institute</a> and the Osher Map Library.  The Gorham campus, much more residential, is home to the College of Education and the School of Music.  At Lewiston-Auburn, students experience a small, intimate campus, with a focus on interdisciplinary learning.  Each campus maintains its own &quot;atmosphere&quot;, and professionals from all campuses provide a world-class experience at this regional university. </p>
<p>As of 2008, USM had 8,133 undergraduate students and 2,320 graduate and law school students, with an average class size of 22 and a student-faculty ratio of 17:1. </p>
<p>USM is among the &#x201c;Best Northeastern Colleges,&#x201d; according to The <a>Princeton Review</a>&#x2019;s 2007 listings, and was also included in its 2007 edition of &quot;America's Best Value Colleges.&quot; The current president of USM is Dr. Selma Botman, who assumed the role on July&nbsp;1, 2008 after serving as the Chief Academic Officer for the <a>CUNY</a> system in New York. Former President Dr. Richard Pattenaude became chancellor of the <a>University of Maine System</a> on July&nbsp;1, 2007.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Evolving from <a>Gorham Academy</a> into an institution of higher education, USM originated in 1878 as Gorham Normal School, later called Gorham State Teachers College and then simply Gorham State College.  In 1970 that institution merged with the University of Maine at Portland (previously Portland Junior College) and became the University of Maine at Portland-Gorham (UMPG).  The name was changed to University of Southern Maine in 1978. The Lewiston-Auburn campus was founded in 1988. USM is a major educational engine in the overall growth and development of economic, civic, and cultural life in southern <a>Maine</a>. USM offers baccalaureate and master's degree programs as well as doctoral programs in Public Policy, and School Psychology.</p>
