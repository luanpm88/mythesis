<p><strong>Birkbeck, University of London</strong> formerly <strong>Birkbeck College</strong> and occasionally known by the abbreviation <strong>BBK</strong>, is a constituent college of the <a>University of London</a>. At the undergraduate level, it aims at working people who want to study for degrees in the evenings (<a>adult education</a>). At the postgraduate level, it offers many <a>Master's degree</a> programmes that can be studied either part-time or full-time, though nearly all teaching is in the evening. It also admits full-time (as well as part-time) students for PhDs. Its staff members have excellent research reputations in subjects such as English, History, History of Art, Philosophy, Spanish, and Crystallography. It also offers many <a>continuing education</a> courses leading to <a>certificates</a> and <a>diplomas</a>, <a>foundation degree</a>s as well as other short courses.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Originally known as the London <a>Mechanics Institute</a> 1823 and later <strong>Birkbeck Literary and Scientific Institution</strong>, the main building is between Malet Street and <a>Woburn Square</a> in <a>Bloomsbury</a>, with a number of other buildings on nearby streets.  The School of Arts, including the Department of English &amp; Humanities, is housed in <a>Virginia Woolf</a>'s former <a>Gordon Square</a> residence in Bloomsbury. Other notable residents of this house include <a>Leslie Stephen</a>, <a>Vanessa Bell</a>, <a>John Maynard Keynes</a> and <a>Lydia Lopokova</a>.</p>
<p>Many Birkbeck classes are taught at other locations across the Bloomsbury area. This is due to a combination of Birkbeck's <a>widening participation</a> strategy to make higher education accessible and also because nearly all classes on one day are taught at the same time, resulting in heavy competition for limited space.</p>
<p>In 2006 it was announced that Birkbeck will be expanding into east London, in conjunction with the <a>University of East London</a>. Initially space will be rented as well as utilising the <a>University of East London Stratford Campus</a>, but the aim is to construct a dedicated facility in <a>Stratford</a>. The project is known as <a>Birkbeck Stratford</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1823, <a>George Birkbeck</a>, an early pioneer of adult education, founded the then &quot;London <a>Mechanics Institute</a>&quot; at a meeting at the Crown and Anchor Tavern on the <a>Strand</a>. Over two thousand people attended. However the idea was not universally popular and some accused Birkbeck of &quot;scattering the seeds of evil.&quot; </p>
<p>Two years later the institute would move to the Southampton Buildings on <a>Chancery Lane</a>. In 1830, the first female students were admitted. In 1858 changes to the <a>University of London</a>'s structure resulting in an opening up of access to the examinations for its degree. The Institute became the main provider of part-time university education.</p>
<h3>The School of Continuing Education</h3>
<p>The School of Continuing Education (aka the Faculty of Lifelong Learning), which specialised in <a>extra-mural studies</a> did not become an integral part of Birkbeck until 1988 but has a long separate history. It has now been integrated into the main College.</p>
<p>In 1876 the London Society for the Extension of University Education was founded, boosting the aims of encouraging working people to undertake higher education. In 1903 it became the Department of Extra-Mural Studies of the <a>University of London</a> and it was integrated into Birkbeck in 1988. In 2009 the Faculty of Lifelong Learning was incorporated into the main College structure.</p>
<h2>Research and Teaching</h2>

<p>While part-time undergraduate teaching remains the focus and mandate of Birkbeck, the college has recently begun to focus on  progressive research in the arts and humanities.</p>
<p>The Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities was established in 2004, with the renowned but controversial Slovenian philosopher <a>Slavoj &#x017d;i&#x017e;ek</a> appointed as International Director. According to its website, the Institute aims to, among other things, &quot;engage with important public issues of our time through a series of open debates, lectures, seminars and conferences&quot; and &quot;foster and promote a climate of interdisciplinary research and collaboration among academics and researchers&quot;. The launch of the Institute wasn't without controversy, provoking an article in <em><a>The Observer</a></em> newspaper titled &quot;What have intellectuals ever done for the world?&quot;  which criticised the ostensible irrelevance and elitism of contemporary public intellectuals.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the <a>London Consortium</a> graduate school &#x2014; a collaboration between Birkbeck, the <a>Tate Galleries</a>, the <a>Institute of Contemporary Arts</a>, the <a>Architectural Association</a>, and, until 1999, the <a>British Film Institute</a> - has been running since the mid-1990s, offering masters and doctoral degrees in the interdisciplinary humanities and cultural studies, resourced and jointly taught by all the participating institutions. Its permanent and adjunct faculty include figures such as <a>Tom McCarthy</a>, <a>Colin MacCabe</a>, <a>Laura Mulvey</a>, <a>Steven Connor</a>, <a>Marina Warner</a>, <a>Juliet Mitchell</a>, <a>Stuart Hall</a>, <a>Roger Scruton</a>, <a>Salman Rushdie</a>, <a>Tilda Swinton</a> as well as &#x017d;i&#x017e;ek. Its current chair is <a>Anthony Julius</a>.</p>
<p>Science research at Birkbeck has a notable tradition.  Physicist <a>David Bohm</a> who made notable contributions to the theory of <a>Quantum mechanics</a> was professor of <a>Theoretical Physics</a> from 1961&#x2013;87 and Nobel Laureates <a>Aaron Klug</a> and <a>Derek Barton</a> both worked in the faculty of <a>crystallography</a>.  Birkbeck is part of the Institute of Structural Molecular Biology, which includes the Bloomsbury Centre for <a>Structural biology</a>, established in 1998.  This is a collaborative venture between Birkbeck College and <a>University College London</a> and is a leading academic centre for translating gene sequences and determining <a>protein structure</a> and function.  It also includes the Bloomsbury Centre for Bioinformatics, a collaborative venture also between Birkbeck College and University College London for research into <a>Bioinformatics</a>, <a>Genomics</a>, <a>Systems Biology</a>,  <a>GRID computing</a> and <a>Text mining</a>.</p>
<h2>Statistics &amp; Ratings</h2>
<h3>College</h3>
<p>Birkbeck is often not included in British Newspaper University league tables, since these are usually based on the statistics for full-time undergraduates (of which Birkbeck had none in 2005-2006 The data also shows that Birkbeck is ranked 23rd in the UK and is rated above several large Russell Group universities.</p>
<p>On the 23 of September 2010, it was announced that Birkbeck has been shortlisted for the prestigious 2010 <a>Times Higher Education</a> University of the Year award </p>
<h3>Departmental</h3>
<p><em><a>The Guardian</a></em>'s 2001 RAE subject ranking league tables put Birkbeck in the top 10 for research in the following subjects: English (1st), History (1st), History of Art (2nd), Philosophy (6th), Iberian and Latin American Languages (1st), Earth Sciences (4th), Law (9th), Economics and Econometrics (5th), and Politics and International Studies (5th).</p>
<p>Birkbeck's School of English and Humanities was rated 5* in the 2001 Research Assessment Exercise, as were the School of History, Classics and Archaeology, the School of Crystallography, and the section for Spanish and Latin American studies within the School of Languages, Linguistics and Culture&#x2014;ranking these departments with, and in some cases above, Oxford and Cambridge.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<p>As Birkbeck primarily offers part-time courses, often in the evenings, student life is less centralised than in other universities. It does not offer its own <a>halls of residence</a>, for instance, though Birkbeck students do have access to the University of London's intercollegiate halls.</p>
<p><a>Birkbeck Students' Union</a> offers a number of societies for students, as well as a football club that competes in the University of London league. It also provides student representation and support, a student magazine, a student shop and a bar. Birkbeck students also have access to the societies and clubs of the <a>University of London Union</a> (whose building adjoins Birkbeck's Bloomsbury site). Accordingly, <em><a>London Student</a></em> distributes at the Union.</p>
<p>The college arms include a <a>lamp</a> and an <a>owl</a>, symbolising the college's motto <em>In nocte consilium</em> (translated as &quot;study by night&quot;). Because of this, the student magazine was called <em><a>Lamp and Owl</a></em>. Its name was changed to Lampanelle but it ceased production in 2009 under the editorship of Zein Sufi. </p>
<p>The original name of the institution was the London Mechanics' Institute. For this reason, the annual literary magazine published by the Birkbeck MA Creative Writing programme is called <a>The Mechanics' Institute Review</a>.</p>
<p>The college has entered teams in <em><a>University Challenge</a></em> over the years, with varied results. In 1997 a team scored just 40 points - at that stage the lowest score since the series had been revived, though this has since been broken by <a>New Hall, Cambridge</a>, the <a>University of Bradford</a> and the <em>University Challenge: The Professionals</em> team of <a>Members of Parliament</a>. 1998 saw a reversal of fortunes when Birkbeck reached the final, losing to <a>Magdalen College, Oxford</a>. In 2003 Birkbeck again reached the final, facing another team of mature students from <a>Cranfield University</a>. On this occasion Birkbeck won.</p>
