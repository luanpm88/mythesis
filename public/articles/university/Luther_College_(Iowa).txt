<p><strong>Luther College</strong> is a four-year, residential liberal arts institution of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, located in <a>Decorah, Iowa</a>, <a>USA</a>.  The college offers more than 60 majors and preprofessional programs leading to the bachelor of arts degree, with the greatest number of graduates coming from biology, education, and music.</p>
<p>Eighty-nine percent of Luther's 181 full-time faculty hold an earned doctorate or terminal degree.  The college's student-faculty ratio is 12:1. A Phi Beta Kappa chapter attests the academic excellence of the college.  Nearly 40 states and more than 50 countries are represented in the 2,500-member student body.  Over 80 percent of Luther students study abroad, and the college has one of the highest <a>Peace Corps</a> and other service corps participation rates nationally.  Luther's mission statement emphasizes faith, leadership, and service to the larger world.  Its  campus is located in the bluff country of northeast Iowa along the <a>Upper Iowa River</a>.  Luther is fully accredited by the Higher Learning Commission of the <a>North Central Association of Colleges and Schools</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>[[File:2009-0528-MN-IA12-Luther-CampusHouse.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Campus House, built in 1867, is the oldest building on campus.  Originally a [[parsonage]] for Nils O. Brandt (1824-1921), pastor of the campus, it was soon purchased by the College.]]</p>
<p>The path to founding Luther College began on October 10, 1857, when the <a>Norwegian Evangelical Lutheran Church</a> created a college to supply ministers for Norwegian congregations in the <a>Upper Midwest</a>. Until the college was established, students would study at <a>Concordia Seminary</a> in <a>St. Louis, Missouri</a>. On October 14, 1859, the Rev. <a>Peter Laurentius Larsen</a> was appointed professor to the Norwegian students at Concordia by the NELC.</p>
<p>Upon the closing of the seminary in April 1861, at the start of the <a>Civil War</a>, the NELC decided to open its own college that fall in a former parsonage at Halfway Creek, <a>Wisconsin</a>, just north of <a>La Crosse, Wisconsin</a> and close to present day <a>Holmen, Wisconsin</a>. On September 1, 1861, classes officially began with an enrollment of 16. The following year classes moved to <a>Decorah, Iowa</a>, with NELC Pastor <a>Ulrik Vilhelm Koren</a> successfully arranging the college's relocation and permanent settlement.</p>
<p>It did not take long for Luther to build an exceptional music program. In 1905, Dr. Carlo A. Sperati, an 1888 graduate of Luther, became the music director of the college and developed the Luther College Concert Band, founded in 1878, on the model of the wind ensemble pioneered by <a>John Philip Sousa</a>. Under Sperati, the band undertook several tours of <a>Europe</a>, their first in 1914, earning international acclaim for their musical talent. Sperati remained on the faculty until his death in 1945.</p>
<p><a>thumb|right|200px|Luther's current Main Building is the third to stand in the same location; fire destroyed the previous two.</a> In 1932, Luther College dropped its mandatory study of the classics and fully embraced the modern concept of the liberal arts education. The 1930s marked another milestone in the college's history with its decision to admit women to the student body, which happened in 1936 due to financial constraints associated with the Great Depression. During the 1960s Luther again experienced significant change with the construction of several new campus buildings and the adoption of a 4-1-4 semester schedule.</p>
<p>In 1964, Luther's museum collection became separate from the college and was established as the Norwegian-American Museum. Now known as <a>Vesterheim Norwegian-American Museum</a>, it is the largest and most comprehensive museum in the United States devoted to a single immigrant group. Started in 1967, <a>Nordic Fest</a> grew from Luther College Women&#x2019;s Club annual celebration of <a>Norwegian Constitution Day</a>.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left|Luther College campus</a> Luther's campus is built on the rolling wooded hills and rugged limestone cliffs of northeast Iowa's bluff country.  The scenic Upper Iowa River flows through the lower portion of the  central campus.  The college owns an additional  adjoining the central campus which are devoted to environmental research, biological studies, and recreation. </p>
<p>During the last decade the college has engaged in extensive building and renovation projects. An extensive renovation of residence halls and the Dahl Centennial Union was completed in 2006, and Sampson Hoffland Laboratories, an extension of Valders Hall of Science, was completed in 2008. Sampson Hoffland Laboratories features many &quot;green&quot; properties, including an efficient air-handling system, low-flow water devices, occupancy sensors and low VOC. Sampson Hoffland's &quot;green&quot; traits were honored with LEED Gold certification. Luther hosts a variety of housing options, including residence halls, houses, apartments, and community-style townhouses for upper-class students. The <a>Center for Faith and Life</a> is Luther's largest and primary performing arts facility, seating 1,600 people, and housing the 53-rank, 42-stop, 3-manual tracker-action Rost Memorial Pipe Organ.</p>
<h3>Sustainability</h3>
<p>Luther&#x2019;s sustainability program employs two full-time staff members. The college committed to reducing its <a>greenhouse gas emissions</a> to 50 percent below 2003-2004 levels by 2013, and has achieved a 15.5 percent reduction by 2009. Luther's dining facilities operate preconsumer compost programs and one-third operate postconsumer programs. Luther's fleet includes eight hybrid, six electric, and one compressed natural gas vehicle. All new campus construction will be built to <a>LEED</a> Silver standards. The newly-constructed Sampson Hoffland Laboratories achieved LEED Gold certification in 2009, and two additional buildings meet LEED certification standards. </p>
<p>Luther was one of only 26 schools to be awarded the highest grade of &#x201c;A-&#x201c; on the College Sustainability Report Card 2010, published by the Sustainable Endowments Institute.</p>
<h2>Campus life</h2>
<p>Ninety percent of Luther students live on campus all four years. About 85 percent are present on campus on any given weekend.  Events include approximately 162 concerts and recitals, 41 theatrical productions, 47 lectures and 143 other events.</p>
<p>Students can choose from more than 130 different groups and activities at Luther, including a student-run radio station and newspaper, more than 15 music ensembles, seven Greek societies, many academic clubs, numerous service organizations, 19 varsity sports, many recreational and club sports, Student Activities Council, and many theatrical productions.</p>
<p>Also, with the Upper Iowa River running adjacent to campus, students are offered many recreational options including canoeing, tubing, and kayaking.  Extensive biking trails and parks in Decorah are also available to students, as well as a campus disc golf course and sand volleyball courts.  Students also enjoy local shops, museums, and restaurants in Decorah, which ranks among the top 120 Best Small Towns in America.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|200px|The 64,000-square-foot Sampson Hoffland Laboratories expanded Valders Hall of Science.</a> Luther is an exclusively undergraduate institution enrolling about 2,500 students and employing 181 full-time teaching faculty.  The college is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission of the <a>North Central Association of Colleges and Schools</a> as well as professional accreditation boards for teachers, social work, music, nursing, athletic training and chemistry.  It is a member institution of the <a>Associated Colleges of the Midwest</a> and the <a>Annapolis Group</a>.</p>
<p>[[File:Koren.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Koren building, one of the oldest on campus, houses Luther's [[social sciences]] departments.]] Among liberal arts colleges, Luther was ranked 88th for 2008-2009 by <em><a>U.S. News and World Report</a></em>,  52nd in 2008 by the <em><a>Washington Monthly</a></em>, and 87th in 2008 by the Center for College Affordability &amp; Productivity. Luther was listed among the 170 &quot;Best in the Midwest&quot; colleges by the <em><a>Princeton Review</a></em> and named by the <a>Teagle Foundation</a> one of the top 13 liberal arts college based upon its strong utilization of resources, high graduation rate, and large number of alumni that pursue advanced degrees.</p>
<p>1,636 students were admitted out of 2,054 applicants (82.6 percent admissions rate) for the class of 2012. Thirty-nine percent of freshmen were in the top 10 percent of their high school class, the average high school <a>grade point average</a> was 3.6, and the <a>interquartile range</a> for <a>SAT</a> scores was 1530-1910. Tuition for 2009-2010 was $32,140, with 98 percent of students receiving need- and/or merit-based financial aid.&lt;ref name=&quot;Quick Facts&quot;/&gt;</p>
<h2>Music</h2>
<p>Luther has a number of music organizations which have acquired international recognition through their annual concert tours and recordings. The Nordic Choir, Concert Band, Symphony Orchestra and Jazz Orchestra are the college's four internationally touring ensembles, which have performed in many of the major concert halls and music centers of <a>Europe</a>, including <a>Scandinavia</a>, <a>Russia</a>, <a>China</a>, <a>Japan</a>, <a>Mexico</a>, <a>Brazil</a>, and the <a>Caribbean</a>. About 40 percent of the student body participates in at least one of the college's seven choirs, three concert bands, three string orchestras, and two jazz ensembles. &quot;Christmas at Luther,&quot; Luther's annual <a>Christmas</a> concert, is broadcast nationwide each year. The sound-only concert broadcast is updated annually, with the professionally-produced televised version updated every four years.</p>
<p>Much of Luther's musical heritage can be largely attributed to the influence of two long-serving individuals. The 40-year tenure of Dr. Carlo A. Sperati, Class of 1888, fostered the college's Lutheran musical tradition beginning in 1905, resulting in the development of the Luther College Concert Band into one of the nation's finest touring music ensembles. History shows that the Sperati's Concert Band quickly achieved national acclaim, even to the point that famed bandmaster <a>John Philip Sousa</a> canceled a performance of his famed touring ensemble just so that he could attend a performance of the Luther College Concert Band, which was scheduled to appear in a nearby city.</p>
<p>Sperati's foundation would later be strengthened and built upon by <a>Weston Noble</a> '43, himself a student of Sperati. Following three years of <a>U.S. Army</a> enlistment in <a>World War II</a>, Noble returned to his alma mater to conduct the Concert Band and the <a>Nordic Choir</a>, direct Christmastime performances of George Frederic Handel's <em>Messiah</em>, and teach in the Music Department. Noble's bands (which he conducted until 1973) and choirs completed coast-to-coast tours and international appearances. Ensembles under his direction performed solo concerts at such venues as <a>Lincoln Center</a> and Town Hall in <a>New York</a>; the <a>Kennedy Center</a> in <a>Washington, DC</a>; the <a>Mormon Tabernacle</a> in <a>Salt Lake City</a>; <a>Dorothy Chandler Pavilion</a> and the <a>Walt Disney Concert Hall</a> in <a>Los Angeles</a>; Orchestra Hall at <a>Symphony Center</a> in <a>Chicago</a>; Orchestra Hall and the State Theatre in <a>Minneapolis</a>; and the Ordway Center for the Performing Arts in <a>Saint Paul</a>. Under Noble's direction, Luther ensembles also appeared at historic cathedrals and concert halls throughout Europe, Russia, and Scandinavia, as well as on the programs of many national conventions of the <a>American Bandmasters Association</a>, the <a>American Choral Directors Association</a>, and the Music Educators National Conference.</p>
<p>The <a>Nordic Choir</a> was featured in the film &quot;The Joy of Bach,&quot; and in four weekly international broadcasts of &quot;The Hour of Power&quot; from the Crystal Cathedral in <a>Garden Grove, California</a>. <a>Weston Noble</a> retired from the faculty at the close of the academic year in 2005, having served continuously for 57 years, from 1948 to 2005.</p>
<p>The Nordic Choir, which tours internationally, is the most well known choral ensemble beyond the Luther College community.  However, the ensemble is only one of the seven choral ensembles at Luther. Collegiate Chorale is a mixed choir composed of juniors and seniors. Cathedral Choir is a mixed choir that draws exclusively from the sophomore class. Aurora (formerly known as Pike Kor, which is Norwegian for &quot;young women's choir&quot;) and Norsemen are gendered choirs composed entirely of first-year students. Cantorei is a women's choir drawing membership from all classes, primarily sophomore through senior. Collegium Musicum is an Early Music ensemble specializing in the music of the <a>Medieval</a>, <a>Renaissance</a>, and <a>Baroque</a> periods. The ensemble is open to singers of all years at Luther. In addition to the seven choirs, the Vocal Jazz Ensemble is open to first through fourth year students and often performs jointly with Luther's instrumental jazz ensembles.</p>
<p>Symphony Orchestra, Jazz Orchestra, and Concert Band also tour internationally. Symphony Orchestra establishes residency in <a>Vienna</a> every four years, and Jazz Orchestra has toured in the Caribbean and Brazil. Concert Band travels to Japan and China following spring semester every four years. Other instrumental ensembles include Chamber Orchestra, Philharmonia, Jazz Band, Varsity Band, Brass Ensemble, and Wind &amp; Percussion Ensemble.</p>
<p>Currently, <a>Frederick Nyline</a> continues to conduct the Concert Band, and <a>Dr. Allen Hightower</a> has succeeded Dr. Craig Arnold (who succeeded Weston Noble) as Director of Choral Activities and conductor of Nordic Choir. <a>Dr. Daniel Baldwin</a> conducts the Luther College Symphony Orchestra, and <a>Dr. Juan-Tony Guzm&#x00e1;n</a> directs Jazz Orchestra.</p>
<p>Luther students also participate in faculty-coached student chamber ensembles ranging from piano trios to a full flute choir.  Other prominent ensembles include the Luther Ringers student handbell choir; the 40+ member Trombone Choir; five student-led, small-group a cappella ensembles; the Luther College Balalaika ensemble; and the student-led Luther Gospel Choir.</p>
<p>Many members of the music faculty are professional performers in their own right, including Luther ensemble-in-residence, the <a>Murasaki Duo</a>, a professional cello-piano chamber ensemble.    </p>
<p>In 1996, musician <a>Dave Matthews</a> appeared in concert with <a>Tim Reynolds</a> at Luther College in the Center for Faith and Life, the site of their 1999 album <em>Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds <a>Live at Luther College</a></em>.</p>
<p>In 2002, the <a>Empire Brass</a>, with college organist William Kuhlman, appeared in concert and recorded an album,  <em>Baroque Music for Brass and Organ</em>, in the Center for Faith and Life.</p>
<p>In 2008, musician <a>Ben Folds</a> appeared for his second time in concert at Luther College in the Center for Faith and Life. During the concert, crowd tracks were recorded to be incorporated into his most recently released album.</p>
<h2>Study abroad</h2>
<p>Over 80 percent of Luther students study abroad or away. Moreover, Luther encourages faculty development through study abroad program and course development. Since 1990, over 140 Luther faculty have led Luther students on an overseas program. These experiences have resulted in the insertion of many international topics into academic disciplines and syllabuses across the curriculum. Luther faculty are strong advocates for student study abroad experiences and serve as valuable advisors to students.</p>
<p>The diverse international experiences of faculty enables development of study abroad courses and programs directly with overseas friends and colleagues, who become key resource people in other nations. These valuable contacts move students closer to the culture, improve the academic quality of courses, decrease student program costs and reduce the touring mentality. Since 1990 Luther has operated its own courses and programs in 70 nations.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p>The Luther Norse have been a member of the <a>Iowa Intercollegiate Athletic Conference</a> (commonly called the Iowa Conference or IIAC) since its founding in 1922. Luther competes in 10 men's and nine women's intercollegiate athletic programs.  Since joining the Iowa Conference, Luther has won 201 of the 482 IIAC titles during that period. </p>
<p>Two hundred seventy All-American honors have been earned by Luther student-athletes, and twenty-seven athletes have been crowned national champions. Forty-five student-athletes have been awarded the CoSIDA Academic All-American honor, and thirty have received the distinguished <a>NCAA</a> Postgraduate Scholarship. </p>
<p>Since 1993-94, the first year of this award, 1,063 academic all-conference honors have been earned by Luther student-athletes. To earn academic all-conference honors, a student-athlete must have a grade point average of 3.50 or greater on a 4.0 scale, have attended the school for a full year and competed in a varsity sport.</p>
<p>Luther's football and track teams compete in Carlson Stadium, which <em><a>USA Today</a></em> magazine referred to as &quot;one of the four best places to spend a football weekend.&quot; </p>
<p>About 20 percent of Luther's student body participates in one of the 19 varsity sports offered, and 70 percent of the student body participates in club sports. The college offers an extensive intramural sports program which ranges from slow pitch softball to Wii bowling.  Backyard Wilderness Pursuits, a student-led organization, leads outdoor activities such as skiing and rock climbing in Decorah and the surrounding area.  The school also fields dance and cheer leading squads.</p>
