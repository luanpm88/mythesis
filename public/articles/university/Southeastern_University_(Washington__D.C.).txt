<p> Located in southwestern <a>Washington, D.C.</a>, in the <a>United States</a>, <strong>Southeastern University</strong> was a <a>private</a>, non-profit undergraduate and graduate institution of higher education that lost its accreditation from the Middle States Commission on Higher Education on August 31, 2009. The Commission reported that the college lacked rigor and was losing faculty, enrollment and financial stability. The 130-year-old school ceased offering classes after an extended summer session in 2009. </p>
<p>Southeastern University was established by the <a>YMCA</a> and chartered by an <a>Act of Congress</a> in 1879. It had degree programs in <a>Criminal Justice</a>, <a>Child Development</a>, <a>Public Administration</a>, <a>Business Management</a>, <a>Accounting</a>, <a>Finance</a>, <a>Liberal Studies</a>, <a>Computer Science</a>, and Allied Health, a program initiated in 2006 at Greater Southeast Community Hospital.  There were also certificate programs in entrepreneurship, property management, real estate, Web development, and others.  It was a member of the <a>Consortium of Universities of the Washington Metropolitan Area</a> but lost this affiliation after the fall 2009 semester.</p>
<p>Through the spring of 2009, Southeastern University had a total enrollment of about 870 students, with 222 of those students pursuing postgraduate degrees.  About 77% were locally based, and a majority were female, but there was also a significant international enrollment. International enrollment had been in decline after the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, when the student population shifted from international students to primarily low-income District residents.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p> Southeastern began as a series of classes offered by the <a>YMCA</a> of the District of Columbia in 1879. The Washington School of accountancy was added in 1907, and in 1923 the university <a>incorporated</a> under the authority of the District of Columbia as, &quot;Southeastern University of the Young Men's Christian Association of the District of Columbia.&quot; An August 19, 1937 federal charter from <a>Congress</a> renamed the institution to &quot;Southeastern University&quot;. The university since gained other colleges.</p>
<p><a>Elaine Ryan</a> replaced <a>Charlene Drew Jarvis</a> as university president on March 31, 2009 after 13 years of service to the school. Prior to losing accreditation, the university was negotiating a merger with the <a>GS Graduate School</a>, also based in Washington, DC. This merger was completed in March 2010. The GS Graduate School has assumed responsibility for Southeastern's student records and issues transcripts upon request.</p>
