<h2>History</h2>
<p>Gannon University was established in 1925 as the two-year Cathedral College by the <a>Roman Catholic Diocese of Erie</a>. In 1944, the school became the four-year men's school Gannon College of Arts and Sciences, named in honor of the then-Bishop of Erie, <a>John Mark Gannon</a>, the driving force behind its opening and development. The college became coeducational in 1964 and gained university status in 1979</p>
<p>The all-girls school Villa Maria College, which was founded by the <a>Sisters of St. Joseph</a> in 1925, merged with the university in 1989. Its <em>Villa Maria School of Nursing</em> retains the name of the original institution.</p>
