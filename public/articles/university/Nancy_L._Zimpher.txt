<p> <strong>Nancy L. Zimpher</strong> (born 29 October 1946) is an American educator, state university leader, and <a>Chancellor</a> of the <a>State University of New York</a> (SUNY). Prior to her service at SUNY, Zimpher was a dean and professor of <a>education</a> at <a>Ohio State University</a> (where she had earned her <a>bachelors</a>, <a>masters</a> and <a>doctoral degrees</a>); then Chancellor of the <a>University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Milwaukee</a> between 1998 and 2003; and <a>President</a> of the <a>University of Cincinnati</a> from 2003 through May, 2009.  Zimpher is the first woman to serve as Chancellor of SUNY, was UWM's first woman chancellor, and was UC's first female president. Zimpher is a native of the village of <a>Gallipolis</a> in southern <a>Ohio</a>.</p>
<h2>University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Milwaukee</h2>
<p>At UWM (where she was the first female Chancellor of that university), Zimpher created the &quot;Milwaukee Idea&quot;, a deliberately-derivative variation on the historical <a>Wisconsin Idea</a> that &quot;the University's boundaries are the State's boundaries&quot;, with a strategic plan that tied UWM, with its faculty knowledge base and research facilities, to the economic health and strength of <a>the Greater Milwaukee area</a>, and raised the profile of UWM in the region <em>vis-a-vis</em> crosstown rival <a>Marquette University</a>.</p>
<h2>University of Cincinnati</h2>
<p>At UC, she worked to eliminate the previous divisions among the colleges (such as by creating a single university <a>commencement</a>) and continuously championed <em>UC|21</em>, an academic plan which redefined UC as a &quot;new <a>urban</a> <a>research university</a>&quot; for the 21st century; but her work was complicated by controversy over her ouster of longtime basketball coach <a>Bob Huggins</a>.  Shortly after her arrival at UC, Huggins had been arrested for (driving under the influence).  This arrest, combined with the poor performance of Huggins' players in the classroom, were among many factors that led Zimpher to force Huggins to resign in 2005. The subsequent vandalism of this Wikipedia article was itself the subject of press coverage in the <em><a>Cleveland Plain Dealer</a></em> and elsewhere.</p>
<h2>SUNY</h2>
<p>Soon after taking over at SUNY, Zimpher promised to visit all 64 campuses in the sprawling system&#x2014;the largest university system in the nation under a single governing board.</p>
<p>Only eight months after being sworn in, Zimpher had to deal with another athletic controversy, this time at <a>Binghamton University</a>.  After <a>a rash of incidents</a> involving the school's basketball team, Zimpher ordered an audit of Binghamton's athletic department&#x2014;to be overseen by the SUNY board of trustees, not Binghamton. The resulting report tallied what the <em><a>New York Times</a></em> described as &quot;a litany of transgressions, including lowered admission standards and changed grades.&quot;   In its wake, Binghamton president <a>Lois B. DeFleur</a> retired in July, athletic director Joel Thirer resigned and basketball coach <a>Kevin Broadus</a>, was placed on paid <a>administrative leave</a> and ultimately stripped of coaching duties. Zimpher eventually assigned SUNY&#x2019;s interim provost, David K. Lavallee, to lead an overall effort for the SUNY system to ensure that academics remain the highest priority; and Charles R. Westgate, a professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Binghamton, as a special adviser for academics and athletics for the SUNY system: moves some critics of the over-emphasis on athletics decried as insufficient.</p>
