<p> The <strong>University of Arkansas</strong>, often shortened to <strong>U of A</strong>, <strong>UARK</strong>, or just <strong>UA</strong>, is a public, <a>co-educational</a>, <a>land-grant</a>, <a>space-grant</a>, research university. It is categorized by the <a>Carnegie Foundation</a> as a high-activity Research University. It is the <a>flagship</a> campus of the <a>University of Arkansas System</a> and is located in <a>Fayetteville, Arkansas</a>. Founded as <strong>Arkansas Industrial University</strong> in 1871, its present name was adopted in 1899 and classes were first held in February 1872. It is noted for its strong <a>architecture</a>, <a>agriculture</a> (particularly animal science and poultry science), creative writing, history, Middle Eastern Studies and <a>business</a> programs.</p>
<p>The University of Arkansas recently completed its &quot;Campaign for the 21st Century,&quot; in which the university raised more than $1 billion for the school, used in part to create a new <a>Honors College</a> and significantly increase the university's endowment. Among these gifts were the largest donation given to a business school at the time ($50 million), and the largest gift given to a public university in America ($300 million), both given by the Walton Family Charitable Support Foundation.</p>
<p>Total enrollment for the fall semester of 2010 was 21,406, which represents the first time the University of Arkansas has enrolled more than 20,000 students, and their largest increase in enrollment since 1946. The University campus comprises more than 130 buildings on , including <a>The Inn at Carnall Hall</a>, which serves as an on-campus hotel and restaurant facility. Academic programs are in excess of 200. The ratio of students to faculty is 17:1. Tuition did not rise for the 2009&#x2013;10 academic year at the University of Arkansas, thanks in part to a $1 million donation from the Athletics Department. The average tuition nationally rose 6.6%. On April 16, 2010, the University of Arkansas Board of Trustees announced system-wide tuition increases of 3%-6.9% to combat decreases in state funding and increased enrollments. The University of Arkansas flagship campus will experience a 4.8% increase in tuition and fees for the 2010-11 academic year.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p></p>
<p>[[File:OldMainUofA.jpg|left|thumb|295px|[[Old Main (University of Arkansas)|Old Main]] on the University of Arkansas campus.]] The University of Arkansas at Fayetteville was founded in 1871 on the site of a hilltop farm that overlooked the <a>Ozark Mountains</a>, giving it the nickname &quot;The Hill&quot;.</p>
<p>The University was established under the <a>Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act</a> of 1862. The University's founding also satisfied the provision in the <a>Arkansas Constitution</a> of 1868 that the General Assembly was to &quot;establish and maintain a State University.&quot;</p>
<p>Initially, to found the University, $130,000 was raised by the citizens of <a>Washington County</a>. A second legend is that the contractor accidentally swapped the tower drawings after having had too much to drink. Although the southern tower was designed with clock faces, it never held a working clock until 2006. The bell tower has always had some type of chime, initially a bell that was rung on the hour by student volunteers. Electronic chimes were installed in 1959. In addition to the regular chimes of the clock, the university's Alma Mater plays at 5 p.m. every day. Academic programs are organized into numerous departments and schools based out of the ten primary colleges on the main campus. The university and several of its programs have been recognized on the national level. In recent years, the University of Arkansas has been recognized as a &quot;Top-Tier National University&quot;, one of the &quot;Best 371 Colleges&quot;, a &quot;Best Southeastern College&quot;, and one of the &quot;50 Best Public College Values&quot;. In addition to the University's recognitions, several colleges have received special distinctions. The <a>Sam M. Walton College of Business</a> is ranked as the 24th top public business school in the nation, and is ranked 42nd amongst all public and private schools. It has also been recognized for its 6th ranked public Marketing program, 6th ranked public Corporate Strategy program, 15th ranked public Supply Chain Management program, and 25th ranked public Masters in Business Administration program. The <a>Fay Jones School of Architecture</a> has been ranked as the 20th top undergraduate architecture program, and  ranked with &quot;notable distinction&quot; into the list of America's World Class Schools of Architecture. The <a>University of Arkansas School of Law</a> has been ranked as a top 100 &quot;Best Law School&quot;. The Creative Writing program in the <a>J. William Fulbright College of Arts and Sciences</a> has been ranked as the 5th best program in the nation. Other colleges with notable or nationally ranked programs include the <a>Dale Bumpers College of Agricultural, Food and Life Sciences</a> and the <a>College of Engineering</a>.</p>

<h2>Campus</h2>
<p> The University of Arkansas campus sweeps across hilltops on the western side of Fayetteville, Arkansas. Among the 130 buildings on the campus, 11 buildings have been added to the National Register of Historic Buildings.</p>
<p>The Fine Arts Complex was designed by <a>Fayetteville</a> native <a>Edward Durell Stone</a>, who also designed <a>Radio City Music Hall</a> and the <a>Museum of Modern Art</a> in <a>New York City</a> and the <a>John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts</a> in Washington, D.C. The buildings are indicative of Stone's idiosyncratic modern style which included patterns of ornament. The recently demolished campus apartment complex Carlson Terrace was also designed by Stone.</p>
<h2>Sports</h2>
<p>[[Image:Arkansas Razorbacks logo.png|thumb|200px|right|The [[Razorback]] is the mascot of the University of Arkansas]]  The mascot for the University of Arkansas is the <strong>Razorback,</strong> a type of wild boar, and Arkansas teams are often referred to as the <strong>Hogs</strong> (shortened version of Razorbacks). The school competes in the <a>Southeastern Conference</a> (SEC) in <a>Division I</a> of the <a>NCAA</a>. No school in the SEC has won more total national championships than Arkansas; and only 4 schools nationwide (<a>UCLA</a>, <a>Southern California</a>, <a>Stanford</a>, and <a>Oklahoma State</a>) have won more national titles than the Razorbacks.</p>
<p>From 1971 through 2007, Arkansas had completely separate men's and women's athletic departments. On January 1, 2008, the two departments merged, leaving fellow SEC school <a>Tennessee</a> as the only remaining NCAA Division I school with separate men's and women's athletic programs.</p>
<h3>Football</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The team plays its home games either at <a>Donald W. Reynolds Razorback Stadium</a>, located on the University of Arkansas campus, or at <a>War Memorial Stadium</a>, located in <a>Little Rock</a>. The football program won nine SWC titles, three SEC Western Division titles, and won a national title in 1964. During a stretch between December 1963 and January 1966, the Razorbacks won 22 straight football games. On December 11, 2007, former Louisville and Atlanta Falcons head coach, Bobby Petrino accepted an offer to become the Razorbacks head coach for the 2008 season.</p>
<h3>Men's basketball</h3>
<p><a>250px|right|thumb|The 2009-10 Razorbacks in action against LSU</a>  The men's <a>basketball</a> team head coach is <a>John Pelphrey</a> (previously at <a>South Alabama</a>). He replaced <a>Stan Heath</a> who was fired on March 26, 2007. The Razorbacks play their home games in <a>Bud Walton Arena</a> on the University of Arkansas campus. The team won the 1994 <a>National Championship</a> under coach <a>Nolan Richardson</a>, who was later dismissed by the University following a steady decline in the program and a 14-15 season. Richardson claimed publicly and in court proceedings to have been the subject of racial discrimination. A federal judge <a>in Little Rock</a>, as well as the <a>US Court of Appeals</a> in St. Louis, sided with the U of A.</p>
<p>The school has been to six Final Fours (1941, 1945, 1978, 1990, 1994, 1995) and was named as the eighth-best program in history by <em><a>Street and Smith</a>'s</em> magazine.</p>
<h3>Baseball</h3>
<p> [[File:Ryan cisterna home run.jpg|thumb|right|250 px|[[Arkansas Razorbacks baseball|Razorback]] <a>catcher</a> Ryan Cisterna hits a <a>home run</a> against <a>Nebraska</a>.]] The <a>baseball</a> team, under <a>Dave van Horn</a>, reached the <a>2004</a> and <a>2009</a> <a>College World Series</a>. They have made six trips to the College World Series (1979, 1985, 1987, 1989, 2004, 2009), going as far as the championship game. The stadium has recently undergone expansion, including 20 new skyboxes (34 in all) and seats behind the bullpen in left field. On April 7, 2009, a stadium record 11,044 fans saw <a>a 7-3 Razorbacks victory</a> over the #1 <a>Arizona State Sun Devils</a>. A weekend series with LSU in 2007 drew 29,931, which is the SEC all-time attendance record for a three-game series.</p>
<h3>Track and field</h3>
<p>The most successful program in NCAA history, the Arkansas men's <a>track and field</a> teams, led by head coach <a>John McDonnell</a> are the most decorated teams in the athletics department. The program has won 42 national titles in Cross Country and Track &amp; Field. One of its most famous stars is recent graduate <a>Alistair Cragg</a> who competed for Ireland at the <a>2004 Summer Olympics</a> in <a>Greece</a>. Other Olympians have included <a>Michael Conley</a>, <a>Daniel Lincoln</a>, <a>Graham Hood</a>, and <a>Matt Hemingway</a>. The team has a home indoor track at the <a>Randal Tyson Track Center</a> and outdoor field at <a>John McDonnell Field</a>, which hosted the 2009 NCAA Outdoor Track Championships. The new Head Coach Chris Bucknam, assistant coaches Doug Case and Travis Geophert have now moved the Men's Track and Field team to a new stand.  They recently won the 2010 SEC Indoor Track Championships.</p>
<h3>Woman's Athletics</h3>
<p>The women teams at the University of Arkansas are also referred to as Razorbacks. There are 11 varsity women sports: basketball, cross country, indoor and outdoor <a>track</a>, <a>golf</a>, <a>gymnastics</a>, <a>soccer</a>, <a>softball</a>, <a>swimming</a> &amp; <a>diving</a>, <a>tennis</a>, and <a>volleyball</a>. Among the most successful women teams are volleyball, with 11 SEC Western Division titles; cross country with more SEC championships than any member institution; basketball with 17 postseason appearances in 30 years, including the 1998 NCAA Final Four; track and field with six SEC titles and the first back-to-back women's SEC triple crowns; and gymnastics nationally-ranked since the start of the program in 2002 with two (soon three) NCAA appearances. Sprinter <a>Veronica Campbell</a> was the first Razorback woman to win a gold medal in the Olympics, with marathoner <a>Deena Kastor</a> bringing home a bronze medal in 2004.</p>
<h2>Traditions</h2>
<h3>Senior Walk</h3>
<p><a>thumb|left|250px|A sample of class of 2001 graduates.</a> The names of University of Arkansas students, starting with the first senior class of 1876, are carved into one of the concrete walkways or sidewalks on campus. This tradition was started by the 1905 graduating class of students, who drew their names into the walkway in front of <a>Old Main</a>, the oldest building on campus. Following classes added their names for more than a decade and then the university took over responsibility for adding new classes, as well as adding the names of students who graduated prior to 1905. Through most of the 20th century, the names were impressed in wet cement using brass letters. As the campus grew, and the graduating classes got bigger, the operation became unduly time-consuming. In 1986, the university's physical plant developed a special machine called the &quot;Senior Sand Hog&quot; to engrave the thousands of names required each year. School superstition states that it is bad luck to step on the Class of 1900; additionally it is said that if one steps on the name of the first graduating class, you will never graduate from the University of Arkansas.</p>
<h3>&quot;Calling the Hogs&quot;</h3>
<p> Fans of the University of Arkansas have been &quot;Calling the Hogs&quot; since the 1920s. This tradition, which refers to the school's most popular cheer at sporting events, is said to have begun when a group of farmers attending a game began issuing hog calls to encourage a lagging <a>Razorback football</a> team. The encouragement worked and the attending crowd took notice of the farmers' calling. By the next game, a group of men had organized to cry &quot;Wooo, Pig, Sooie&quot;. The call has since become the school's best-known cheer.</p>
<h3>Alma mater</h3>
<p>The current version of the University of Arkansas <em>Alma Mater</em> was written in 1909 by <a>Brodie Payne</a>, an alumnus of the University of Arkansas. He submitted his song to an ongoing competition that was trying to find a song for the university and won first prize. <a>Henry D. Tovey</a>, who was the director of the Glee Club at that time, set the song to music. In 1931, the University College Song Association in <a>New York</a> reviewed a collection of 500 college tunes, and the University of Arkansas Alma Mater was judged to be one of the twenty-five best college songs of the United States.</p>
<p>It is a student custom to point towards Old Main at the end of the verse when the words &quot;we sing unto you&quot; are sung.</p>
<p><strong>Alma Mater</strong>&lt;br&gt; Pure as the dawn on the brow of thy beauty&lt;br&gt; Watches thy soul from the mountains of God&lt;br&gt; Over the Fates of thy children departed&lt;br&gt; Far from the land where their footsteps have trod.&lt;br&gt; Beacon of hope in the ways dreary lighted;&lt;br&gt; Pride of our hearts that are loyal and true;&lt;br&gt; From those who adore unto one who adores us&#x2014;&lt;br&gt; Mother of Mothers, we sing unto you.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; We, with our faces turned high to the Eastward,&lt;br&gt; Proud of our place in the vanguard of Truth,&lt;br&gt; Will sing unto thee a new song of thanksgiving&#x2014;&lt;br&gt; Honor to God and the Springtime of Youth.&lt;br&gt; Shout of the victor or tear of the vanquished;&lt;br&gt; Sunshine or tempest thy heart is e'er true;&lt;br&gt; Pride of the Hills and the white-laden Lowlands&#x2014;&lt;br&gt; Mother of Mothers, we kneel unto you.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Ever the Legions of Sin will assail us,&lt;br&gt; Ever the Battle in Cities afar;&lt;br&gt; Still in the depths will thy Spirit eternal&lt;br&gt; Beckon us on like a piloting Star.&lt;br&gt; Down in dim years do thy dead children call thee,&lt;br&gt; Wafted to Sleep while the Springtime was new;&lt;br&gt; We, of the Present, thy hope of the Future&#x2014;&lt;br&gt; Mother of Mothers, we pray unto you.&lt;br&gt; </p>
<h3>Fight song</h3>
<p>The current version of the University of Arkansas Fight Song was written in the late 1920s. The fight song is usually played at all home Razorback sporting events.</p>
<p><strong>Arkansas Fight Song Lyrics</strong>&lt;br&gt; Hit that line! Hit that line! Keep on going,&lt;br&gt; Move that ball right down the field!&lt;br&gt; Give a cheer. Rah! Rah! Never fear. Rah! Rah!&lt;br&gt; Arkansas will never yield!&lt;br&gt; On your toes, Razorbacks, to the finish,&lt;br&gt; Carry on with all your might!&lt;br&gt; For it's A-A-A-R-K-A-N-S-A-S for Arkansas!&lt;br&gt; Fight! Fight! Fi-i-i-ght!&lt;br&gt; </p>
<h3>School Colors and Mascot</h3>
<p>The school color of <a>cardinal red</a> (<a>Pantone</a> # 199) was chosen as the official school color by a vote of the student body in 1895. The two color choices were <a>cardinal</a> and <a>heliotrope</a>. White was added as a complementary color at a later date. [[Image:TuskMascot2.JPG|right|thumb|[[Tusk (mascot)|Tusk]], the live mascot for the University of Arkansas.]]</p>
<p>The University of Arkansas mascot has not always been the Razorbacks. From 1894, when the football program began, until 1910, the official mascot was the Cardinals to complement the school color of cardinal red. In 1909, according to school lore, the head football coach <a>Hugo Bezdek</a> gave a speech to a large group of students at the Fayetteville train station after returning from a victory over <a>LSU</a> in 1909 during an undefeated season. Coach Bezdek informed the crowd that his team had performed &quot;like a wild band of Razorback hogs.&quot; Although students had begun referring to the team as the Razorbacks as early as 1907, Bezdek's statement popularized the use of Razorback for the team. The Razorback, which is characterized by a ridged back and tenacious wild fighting ability, had long been associated with the backwoods of Arkansas. The students loved the comparison, and the nickname became increasingly popular. In 1910, the student body voted to change the official university mascot from the Cardinal to the Razorback.</p>
<p>The live mascot tradition dates back to the 1960s and a number of hogs have represented Arkansas through the years. <a>Tusk</a>, a 380-pound Russian boar that closely resembles a wild razorback hog, is the current official live mascot. He resides on a local farm and leaves his home to attend all Arkansas home football games, and other select events.</p>
<p>Additionally, the University of Arkansas has a family of uniformed mascots. &quot;Big Red&quot;, (also known as the &quot;Fighting Razorback&quot;), is the traditional mascot for the university and attends all athletic events. &quot;Sue E&quot; is the female hog and &quot;Pork Chop&quot; is the kid mascot. &quot;Boss Hog&quot; is a nine-foot inflatable mascot that joined the mascot family during the 1998-99 football season.</p>
<p>[[Image:09-02-06-UArkBand-A.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The Razorback Marching Band in formation at [[Donald W. Reynolds Razorback Stadium|Razorback Stadium]].]]</p>
<h3>Razorback Marching Band</h3>
<p> The Razorback Marching Band, one of the oldest collegiate bands in the United States, was formed in 1874 as the Cadet Corps Band as part of the military art department. The band participated in all the formalities of the Military Art Department, as well as playing for football games, pageants, and commencement exercises. In 1947, following a steady post World War II growth, the Cadet Corp Band was divided into the three current bands, a football band, a concert band, and an R.O.T.C. band. In 1956, the band adopted the name &quot;Marching Razorbacks&quot;. In 2006, the now 340 member Razorback marching band was awarded the highest honor bestowed upon a collegiate marching band, the <a>Sudler Trophy</a>.</p>
<h2>Clubs and organizations on campus</h2>
<p>There are over 350 registered student organizations (RSOs) including special interest, religious, international and cultural organizations, honorary and professional service groups, and more.</p>
<p>The most recognized RSO on campus is the Associated Student Government, sometimes simply called &quot;ASG&quot;.  ASG is active in managing student fees, meeting with key University administrators and is actively involved in many important decisions made on the University of Arkansas Campus.  Perhaps the most significant program on campus, ASG, along with University Parking &amp; Transit, and with the support of the DRJ-III Memorial Foundation, manage the Safe Ride program which gives students a safe ride home from any unsafe or uncomfortable situation.</p>
<p>Arkansas is home of <a>UATV</a>, a student-run television station, and The Arkansas Traveler, a regional-award winning newspaper established in 1906. The university is also home to two radio stations: <a>KUAF</a>, a <a>public radio</a> station and <a>NPR</a> affiliate, and <a>KXUA</a>, an eclectic student-run station.</p>
<p>The University of Arkansas Press is known for publishing works on local and Southern history, including several by former President <a>Jimmy Carter</a> and the former national poet laureate <a>Billy Collins</a>.</p>
<h3>Distinguished Lecture and Headliner Series</h3>
<p>One of the most visible student-run organizations is University Programs, a group of students dedicated to bringing comedians, concerts, and lecturers to campus. Notable speakers and bands to visit the University of Arkansas as a result of the organization include lectures by <a>Ehud Barak</a>, <a>Dave Barry</a>, <a>Benazir Bhutto</a>, <a>Al Franken</a>, <a>Malcolm Gladwell</a>, <a>James Earl Jones</a>, <a>Martin Luther King III</a>, <a>T.

Seventeen Arkansas graduates have held the position of Governor, including the current <a>Governor of Arkansas</a> <a>Mike Beebe</a> who has represented Arkansas since 2007. Twenty-six Arkansas Graduates have also represented the State of Arkansas in the <a>United States House of Representatives</a> in every Congress since the start of the <a>57th Congress</a> in 1901, including two current members in <a>John Boozman</a> since 2001 and <a>Robert Marion Berry</a> since 1997. Six Arkansas graduates have also held at least one <a>US Senate</a> seat from Arkansas since 1945, and from 1979-2003 held both seats, including current <a>US Senator</a> <a>Mark Pryor</a> since 2003.</p>
<p>Arkansas alumni have made contributions to the business world and academia.  Alumni include <a>Dallas Cowboys</a> owner <a>Jerry Jones</a>. Other Arkansas business alumni include executives of major corporations like <a>S. Robson Walton</a> of <a>Wal-Mart</a>, <a>Thomas A. Mars</a> of <a>Mars, Incorporated</a>, <a>Scott T.
