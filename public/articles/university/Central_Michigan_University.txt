<p><strong>Central Michigan University</strong> (also known as <strong>CMU</strong>) is a <a>coeducational</a> <a>state university</a> located in <a>Mount Pleasant</a> in the <a>U.S.</a> <a>state</a> of <a>Michigan</a>. Established in 1892, Central Michigan University is one of the nation&#x2019;s 100 largest public universities and the fourth largest in Michigan (behind <a>Michigan &#x2013; Ann Arbor</a>, <a>Michigan State</a>, and <a>Wayne State</a>) with more than 20,000 students on its Mount Pleasant campus and another 7,000 enrolled online and at more than 60 locations worldwide.  CMU offers 200 academic programs at the undergraduate, master&#x2019;s, specialist and doctoral levels, including nationally recognized programs in entrepreneurship, journalism, music, audiology, teacher education, psychology and physician assistant. CMU has also established a College of Medicine, scheduled to open in 2012. CMU competes in the NCAA&#x2019;s Division I Mid-American Conference in seven men&#x2019;s and nine women&#x2019;s sports.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Central opened its doors in 1892 as the <strong>Central Michigan Normal School and Business Institute</strong>. At that time, few of the state's teachers received any formal training in teaching. School founders made teacher training their mission in founding the state's second <a>normal school</a>.  The seal was transcribed in 1892 to read: Sapientia, Virtus, Amicitia &#x2013; Wisdom, Virtue, and Friendship.</p>
<p>Thirty-one students attended classes in second-floor rooms over an office on the corner of Main and Michigan streets in downtown Mount Pleasant. Most students at the time were eighth-grade graduates, attending the &quot;Normal&quot; for a few weeks or months prior to beginning their careers as teachers. Within the first two years, land was acquired and a $10,000 Normal School Building was constructed where Warriner Hall now stands. the Center for Professional and Personal Ethics (also known as the &quot;CPPE&quot;) sponsors visits by nationally and internationally known speakers. The Center focuses on the moral development of CMU students.  To that end, students working with the Center have created an academic integrity handbook known by the CMU community as the <em>CMU Redbook;</em> have focused on voter education and help to educate their peers about how Michigan election law affects student voters; and produce a weekly internet radio show &quot;ethics-talk&quot; which is focused on issues that are of particular interest to students.  Among the topics that are discussed on ethics-talk are academic integrity, procrastination, and motivation. The Center for Professional &amp; Personal Ethics also sponsors an annual Social Entrepreneurship competition called &quot;Inspire Michigan&quot;.  Students compete by pitching their ideas for projects that will improve CMU and/or Michigan communities. Winners receive development accounts and support to help grow their visions into realities.</p>
<h2>Graduate School</h2>
<p>The Central Michigan University College of Graduate Studies provides over 70 graduate degree programs at the Master's, Specialist, or Doctoral levels.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p> <a>right|thumb|160px|The CMU Chippewas logo, current as of 2007</a></p>
<p>The school's athletics programs are affiliated with the <a>NCAA Division I-A</a> and compete in the <a>Mid-American Conference</a>. The school colors are maroon and gold, and the school, and its students and alumni are referred to as <em>Chippewas</em> which is sometimes shortened to <em>Chips</em>. This nickname is used with consent of the nearby <a>Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe</a>, who have a positive relationship with the university. The university was placed on the <a>NCAA</a>'s list of schools with &quot;hostile and abusive&quot; nicknames in August 2005, but appealed the decision, with the support of the <a>Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe</a>. On September 2, 2005 the university announced that their appeal of the decision had been upheld.</p>
<p>The school athletics logo has changed over time, once featuring an Indian spear, but is now a stylized block letter &quot;C&quot;. Within the university this logo is often referred to as the &quot;flying C&quot; or the &quot;running C&quot;, although it is actually called the &quot;action C&quot;. The current version of the athletic trademark was first used in 1997.  The &quot;flying C&quot; logo was designed by IET Department undergraduate student, Jason Prout, in 1995.</p>
<p>CMU's football team won the second <a>NCAA</a> Division II national championship in 1974 by defeating the <a>University of Delaware</a> 54 to 14.  The team was voted national champion in the Associated Press College Division poll.  The Chips have also been national runner-up twice.  In 1958 the men's swimming and diving team was runner-up to <a>North Central College</a> at the second annual <a>NAIA</a> national meet, which was held in Muncie, Ind.  Central's baseball team was <a>NCAA</a> Division II runner-up in 1971, having lost to <a>Florida Southern College</a> 4 to 0 in the championship game. In 1994, 2006 and 2007 they won the MAC Championship in football. In 2006 against <a>Ohio</a> and then defeated <a>Middle Tennessee State</a> in the <a>Motor City Bowl</a>.  The Chippewas won a second consecutive MAC Championship in 2007, with a 35&#x2013;10 victory over Miami (OH).  In 2009, the Chippewas won their third MAC football title in four years, and went on to defeat Troy in the GMAC Bowl.  Their final record of 12&#x2013;2 tied a school record for victories.  They finished the season ranked #23 in the final AP Poll and #24 in the final Coaches Poll marking the first time that a CMU football team had ever ended the season ranked in the Top 25 at the NCAA Division I-FBS level.  Frequently defeating both the University of Michigan and Michigan State University in dual meets, CMU's wrestling team won its 10th straight MAC championship and seventh straight conference tournament title in 2008. The Chippewas tied for seventh at the NCAA Championships, scoring a school-record 69 points. Four individuals earned All-America honors.</p>
<p>CMU was a member of the <a>Interstate Intercollegiate Athletic Conference</a> from 1950&#x2013;1970.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<h3>Residence life</h3>
<p>Central Michigan University is home to 22 on-campus residence halls, arranged in four areas throughout the campus.  In 2006, the 21st and 22nd residence halls on campus opened in what was currently the East complex.</p>
<ul>
  <li>North Residence Halls: Larzelere, Trout, Calkins, Robinson, Barnes</li>
  <li>South Residence Halls: Beddow, Merrill, Thorpe, Sweeney</li>
  <li>East Residence Halls: Saxe, Herrig, Woldt, Emmons; Celani and Fabiano</li>
  <li>The Towers: Carey, Cobb, Troutman and Wheeler (&quot;The Original Towers&quot;), Campbell, Kesseler and Kulhavi (&quot;The New Towers&quot;)</li>
</ul>
<p><a>thumb|Kulhavi Hall at the Towers</a> <a>thumb|Robinson Hall at North Campus</a></p>
<p>All residence halls except for some Barnes Hall rooms, Robinson Hall, Celani, Fabiano and the remaining Towers are two-bedroom suites designed for 4 or 5 persons. The Original Towers, nine-story high-rise residence halls designed primarily for freshmen, feature one-bedroom suites. The New Towers, as well as Fabiano and Celani, are designed primarily for upperclassmen, and are four-bedroom suites. Robinson Hall and the original section of Barnes are the only residence halls designed for double occupancy. Residents of both the New Towers, Celani, Fabiano, and Robinson Hall pay an additional charge over the standard room and board rate.</p>
<p>Each district is connected to one of four Residential Restaurants. The Towers features the RFoC, or Real Food on Campus, and the East Complex features the Fresh Food Company.  Each area also has an after hours snack shop. Only Barnes Hall, the oldest residence hall at CMU, is not directly connected to a residential restaurant. The original section of Barnes Hall is also the only part of any residence hall on campus that has community bathrooms.</p>
<p>Some residence halls are designated as official <a>Residential Colleges</a>, associated with a particular academic department, allowing students who choose to live there opportunities for study and collaboration with other students from similar programs.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Carey Hall-Business</li>
  <li>Herrig Hall-Music</li>
  <li>Emmons Hall-Health Professions</li>
  <li>Woldt Hall-Science and Technology</li>
  <li>Calkins Hall-Education</li>
  <li>Larzelere and Trout Halls-Honors Program</li>
  <li>Barnes Hall &#x2013; Leadership Advancement Scholars</li>
</ul>
<p>CMU offers only co-ed residence halls, with Sweeney Hall converting from females only in the fall of 2010. Since the Fall 2005 semester, Calkins Hall, home of the Education <a>residential college</a>, is co-educational, after a long history of being females only. The other residence halls are either co-ed by building or by floor.  In the fall of 2007, Beddow and Thorpe Halls became co-ed due to a decline in students requesting to live in single-gender residence halls. In the fall of 2008, Merrill Hall was added as a co-ed residence hall, leaving Sweeney Hall to be the only same gender hall on campus.</p>
<p>Construction began on two more buildings, Celani and Fabiano, near the East Quad in the spring of 2005. The buildings are somewhat similar in design to the New Towers, opened in 2003. On December 1, 2005, one of the buildings was named The Ben and Marion Celani Residence hall to recognize the generosity of Detroit area businessman Thomas Celani and his wife Vicki.  On April 20, 2006, the remaining building was named the Fabiano Family Residence Hall, recognizing their contribution to the school.  John S. Fabiano served on the board of trustees 1999&#x2013;2004, and also owns the Fabiano Brothers Inc, an alcohol distribution company.  These two new halls opened for the fall semester of 2006, along with a new Residential Restaurant to serve the residents of the six East Area halls.</p>
