<h1>Relocation Plans</h1>
<p>In 2002, the State of Hawai<img>i <a>Board of Land and Natural Resources</a> (Land Board), as a condition of other land transactions between the State of Hawai<img>i and the <a>James Campbell</a> estate, deeded an area of land just over  with the sole purpose of constructing a new campus for the University of Hawai<img>i - West O<img>ahu in <a>Kapolei</a>. </p>
<p>The University of Hawai<img>i has entered into an agreement with Hunt Building Corporation and Hawaii Renaissance Builders LLC, (collectively Hunt), under which Hunt has agreed to purchase approximately  of the deeded  for $100 million.

<p>The full-fledged campus is expected to serve about 7,500 students with around 1,000 faculty and staff, and is expected to alleviate traffic into downtown Honolulu and M&#x0101;noa where the flagship campus is located.</p>
