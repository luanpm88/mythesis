<h2>History</h2>
<p>The <a>Virginia General Assembly</a> passed a resolution in January 1956, establishing a branch college of the <a>University of Virginia</a> in <a>Northern Virginia</a>. In September 1957 the new college opened its doors to seventeen students, all of whom enrolled as freshmen in a renovated elementary school building at <a>Bailey's Crossroads</a>. John Norville Gibson Finley served as Director of the new branch, which was known as University College.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://hdl.handle.net/1920/2712</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>[[Image:George Mason.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[George Mason]], (1725-1792) after whom the University is named.]] The city of Fairfax purchased and donated  of land to the University of Virginia for the college's new site,&lt;ref&gt;<a>A Brief History of George Mason University</a> George Mason University&lt;/ref&gt; which was referred to as the <a>Fairfax Campus</a>. In 1959, the <a>Board of Visitors</a> of UVA selected a permanent name for the college: George Mason College of the University of Virginia. The Fairfax campus construction planning that began in early 1960 showed visible results when the development of the first  of Fairfax Campus began in 1962. In the Fall of 1964 the new campus welcomed 356 students.</p>
<p>Local jurisdictions of <a>Fairfax County</a>, <a>Arlington County</a>, and the cities of <a>Alexandria</a> and <a>Falls Church</a> agreed to appropriate $3 million to purchase land adjacent to Mason to provide for a  Fairfax Campus in 1966 with the intention that the institution would expand into a regional university of major proportions, including the granting of graduate degrees.</p>
<p>On April 7, 1972 the <a>Virginia General Assembly</a> enacted legislation which separated George Mason College from its parent institution, the <a>University of Virginia</a>. Renamed that day by the legislation, George Mason College became George Mason University.</p>
<p>In 1978, the George Mason University Foundation purchased the former Kann's department store in Arlington. In March 1979 the Virginia General Assembly authorized the establishment of the George Mason University School of Law (GMUSL) - contingent on the transfer of the Kann's building to George Mason University.  GMUSL began operations in that building on July 1, 1979 and received provisional accreditation from the American Bar Association in 1980.  The ABA granted full approval to GMUSL in 1986.</p>
<p>Also, in 1979, the university moved all of its athletic programs to <a>NCAA</a> Division I. Enrollment that year passed 11,000. The university opened its Arlington campus in 1982, two blocks from the <a>Virginia Square-GMU station</a> in Arlington. In 1986 the university's governing body, the Board of Visitors, approved a new master plan for the year based on an enrollment of 20,000 full-time students with housing for 5,000 students by 1995. That same year university housing opened to bring the total number of residential students to 700.</p>
<p>Through a bequest of Russian immigrant Shelley Krasnow the University established the <a>Krasnow Institute for Advanced Study</a> in 1991. The Institute was created to further the understanding of the mind and intelligence by combining the fields of <a>cognitive psychology</a>, <a>neurobiology</a>, and <a>artificial intelligence</a>. In 1992, Mason's new Prince William Institute began classes in a temporary site in <a>Manassas, Virginia</a>. The Institute moved to a permanent  site located on the <a>Rt. 234</a> bypass, ten miles (16&nbsp;km) south of Manassas, by the year 1997, and is now known as the Prince William Campus. The university graduated more than 5,000 students that following spring.</p>
<p>While George Mason University is young compared to established research universities in Virginia, it has grown rapidly, reaching an enrollment of 30,714 students in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2005 report issued by the university, enrollment is expected to reach 35,000 students by 2011 with more than 7,000 resident students.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Fall Headcount Enrollment</a> State Council of Higher Education for Virginia&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>In 2002, Mason celebrated its 30th anniversary as a university by launching its first capital campaign, trying to raise $110 million. The school raised $142 million, $32 million more than its goal. The George Mason University logo, originally designed in 1982, was updated in 2004.</p>
<p>In 2008, the School of Management celebrated its 30th anniversary. Also, in 2008 Mason changed its mascot from the &quot;Gunston&quot; animal to the &quot;Patriot&quot;.</p>

<h3>Fairfax</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|280px|The new Volgenau School of Information Technology and Engineering building.</a></p>
<p>The main campus of George Mason University is situated on  just south of the <a>City of Fairfax, Virginia</a> in central <a>Fairfax County</a>, approximately  west of <a>Washington, D.C.</a></p>
<p>The Fairfax campus is served on the <a>Washington Metro</a> by the <a>Vienna/Fairfax-GMU</a> station on the <a>Orange line</a>. A 15 minute shuttle in addition to the <a>CUE</a> bus, free for students with a Mason ID card, serves the students through routes from the Metro station to the University.&lt;ref&gt;[<a>http://shuttle.gmu.edu/</a>] Mason Shuttle Services&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[<a>http://www.fairfaxva.gov/CUEBus/CUEBus.asp</a>] Cue Bus System&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h4>Design and construction</h4>
<p>In the early 1960s four buildings were constructed around a lawn in Fairfax, appropriately named East, West, North (later, Krug Hall), and South (later, Finley Hall). The first four structures, today dubbed &quot;The Original Four,&quot; &quot;around a lawn&quot; were understood as a clear reference to the buildings around <a>The Lawn</a> of the University of Virginia in <a>Charlottesville</a>. In addition, in the words of the architects, the architecture of the buildings was meant to reflect <a>Jeffersonian</a> influence through the use of red brick with buff colored mortar, white vertical columns, and sloped shingled roofs.</p>
<p>Master plans were developed to incorporate further development, which saw new additions such as Fenwick Library and Lecture Hall. By 1979 master plan development was handled by the firm of <a>Sasaki &amp; Associates</a>, which continued to work alongside the university in the years that followed. Student housing first became available in 1977. The 1980s saw the biggest expansion with new buildings being added on each year including the <a>Patriot Center</a>.</p>
<p>Recent years have seen the most activity on campus. Innovation Hall, a new academic building, opened in 2003. Student apartment buildings Liberty Square and Potomac Heights opened in 2004 to accommodate an unprecedented demand from students. The fall of 2005 saw the number of residential students surpass 4,100. The Sandy Creek parking deck and Research I, a four-story  facility that includes faculty offices and instructional and research laboratories, opened in 2006. The latter includes a semi-detached tower that houses the Astronomy Department&#x2019;s rooftop telescope.</p>
<p>The Fairfax campus is undergoing a massive, $900 million construction campaign (between 2002&#x2013;2012) that includes a new Information Technology and Engineering building, a new Visual and Performing Arts building, a new dining hall, a renovated Physical Education building (in addition to the recently renovated Aquatic and Fitness Center), and a new residential building. Also, George Mason is planning a new hotel and conference center, and yet another new residential building. Even the roads are changing: the Patriot Circle has received a new roundabout this summer. By 2010, Mason will have over  of new building space as compared to 2006. Not only is Mason experiencing a construction boom, but it also has another Master Plan and Library Master Plan in the works. The Fairfax campus is undergoing a complete transformation.</p>
<h4>Housing and residence life</h4>
<p><a>right|280px|thumb|Liberty Square, an upperclassmen residence area which opened in 2003</a> Fairfax is the only campus of George Mason University with on-campus student housing. There are five housing areas housing approximately 5,000 students: President's Park, DUCC (Dominion Hall, University Commons and Commonwealth Hall), TAP (Townhouses, Student Apartments), YRC (Liberty Square and Potomac Heights) and the newest housing area Chesapeake (Tidewater, Blue Ridge, Shenandoah, Piedmont and Northern Neck). A sixth housing area is currently under construction to house an additional thousand students.</p>
<p>York River Corner includes Liberty Square and Potomac Heights, built in 2003. YRC houses approximately 1,000 upperclassmen combined, with about 500 at each development. Both are fully furnished apartments in two, four, or six-person units.</p>
<p><a>thumb|left|285px|A view of George Mason's Chesapeake housing area.</a> Chesapeake includes the buildings Tidewater, Piedmont, Blue Ridge , Shenandoah and Northern Neck.  Northern Neck consists of Upperclassmen housing in Apartment style rooms, while the other buildings feature combinations of various suite style rooms.  The area also contains a Conference Space, Convenience Store, Dining Hall, Fitness Facility, and a future Starbucks (completed in Spring 2009).</p>
<p><a>right|280px|thumb|President's Park</a> <a>President's Park</a> opened in 1989 and is the largest housing area, with more than 1,000 students living in two, three, or four person dorm rooms. President's Park is exclusively for freshman. There are thirteen residential buildings, all named after past <a>U.S. Presidents</a>, surrounding <a>Eisenhower</a> hall in the center, with a diner named Ike's, vending areas, study lounge, and TV lounge.</p>
<p>Dominion Hall, University Commons and Commonwealth Hall, or DUCC, houses approximately one-thousand students, including some freshmen, sophomores and primarily upper-class students. Dominion and Commonwealth Hall were built in 1981 and are five-story buildings offering double-occupancy suite-style rooms for upperclassmen. University Commons was built in 1986 and comprises eight buildings.</p>
<p>Townhouses, Student Apartments, Patriots Village, houses approximately 1,000 upperclassmen. The townhouses and student apartments became available in 1987. Patriots Village, which has modules, became available from 1984 through 1988. There are 35 two-bedroom townhouses located 1/8th of a mile north of the campus on <a>State Route 123</a>. In summer 2008 the Patriot Village area was demolished to make room for a hotel and conference center. Student Apartments were renovated in 2002 and are located inside Patriot Circle, just west of the main quad. They comprise nine three-story buildings of one, two, and three-bedroom units. Patriots Village consists of dozens of permanent <a>modulars</a> located outside of Patriot Circle, just east of Ox Road, offering modular and suite-style units.</p>

<h3>Schools and colleges</h3>
<p>Research at Mason is organized into centers, laboratories, and collaborative programs.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Research and Scholarship</a> George Mason University&lt;/ref&gt; These include the College of Humanities and Social Sciences, the College of Education and Human Development, New Century College, the College of Health and Human Services, the College of Visual and Performing Arts, the Institute for Conflict Analysis and Resolution, the <a>Krasnow Institute for Advanced Study</a>, the School of Computational Sciences, the Volgenau <a>School of Information Technology and Engineering</a>, the <a>School of Law</a>, the <a>School of Public Policy</a>, the College of Science, and the School of Management. In addition, Mason's Office of the <a>Provost</a> includes research centers that deal with economics, global education, and teaching excellence.</p>
<p>In addition to a business undergraduate major and minor, Mason's School of Management has graduate programs for the Master of Business Administration degree (MBA) with a wide variety of concentrations/specializations, an Executive Master of Business Administration degree (EMBA), a Master of Science in Accounting (MSA), a joint MBA/MSA degree and a Master of Science in Technology Management degree.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p>  The school's sports teams are called the Patriots. The university's men's and women's sports teams participate in the <a>NCAA</a>'s <a>Division I</a>, and are members of the <a>Colonial Athletic Association</a>, or CAA. The school's colors are green and gold. George Mason has two NCAA Division I National Championship to its credit; <a>1985</a> <a>Women's Soccer</a> and <a>1996</a> <a>Men's Indoor Track &amp; Field</a>.</p>
<p>George Mason University was catapulted into the national spotlight in March 2006, when its men's basketball team qualified for the <a>Final Four</a> of the <a>NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament</a> by defeating the <a>Michigan State Spartans</a>, the defending champion <a>North Carolina Tar Heels</a>, the <a>Wichita State Shockers</a>, and the top-seeded <a>Connecticut Huskies</a>. Their &quot;<a>Cinderella</a>&quot; journey ended in the Final Four with a loss to the eventual tournament champion <a>Florida Gators</a> by a score of 73-58.&lt;ref&gt;[<a>http://sports.yahoo.com/ncaab/recap;_ylt=AiztqaWfF1ZYwdwwkU.FwJfevbYF?gid=200604010210</a>] Yahoo! Sports&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the team's success in the tournament, the Patriots were ranked 8th in the final <a>ESPN</a>/<a>USA Today</a> Poll for the <a>2005-06 season.</a> <em><a>The New York Times</a></em>, <em><a>The Washington Post</a></em>, <em><a>Baltimore Sun</a></em>, and <em><a>USA Today</a></em> featured the story on their front pages, and was ranked by several publications as the sports story of the year.</p>
<p>The Patriots, who had never won an NCAA tournament game before 2006, became the first team from the CAA to crash the Final Four and were the first true <a>mid-major</a> conference team since 1979 to do so (that year, the <a>Larry Bird</a>-led <a>Indiana State Sycamores</a> as a #1 seed, and the <a>Penn Quakers</a> as a #9 seed both reached the Final Four). As #11-seeds, the 2006 Patriots also tied the 1986 <a>LSU Tigers</a> as the lowest-seeded team ever to reach the Final Four.</p>
<p>In <a>2008</a>, the Patriots returned to the <a>NCAA Tournament</a> after winning the CAA Tournament. They were given a 12 seed and matched up against 5th-seeded <a>Notre Dame</a>. The Patriots were unable to make another miracle run, losing to the Irish by a score of 68-50.</p>
<h2>Organizations</h2>
<p>George Mason offers more than 200 clubs and organizations, including 16 <a>fraternities</a>, 15 <a>sororities</a>, 24 International-student organizations, 25 religious organizations, a student programming board, <a>student government</a>, club sports, debate team, and student media. Mason also offers an <a>Army</a> <a>ROTC</a> program, called The &quot;Patriot Battalion.&quot; Mason's club sports include <a>ultimate frisbee</a>, <a>crew</a>, <a>equestrian</a>, <a>field hockey</a>, football, lacrosse, <a>underwater hockey</a>, fencing, and <a>rugby</a>.</p>
<p>The George Mason University Forensics program is one of the top ranked competitive speech teams in the United States and has achieved international recognition in the field of communication studies.&lt;ref&gt;[<a>http://www.americanforensics.org/organization/awards/champions-national-i/champions-national-individual-events-tou</a>]&lt;/ref&gt; The team was founded in 1970 and has won nearly 10,000 individual speech awards. In 2010 the team placed 4th at the <a>American Forensics Association National Tournament</a> and won the International Forensics Association Championship. The Forensics Program has been extremely active on the George Mason campus with an active Community Service Committee. GMU hosts the annual Virginia is for Lovers collegiate speech tournament, the Patriot Games scholastic speech competition (which in 2009 had over 1,000 entries), and also will host the 2011 <a>Catholic Forensics Association Grand National Tournament</a>. Also, in 2010 Forensics students Brennan Morris, Colston Reid, Billy Strong, and Mickey Cox were George Mason University&#x2019;s highlight speakers at the State Legislature. Currently Dr. Peter Pober is the Program Director with Jeremy Hodgson as Assistant Director.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://gmuforensics.org/</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>Media</h3>
<p>Mason offers two regular print publications, <em><a>Broadside</a></em>, the <a>student newspaper</a>, and the <em>Mason Gazette</em>, the University-published newspaper. Mason also operates a <a>Campus radio</a> station, <a>WGMU Radio</a>. The online radio station offers music, entertainment, news, and public affairs relating to the University community, regional area and the country. The Mason Cable Network, or MCN, is the student organized and operated television station, and offers student produced entertainment and information on channel 89, available on the Fairfax campus of GMU. Mason also sponsors several student-run publications through its Office of Student Media,&lt;ref&gt;[<a>http://studentmedia.gmu.edu/</a>]&lt;/ref&gt; including the <em>VoxPop</em>, a feature magazine, Connect2Mason, an online media and news convergence Web site,&lt;ref&gt;[<a>http://www.connect2mason.com/</a>]&lt;/ref&gt; <em>Volition</em>, an undergraduate student literary and art magazine, <em>Phoebe</em>, a graduate literary journal, <em>So to Speak</em>, a feminist literary journal, <em>GMView and Senior Speak</em>, an annual yearbook publication and video, <em>New Voices in Public Policy</em>, School of Public Policy student journal, and <em>Hispanic Culture Review</em>, a student bilingual (Spanish/English) journal on Hispanic literature and culture.</p>
<p>Between approximately 1993 and 1998, George Mason University was also the home of &quot;The Fractal: Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy.&quot;</p>
<p>Between 1999 and 2005, the <a>underground newspaper</a> Expulsion was distributed on the Mason campus. It also experienced a brief online resurgence in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[<a>http://web.archive.org/web/*/expulsion.org</a>]&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The staff of the <a>Center for History and New Media</a> produces a podcast called <em>Digital Campus</em>.</p>
<p>In Fall 2008, the satirical online newspaper, <em>The Mason Squire</em>, premiered.&lt;ref&gt;[<a>http://themasonsquire.com/about/</a>]&lt;/ref&gt; The site featured fake news stories criticizing the university. The newspaper's mottos were &quot;Because fake news doesn't report itself&quot; and &quot;Fake news just got a whole lot sexier.&quot; However, the site has been inactive since late 2009.</p>
<h3>Fraternity and sorority life</h3>
<p> George Mason University does not have traditional Fraternity &amp; Sorority housing or a &quot;Greek row.&quot;  For several years, three Panhellenic Council organizations had established &quot;Living/Learning Floors&quot; in the University Commons.  <a>Alpha Omicron Pi</a> had a floor 2004 - 2010, <a>Gamma Phi Beta</a> had a floor 2006 - 2010, and <a>Alpha Phi</a> had a floor 2007 - 2010.</p>
<p>Officially, Mason refers to &quot;Greek Life&quot; as &quot;Fraternity &amp; Sorority Life&quot; to avoid confusion with the Hellenic Society club, a student organization focusing on the people and culture of Greece.</p>
<p>Most organizations in the Interfraternity Council (IFC) and Panhellenic Council (PHC) hold one or two large charitable events each year. Most organizations in the National Pan-Hellenic Conference (NPHC) and Multicultural Greek Council (MGC) hold a series of smaller charitable events throughout the year. The NPHC is also known for its annual Step Show.</p>
<p>The most well-known event associated with Fraternity &amp; Sorority Life on campus is held each spring and is called Greek Week. This annual event includes competitive sporting and trivia events, charitable fund raising, and is usually ended with Greek Sing. Organizations participating in Greek Sing put together 10-15 minute themed shows which have included extravagant costumes, set designs, lighting displays, multimedia presentations, dances, singing, acrobatics, and more.</p>
<p>PHC holds a formal recruitment each fall. Informal recruitment is held in spring. Many PHC organizations also offer continuous open recruitment (or continuous open bidding) after the designated recruitment period. IFC has a designated one-week rush period in the fall and spring. This week is regulated and monitored, but participants are not registered or tracked.</p>
