<p>The <strong>European Graduate School</strong> (<strong>EGS</strong>) in <a>Saas-Fee, Switzerland</a> is a privately funded <a>graduate school</a> founded by the non-profit European Foundation of Interdisciplinary Studies. Its <a>German</a> name is <em>Europ&#x00e4;ische Universit&#x00e4;t f&#x00fc;r Interdisziplin&#x00e4;re Studien</em> (&quot;European University for Interdisciplinary Studies&quot;). It is governed by a presidential board that includes a representative of the <a>Swiss</a> canton of <a>Valais</a>. Instruction is in English.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>EGS was established in 1994 as a <a>postgraduate</a> degree-granting school with two divisions: Media and Communications; and Arts, Health and Society.  Founding contributors include thinkers such as <a>Jacques Derrida</a> and <a>Jean-Fran&#x00e7;ois Lyotard</a>. school controlled by a school council (&quot;Hochschulrat&quot;) in which the Canton of Valais is represented with at least one member. The school is supervised by representatives of the education ministry of the Canton of Valais, the <a>Graduate School of Music and Theater</a>, Hamburg, the <a>Appalachian State University</a> in Boone, NC, and the <a>California Institute of Integral Studies</a> in San Francisco. </p>
<h2>Arts, Health and Society Division</h2>
<p>Offers certificate programs (MAPS and CAGS) and Masters and Doctoral degrees in Expressive Arts Therapy and Expressive Arts Coaching and Consulting, Education, and Social Change. The MA Programs in Expressive Arts are designed to further training and research in the therapeutic, coaching, consultative, educational and social use of the arts. The programs encourage students to take seriously the tradition and disciplines of the arts as they have evolved over the course of human history. In all societies up to the present, the arts have played an essential role in enabling human beings to make sense of their world, to live with suffering when necessary and to be able to celebrate the joy of life. Teaching takes place in the town of Saas Fee in the Swiss Alps (State of Valais, Switzerland) in two sessions each summer from June to August. Students and faculty from all over the world meet to participate in intensive training seminars. The doctoral program in Expressive Arts combines two Summer residential training's at EGS leading to a Certificate of Advanced Post-Graduate Studies (CAGS) with individualized dissertation research in the student's home country. The Summer training is conducted in English; dissertations can be written in English, German or French if suitable advisors can be found. The granting of the degree of Doctor of Philosophy by EGS has been approved by the Ministry of Education, Canton Wallis, Switzerland. </p>
<p>The format of a Graduate School for Professionals with training exclusively in Intensive Summer Seminars has the advantage that it can commit a faculty of excellent reputation who are internationally engaged leaders or founders in their field. Faculty members come from transdisciplinary practices that cross institutional boundaries. Advocate investigative learning and creative inquiry which embrace the stratified complexity of the concrete problems we face today. They are familiar with thinking that expands the horizon of established frameworks and creates networks between disciplines and institutions in both the private and public sector. Faculty that have joined EGS are enthusiastic about projects that engage the typical adult learner. They appreciate the benefit of the innovative learning that goes on between faculty, students and participants in on-going projects.</p>
<h2>Media and Communications Division</h2>
<p>[[Image:WikipediaCounterVandalism20060611.png|right|thumb|[[Jean-Luc Nancy]] and students at EGS, June 11, 2006]] The Media and Communication Department focuses on creative breakthroughs and theoretical paradigm shifts, bringing together master's and doctoral students with an interest in art, philosophy, communications, film, literature, internet, web and cyberspace studies with artists, writers, and philosophers.</p>

Visiting faculty have included <a>Giorgio Agamben</a>, <a>Chantal Akerman</a>, <a>Jean Baudrillard</a>, <a>Christopher Fynsk</a> , <a>Claude Lanzmann</a>, <a>Hans Ulrich Obrist</a>, <a>Krzysztof Zanussi</a>.</p>
<p>In 2006, <a>Slavoj &#x017d;i&#x017e;ek</a> became the Jacques Lacan Professor at EGS, which has helped to further publicize the school regionally and globally.</p>
<h2>Teaching philosophy</h2>
<p>Studies involve two years of coursework, including rigorous on-line writing requirements based upon a structured reading list, and two three-week summer seminars in Switzerland, during which students are evaluated for their active participation in approximately nine hours of seminars and lectures each day with visiting professors, philosophers, filmmakers, and artists and spend their final three years writing a thesis or dissertation, followed by a traditional oral defense.</p>
<p><a>Slavoj &#x017d;i&#x017e;ek</a> described his involvement in EGS in an interview with Swiss magazine <em><a>Die Weltwoche</a></em>: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>There is an international summer school, the European Graduate School... What's interesting with this school is the selection of the lecturers &ndash; there are well-known philosophers and artists from the whole world, including the filmmakers <a>Peter Greenaway</a> and <a>Volker Schl&#x00f6;ndorff</a>, the theorists <a>Donna Haraway</a> and <a>Sandy Stone</a>, and the philosophers <a>Giorgio Agamben</a>, <a>Alain Badiou</a> and I. We three are friends. We meet there each year, are engaged for three weeks. I can bring my wife, do a 90 minute lecture each morning and am free afterwards.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a>Slavoj &#x017d;i&#x017e;ek</a> also described the rigor and prestige of EGS as an academic institution during an interview in 2006: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>EGS...is not only a place to create an interaction between students...but giving them freedom, not freedom to do nothing, but precisely freedom to work in this creative inter-space. Also, the way curriculum, the way talks are done: We do very serious theoretical work here...I like how the school approaches me...You know, I had to be there for exams for the students...so I thought how should I terrorize them...and I told them, &quot;You ask yourself a question and then you answer it&quot;...Ah, but you know? They didn&#x2019;t have any excuse. They couldn&#x2019;t have said, &quot;Ah, sorry. You know, I could not answer you.&quot; They had to be at their best. No excuse...We are challenged to do so. No excuse...So it&#x2019;s wonderful to see how somebody like Badiou comes and, really, it&#x2019;s like work in progress that you can see...It&#x2019;s really serious work...It&#x2019;s enough mixing between students and professors as equals so that you can get real productive exchange, not just ritualistic questions, answers, and so on. I think this is what accounts for the growing success of EGS here. It&#x2019;s simply a negative proof of the failure of today&#x2019;s academia.</p>
