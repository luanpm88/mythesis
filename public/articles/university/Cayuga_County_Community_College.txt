<h2>History</h2>
<p>On April 9, 1953, the State University of New York (SUNY) Board of Trustees approved the establishment of a community college in Auburn under the sponsorship of the Auburn City School District. Auburn Community College opened its doors the following September in the former James Street Elementary School. It was the first community college developed entirely after the establishment of SUNY. When Cayuga County assumed sponsorship for the College in July 1975, the name was officially changed to Cayuga County Community College.</p>
<p>Sixty-nine students formed the first freshman class. They joined acting president Charles G. Hetherington, Ph.D., and the charter faculty in ushering in a new era of higher education for Central New York.</p>
<p>To accommodate a rising student population, the College moved in 1959 to the current Auburn campus on Franklin Street in the city of Auburn. Later construction added a cluster of facilities around the original classroom building, now known as the main building: the library (1964), the technology building (1970), the bookstore (1971), Spartan Hall (1980), and the nature center (1983).</p>
<p>A $6.5 million capital project for construction, renovation and remodeling&#x2014;including the &#x201c;link,&#x201d; bridging the main and technology buildings&#x2014;from 1989 to 1991 carried Cayuga into the 1990s.</p>
<p>In 1994, with the opening of the Fulton Campus, the College expanded its operations to branch out to Oswego County residents.</p>
<p>The most recent major capital project, totaling $10.3 million, was undertaken in 2000. Approximately half that amount provided for further upgrades to the Auburn campus for energy efficiency, online technology, classroom renovations, parking capacity, and space usage, while $5.1 million funded the construction of a new Regional Economic Center.</p>
<p>Opened in 2003, the Regional Economic Center housed classrooms for Cayuga students; the offices of several agencies providing employment services to area residents; the new home of the college&#x2019;s NASA-sponsored Institute for the Application of Geospatial Technology; and the college&#x2019;s Business and Industry Center, a workforce training complex.</p>
<p>Dr. Hetherington&#x2019;s presidency was succeeded by those of Albert T. Skinner, Ph.D. (1958&#x2013;77); John H. Anthony, Ed.D. (1977&#x2013;80); Helena B. Howe, J.D. (1980&#x2013;86); and Lawrence H. Poole, Ph.D. (1986&#x2013;96). Dennis Golladay, Ph.D. (1996-2007) Daniel Paul Larson, D.M.A, joined Cayuga as its seventh president in 2007.</p>
<p>The academic year 2003&#x2013;4 marked the 50th anniversary of Cayuga County Community College.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<h3>Auburn</h3>
<p>Cayuga consists of a main campus in Auburn, and a second in Fulton.  The Auburn Campus has a main structure that consists of 5 main sections referred to as &quot;buildings&quot;.  Those sections of the campus when facing the campus are from right to left: Spartan Hall, the Main Building, the Regional Economic Center, the Library Building, and the Tech Building.</p>
<h3>Fulton</h3>
<p>Located in Fulton NY in Oswego county, Cayuga opened an extension site in the city of Fulton in January 1994. The &quot;campus&quot; briefly consisted of two rented classrooms in the basement of the Fulton Education Center, until later in the year when classes and offices moved into the former Holy Family School building on West Third Street.</p>
<p>The current facility on Route 3 opened in the summer of 2001 as Cayuga's Fulton Extension Center. It was expanded in 2004 with additional classroom and office space to meet a dramatic rise in enrollment. In 2006, New York State granted the facility branch campus status, and the &quot;Fulton campus&quot; designation became official. </p>
<p>At the heart of the campus is the Learning Commons, housing an open computing lab with 30 computer workstations, a 54-seat Academic Support Center, and the Disabilities Services office. Also located within the Learning Commons is the library, providing continually expanding collections of print and nonprint resources for Fulton faculty and staff, instruction service, laptop computers, online access to all electronic resources, and daily delivery of items from the Auburn collections. </p>
<p>The Fulton campus also features 12 general classrooms, distance-learning and video conferencing facilities, 3 additional computer labs (with a total of 76 computer workstations) and an art room. The science area includes an interdisciplinary science classroom, prep room, and office, with provisions for future lab space. The Fulton campus also houses business and industry training facilities, a full-service bookstore, and a student lounge.</p>
<h2>Governance</h2>

The Governor appoints four trustees for seven-year terms, five are appointed by the Cayuga County Legislature for seven-year terms, and a student trustee is elected annually and serves for one year. Daniel Paul Larson became Cayuga's seventh president in 2007.</p>
