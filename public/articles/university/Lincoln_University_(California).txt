<h2>History</h2>
<p>Named to honor the life and work of President <a>Abraham Lincoln</a>, Lincoln University was founded and chartered under the laws of California in 1926.   The first university officers were Benjamin Franklin Lickey, president, and Edward J. Silver, vice president and educational director. Lickey with his wife Susan had in 1919 founded a law study program in <a>San Francisco</a> for veterans returning after the <a>First World War</a> and other working adults which offered evening classes to part-time students while he was working as the western representative of the Law Department of the <a>La Salle Extension University</a> of <a>Chicago</a> which offered degrees through <a>correspondence courses</a>. The program developed into a <a>tutorial</a> center with a broader curriculum. One of its early slogans was &quot;The Shortcut to Success&quot; and it offered &quot;reasonable terms&quot; and a &quot;money-back guarantee.&quot; </p>
<p>By 1927 Lincoln University was operating on the Arcade Floor of the Phelan Building on Market Street in San Francisco with Colleges of Law and Commerce and a Department of Special Courses and Coaching, offering both day and evening classes as a <a>co-educational</a> institution. An advertisement of that year showed Lincoln University offering college courses in law, commerce, foreign trade, and business administration and special courses and coaching in bar examination preparation, advertising, journalism, and public speaking. It also maintained a <a>junior college</a> and <a>high school</a> program which operated a preparatory school and special preparation for <a>College Board</a> examinations. At this time Lickey served as president of Lincoln University while continuing as the agent of LaSalle Extension University.</p>
<p>Its nonprofit status was recognized by the <a>Internal Revenue Service</a> in 1950 and in 1961 a second campus was opened in <a>San Jose</a>. By 1987 the San Jose campus had become the location of the university's law school programs. It separated in 1993 to become the independent <a>Lincoln Law School of San Jose</a>. The university moved from <a>San Francisco</a> to Oakland in December 1999.</p>
