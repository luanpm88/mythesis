<p></p>
<p>The <strong>Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich</strong> () or <strong>ETH Z&#x00fc;rich</strong> (<strong>ETHZ</strong>) is an engineering, science and technology <a>university</a> in the <a>City of Zurich</a>, <a>Switzerland</a>.  Like its sister institution <a>&#x00c9;cole Polytechnique F&#x00e9;d&#x00e9;rale de Lausanne</a> (EPFL), it is an integral part of the <a>ETH Domain</a> that is directly subordinate to the <a>Federal Department of Home Affairs</a>.</p>
<p>ETHZ is ranked among the top universities in the world. It is said to be Europe's equivalent to the American <a>M.I.T.</a> due to its emphasis on leading research and academic excellence. It is currently ranked 7th best university in Engineering, Science and Technology. 21 <a>Nobel Prize</a>s have been awarded to students or professors of the Institute in the past, the most famous of them being <a>Albert Einstein</a> in 1921, and the most recent being <a>Richard F. Heck</a> in 2010. It is a founding member of the <a>IDEA League</a> and the <a>International Alliance of Research Universities (IARU)</a>. It is a member of <a>Top Industrial Managers for Europe</a> network.</p>
<p>The school was founded by the <a>Swiss Federal Government</a> in 1854 with the stated mission to educate engineers and scientists, serve as a national center of excellence in science and technology and provide a hub for interaction between the scientific community and industry.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|upright|left|<em>Polytechnikum</em> in 1865</a> <a>thumb|upright|left|ETH Z&#x00fc;rich Zentrum</a> ETH was founded in 1854 by the <a>Swiss Confederation</a> and opened its doors in 1855 as a polytechnic institute (<em>Eidgen&#x00f6;ssische Polytechnische Schule</em>). It comprised in the beginning six departments: <a>architecture</a>, <a>civil engineering</a>, <a>mechanical engineering</a>, <a>chemistry</a>, <a>forestry</a>, and a catch-all department for <a>mathematics</a>, natural sciences, literature, and social and <a>political science</a>s. It is locally still known as <em>Poly</em>, derived from the original name <em>Eidgen&#x00f6;ssisches Polytechnikum</em> &quot;Federal Polytechnic Institute&quot;.</p>
<p>ETH is a <em>federal</em> institute (i.e., under direct administration by the Swiss government), whereas the <a>University of Zurich</a> is a <em><a>cantonal</a></em> institution. The decision for a new federal university was heavily disputed at the time, because the liberals pressed for a &quot;federal university&quot;, while the conservative forces wanted all universities to remain under cantonal control, with the goal of giving liberal thoughts no refuge. In the beginning, both universities were co&ndash;located in the buildings of the University of Zurich.</p>
<p>In 1909, the course program of ETH was restructured to that of a real university, from its early, very schoolish agenda, and ETH was granted the right to award doctorates. In 1911, it was given its current name, <em>Eidgen&#x00f6;ssische Technische Hochschule</em>. In 1924, another reorganization structured the university in 12 departments. However, it now has 16 departments. <a>upright|thumb|right|Interior skylights in the main building</a></p>
<p>Since 1993 ETH Zurich, the EPFL, and four associated research institutes were joined and administered together as the &quot;<em>ETH Bereich</em>&quot;.</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>ETH is regularly ranked among the top universities in the world. Typically, popular <a>rankings</a> placed ETH as the best university in Switzerland and on the main European continent, among the top 3 European universities, and among the best 15 of the world (e.g., in 2010, rank 15 in both the Times and Shanghai ranking, see <a>Ranking Overview</a>).</p>
<p>Historically, ETH achieved its reputation particularly in the fields of <a>chemistry</a>, <a>mathematics</a> and <a>physics</a>. There are 21 <a>Nobel Laureate</a>s who are associated with ETH. The most recent Nobel Laureate is <a>Kurt W&#x00fc;thrich</a> who was awarded the <a>Nobel Prize</a> in chemistry in 2002. Albert Einstein is perhaps its most famous alumnus. Other distinguished alumni include <a>Har Gobind Khorana</a> and <a>John Von Neumann</a>.</p>
<p>In a comparison of Swiss universities by <a>swissUP Ranking</a> and a ranking published by <a>CHE</a> comparing the universities of German-speaking countries, ETH traditionally is ranked first in natural sciences, computer science and engineering sciences.</p>
<p>In the survey <a>CHE ExcellenceRanking</a> on the quality of Western European graduate school programmes in the fields biology, chemistry, physics and mathematics, ETH was assessed as one of the three institutions to have excellent graduate programmes in all considered fields, the other two being the <a>Imperial College London</a> and the <a>University of Cambridge</a>. To support its cutting edge research, ETH Zurich saw a budget of 1.3 billion CHF (approx. 1.2 billion USD) in the year 2009.</p>
<p>In 2010 the <a>QS World University Rankings</a> placed ETH Zurich at 18th overall in the world, and 1st in mainland Europe, while only four UK universities performed better than it. Globally it has moved up 2 places from joint 20th, since the 2009 <a>THE-QS World University Rankings</a> (in 2010 <a>Times Higher Education World University Rankings</a> and <a>QS World University Rankings</a> parted ways to produce separate rankings). In 2009 it ranked 10th in the world in  field of <strong>Engineering &amp; IT</strong> and 12th in <strong>Natural Sciences</strong>. </p>
<p>According to the 2010 <a>Academic Ranking of World Universities</a> (ARWU), the ETH is ranked 23rd in the world, the 4th best university in Europe, and 1st in Switzerland. It is also ranked 5th in the field of Chemistry and 9th in the broad subject field of Natural Sciences and Mathematics worldwide.</p>
<h2>Admission and education</h2>
<p> <a>thumb|left|200px|Students and locals in ETH front courtyard</a> ETH is not selective in its undergraduate admission procedures. Like every public university in Switzerland, ETH is obliged to grant admission to every Swiss citizen who took the <em><a>Matura</a></em>. It also grants entry to foreign students with certain qualifications, such as <a>A-Levels</a> with <a>GCSE</a>, but only in specific combinations. Most applicants from foreign countries are required to take either the <em>reduced entrance exam</em> or the <em>comprehensive entrance exam</em>; an applicant can be admitted to ETH even without any verifiable educational records by passing the <em>comprehensive entrance exam</em>.</p>
<p>There are no obligatory examinations during the first academic year which is divided into two semesters. However, the actual selection process takes place in the summer shortly after the second semester. Students have to pass the block examinations of courses of the first year, called the <em>Basispr&#x00fc;fung</em>. If the weighted average score is not sufficient, you are required to retake the entire <em>Basispr&#x00fc;fung</em> which usually means that you have to resit through the first year. More than 50% of the students fail the <em>Basispr&#x00fc;fung</em> on first try and many of them choose to drop out after the failure. The structure of examinations in higher academic years is similar to the <em>Basispr&#x00fc;fung</em> (Basis examination), but with a higher success rate. The regular time to reach graduation is six semesters for the <a>Bachelor of Science</a> degree and three further semesters for the <a>Master of Science</a> degree. The last semester is dedicated to writing a thesis.</p>
<p>Education at ETH tends to be theoretically oriented with a high amount of <a>mathematics</a> involved throughout the courses. The main language of teaching in undergraduate studies is German while English is lingua franca in Master's studies and graduate studies.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>thumb|320px|ETH H&#x00f6;nggerberg with the new HIT building</a> ETH Zurich has two campuses. The main building was constructed in the 1860s in the heart of the city, and when the university grew, it spread out into the surrounding quarters. Its <em>Zentrum</em> location consists thus of various buildings and institutions throughout Zurich, firmly integrating ETH in the city. The main building is right across the street from the University of Zurich.</p>
<p>Because this geographic situation substantially hindered the expansion of ETH, a new campus was built from 1964 to 1976 on the <em><a>H&#x00f6;nggerberg</a></em> in the outskirts of the city. The last major expansion project of this new campus was completed in 2003; since then, the <em>H&#x00f6;nggerberg</em> location houses the departments of <a>materials science</a>, <a>architecture</a>, <a>civil engineering</a>, <a>physics</a>, <a>biology</a>, and <a>chemistry</a>.</p>
<h3>Main building</h3>
<p><a>thumb|Main building as seen from <em>Polyterasse</em></a> The main building of ETH was built 1861 to 1864 under <a>Gustav Zeuner</a>; the architect, however, was <a>Gottfried Semper</a>, who was a professor of architecture at ETH at the time and one of the most important writers and theorists of the age.  Semper worked in a <a>neoclassical style</a> that was unique to him. It emphasized bold and clear massings with a detailing, such as the rusticated ground level and giant order above, that derived in part from the work of <a>Andrea Palladio</a> and <a>Donato Bramante</a>. During the construction of the University of Zurich, the south wing of the building was allocated to the University until its own new main building was constructed (1912 &ndash; 1914). At about the same time, Semper's ETH building was enlarged and also got its impressive <a>cupola</a>.</p>
<h3>Science City</h3>
<p>In the year of ETH's 150th anniversary, an extensive project called &quot;Science City&quot; for the H&#x00f6;nggerberg Campus has begun with the goal to transform the campus into an attractive district based on the principle of sustainability. <a>700px|center|thumb|ETH H&#x00f6;nggerberg from the south, looking at the five &quot;fingers&quot; of the HCI and behind the high HPP building.</a></p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<p>ETH students were found to be the busiest students of all institutions of higher education in Switzerland. The undergraduates' tight curriculum consists of as much as twice the number of lectures as comparable courses of other Swiss universities.</p>
<p>ETH has well over 100 student associations. Most notable is the VSETH (<em>Verband der Studierenden an der ETH</em>) which comprises all department associations. The associations regularly organize events with varying size and popularity. Events of the neighboring University of Zurich are well-attended by ETH students and vice versa. The VSETH organizes events of greater public attention, such as the <em>Polyball</em>, the <em>Polyparty</em> and the <em>Erstsemestrigenfest</em>, the first two housed in the main building of ETH. Sometimes, the annual <em>Erstsemestrigenfest</em> takes place at extraordinary locations, for example the <a>Zurich Airport</a>. All freshmen enjoy special treatment at that event.</p>
<p>The Academic Sports Association of Zurich (ASVZ) offers more than 80 sports. The biggest annual sports event is the <em>SOLA-Stafette</em> (SOLA relay race) which consists of 14 sections over a total distance of 120 kilometers. More than 760 teams participated in the 2009 edition.</p>
<h2>Traditions</h2>
<p>The annual Polyball is the most prestigious public event at ETH, with a long tradition since the 1880s. The end of November, the <em>Polyball</em> welcomes around 10,000 dancers, music-lovers and party animals in the extensively decorated main building of ETH. The <em>Polyball</em> is the biggest decorated ball in Europe.</p>
<p>The amicable rivalry between ETH and the neighbouring University of Zurich has been cultivated since 1951 (Uni-Poly). There has been an annual <a>rowing</a> match between teams from the two institutions on the river <a>Limmat</a>.</p>
<p>There are many regular symposia and conferences at ETH, most notably the annual <em>Wolfgang Pauli Lectures</em>, in honor of former ETH Professor <a>Wolfgang Pauli</a>. Distinct lecturers, among them 24 <a>Nobel Laureate</a>s, have held lectures of the various fields of <a>natural science</a>s at this conference since 1962.</p>
