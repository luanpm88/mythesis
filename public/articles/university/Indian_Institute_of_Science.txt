<p>The <strong>Indian Institute of Science</strong> (<strong>IISc</strong>) is a research institution of higher learning located in <a>Bangalore</a>, <a>India</a>. It was established in 1909. IISc is considered as the premier institute for scientific research and study in India, and is typically ranked higher than any other Indian university in world university rankings. According to a UNO survey, it was ranked 18 in the world.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>[[Image:Iisc-Founder.jpg|left|thumb|[[Jamshedji Tata|Jamsetji N. Tata]], founder]] After a chance meeting between <a>Jamsetji N. Tata</a> and <a>Swami Vivekananda</a> on a ship in 1893 where they discussed Tata's plan of bringing the steel industry to India, Tata wrote to Vivekananda five years later:&lt;ref&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Impressed by Vivekananda's views on science and leadership abilities, Tata wanted him to guide his campaign. Vivekananda endorsed the project with enthusiasm, and Tata, with the aim of advancing the scientific capabilities of the country, constituted a Provisional Committee to prepare a plan for setting up of an Institute of research and higher education. The committee presented a draft proposal to <a>Lord Curzon</a> on 31 December 1898. Subsequently, Sir <a>William Ramsay</a>, a Nobel Laureate, was called on to propose a suitable place for such an institution who suggested <a>Bangalore</a> as the best location.</p>

<p>The land and other facilities for the institution were pitched in from <a>Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV</a>, the <a>Maharaja</a> of <a>Mysore</a>, Government of India, and Tata himself. While the Maharaja donated 372 acres (1.5&nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of land free of cost, Tata gave several buildings and landed properties towards the creation of IISc.&lt;ref&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the Government of Karnataka gifted lands during the <a>Golden Jubilee</a> and <a>Platinum Jubilee</a> of the Institute making the current land holding of the Institute .</p>
<p>The constitution of the Institute was approved by the Viceroy <a>Lord Minto</a>, and the necessary Vesting Order was signed on 27 May 1909. Early in 1911, the Maharaja of Mysore laid the foundation stone of the Institute, and on 24 July, the first batch of students were admitted in the Departments of General and Applied Chemistry under <a>Norman Rudolf</a> and Electro-Technology under <a>Alferd Hay</a>. Within two months, the Department of Organic Chemistry was opened. With the establishment of the University Grants Commission in 1956, the Institute came under its purview as a deemed university.</p>
<p>At the time of the inception of IISc in 1909, <a>Morris Travers</a>, <a>William Ramsay</a>'s co-worker in the discovery of the noble gases, became its first Director. For Travers, this was a natural continuation of his work on the Institute, since he had played a role in its founding. The first Indian Director was the Nobel Laureate Sir <a>C. V. Raman</a>, and the current Director is <a>Padmanabhan Balaram</a>. <a>left|thumb|250px|IISc Main Building</a></p>
<p>The Institute was the first to introduce (i) Masters programs in engineering;  (ii) more recently, the Integrated Ph. D. Programs in Biological, Chemical, Physical and Mathematical Sciences for science graduates;  (iii) the new IISc Young Fellowship program for the first 20 rank holders at the +2 level; and (iv) IISc Young Engineering Fellowship program for merited III year B. E. / B. Tech. students.</p>
<h3>Campus</h3>
<p>The IISc campus is located in North Bangalore about 4 kilometers from the city's main railway station and bus stand on the way to <a>Yeshwantpur</a>. Bus routes 252, 256, 258, 273 and 276 serve this institute from the <a>Kempegowda Bus Station</a> (also known as Majestic) and it is also easily accessible by auto-rikshaws.</p>
<p>The campus houses more than 40 departments, six canteens (cafeterias), a gymkhana (gym), three dining messes (halls), one multicuisine family restaurant, nine men's and five women's hostels (dormitories), an air strip, a library, two shopping centers, a massage parlour, a beauty parlour and residence areas for faculties and other staff members.</p>
<p>The IISc campus harbors both exotic and indigenous plant species with about 110 species of woody plants, including quite a number of <a>Jackfruit</a> trees. &lt;ref&gt;<a>Flora At IISc Campus&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;</a>&lt;/ref&gt; The roads on the campus are named after the dominant avenue tree species. The campus was intended to be maintained with sufficient green cover and open areas.&lt;ref&gt;IISc (1992) <a>Landuse Masterplan</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The institute is an island of greenery within Bangalore and about twelve different species of snakes and endangered species like the <a>Gray Slender Loris</a> have been found in its campus. A Snake Rescue group is available on call to translocate and prevent the killing of snakes.</p>
<h3>Main building</h3>
<p>The architecture of the main building, which today houses the administration and the prestigious Faculty Hall, is in classical style, carried out in a grey handsome tower. In front of it stands the work of <a>Gilbert Bayes</a>, a noble monument erected in memory of J. N. Tata.</p>
<p>At its feet is an inscription which will serve to remind future generations of the generosity of Jamsetji Tata and the persistence with which he worked for the welfare of India. <a>right|thumb|Inscription</a></p>
<h3>Library</h3>
<p>The library was established in 1911 and it is one of the first three departments started in the Institute (the other two are Departments of General and Applied Chemistry and Electrotechnology). It is regarded as one of the best scientific and technical libraries in India. Apart from the main library, the Institute also has independent departmental libraries. The library moved in to the present premises in January 1965, built out of grants provided by University Grants Commission (UGC), in commemoration of the golden jubilee celebrations of the Institute in 1959. In 1995, the library was renamed as &quot;J. R. D. Tata Memorial Library&quot;. The National Board for Higher Mathematics (NBHM) has recognised this library as Regional Center for Mathematics for the south region and continued to award a special grant towards subscription of Journals in Mathematics.</p>
<p>The annual budget of the library is over Rs. 100 million  (almost US$ 2,500,000) of which subscription towards periodicals alone is about Rs. 90 million. The library currently receives over 1,734 periodical titles, of which 1381 are subscribed, while the remaining titles are received as gratis or on an exchange basis. About 600 titles are accessible through the library subscription. In addition, over 10,000 journals are accessible online, thanks to INDEST subscription. The total holdings of the library exceed 411,000 documents.</p>
<h3>Central computing facility</h3>
<p>The Computer Centre, established in 1970 as a central computing facility, became <a>Supercomputer Education and Research Centre</a> (SERC) in 1990 to provide state-of-the-art computing facility to the faculty and students of the Institute. SERC is created and fully funded by the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) to commemorate the platinum jubilee of the Institute.</p>
<p>SERC is the country's leading computing centre having the state-of-the art computing facilities, catering to the ever-increasing demands of high performance computing for scientific and engineering research. The supercomputing facility at SERC is a symbiosis of computing, network, graphics, and visualization and is conceived as a functionally distributed supercomputing environment housing state-of-the-art computing systems with sophisticated software packages and connected by a powerful high-speed network.</p>
<p>Apart from functioning as a central computing facility of IISc, the SERC is engaged in education and research programs in areas relating to supercomputer development and application. The Centre is also involved in several sponsored research projects in collaboration with several high-profile government and private agencies.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<h3>Organization</h3>
<p>Departments and centers in the Institute are broadly assigned to two categories: science and engineering. Two Deans, one each for Science and Engineering administer their respective category.</p>
<p>The faculty of science comprises three divisions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Division of Biological Sciences</li>
  <li>Division of Chemical Sciences</li>
  <li>Division of Mathematical &amp; Physical Sciences</li>
</ul>
<p>The engineering faculty are divided into two divisions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Division of Electrical Sciences</li>
  <li>Division of Mechanical Sciences</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these five divisions are administered by a divisional chairman. Each department or centre, under these divisions, is administered by a Chairman of the department or centre.</p>
<p>The following centers are directly under the director (without a divisional chairman):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Centre for Continuing Education</li>
  <li>Center for Sponsored Schemes and Projects</li>
  <li>Centre for Scientific &amp; Industrial Consultancy</li>
  <li>J. R. D. Tata Memorial Library</li>
  <li><a>National Centre for Science Information</a></li>
  <li><a>Supercomputer Education and Research Centre</a></li>
  <li>BioInformatics Centre</li>
  <li>Digital Information Services Centre</li>
  <li>Archives and Publication Cell</li>
</ul>
<h3>Degrees</h3>
<p>Degrees offered by the institute may be broadly classified into two categories: Degrees by Research (PhD, integrated PhD, and MS(Engg.)), and degrees by coursework (ME/MTech/MBA/MDes).</p>
<p>Research programs leading to M.Sc(Engg)/PhD degrees are the main thrust in many departments. The program has a limited amount of course work, essentially to prepare the student to carry out the research, but the main emphasis is on the thesis work.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.mecheng.iisc.ernet.in:8080/Programs.jsp</a>&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.ece.iisc.ernet.in/programmes.html</a>&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.serc.iisc.ernet.in/admissions/msc-phd.htm</a>&lt;/ref&gt; PhD and M.S(Engg) degrees each year, which is probably the largest for any institution in India. The annual intake of research students is approximately 250 with several candidates sponsored from educational institutions and industries.&lt;ref name=&quot;iisc.ernet.in&quot;&gt;<a>http://www.iisc.ernet.in/content_Science.html</a>&lt;/ref&gt; The research students constitute the largest group(50%) on the campus.&lt;ref name=&quot;iisc.ernet.in&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>The Integrated PhD program is designed to offer exciting opportunities to motivated and talented BSc/BE graduates with a keen sense of scientific inquiry for pursuing advanced research in frontier areas of Biological, Chemical and Physical Sciences, leading to the Ph. D. degree of the Institute.</p>
<p>Two-year programs leading to the ME/MTech/MSc(Engg) degree by course work are available in almost all engineering departments. One needs to score a very high percentile in GATE (<a>GATE</a>) to get admission into these programs. A unique feature of the ME/MTech/MS(Engg) programs at the institute is the credit system which allows students to tailor the courses to suit their aptitude, interest and research requirements. Most ME/MTech programs have a set of hard core courses specified as an essential requirement whereas students can take rest of the credits from many courses available in their parent or other departments and also do a dissertation work on the topic of their choice. These courses attract highly motivated accomplished students, in addition to several sponsored candidates from R&amp;D labs/industries and also from educational institutions under the Quality Improvement Programme (QIP).</p>
<p>The Department of Management Studies, one of the oldest management schools in the country (established in 1948), offers an MBA program exclusively for engineering graduates. The Center for Product Design and Manufacturing offers the Master of Design course. Started in 1996, the MDes program is a two-year, full-time graduate program.</p>
<h3>Rankings</h3>
<p> IISc has been ranked No. 1 in an article titled &quot;Ranking of Indian engineering and technological institutes for their research performance during 1999&#x2013;2008&quot; that was recently published in the journal <em>Current Science</em>.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.ias.ac.in/currsci/aug102009/304.pdf</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Worldwide, the institute falls among the top 400 according to the <a>Academic Ranking of World Universities</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;USUnivRankings_ARWU_W&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>Admissions</h3>
<p>Admission into IISc is highly competitive. Usually only the top 1 percent candidates qualifying the <a>GATE</a> examination are able to clear the cutoff for M. E. / M. Tech. admissions. Depending on the department and the number of students, the cutoff can get much higher. Admission to research programmes of the Institute, both PhD and M.Sc(Engg), is based on career analysis and (possibly) multiple rounds of technical interviews in the campus. Candidates are called for interview based on the entrance test of the Institute or <a>GATE</a> or any other test recognised by the Institute (which depends on the choice of department and specialization). For course oriented degrees -- <a>M. E.</a> and <a>M. Tech.</a> -- the admission is through the <a>GATE</a> examination conducted every year. For research oriented degree -- <a>M.Sc(Engg)</a> which is similar to MS with Thesis&#x2014;the admission is through the  CSIR-UGC NET for JRF; or UGC-NET for JRF; or DBT JRF or ICMR JRF; or JEST; or NBHM; or IISc Entrance Test; or <a>GATE</a>.&lt;ref name=MScEngg&gt;<a>http://www.iisc.ernet.in/admissions/</a>&lt;/ref&gt;  For Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.), which has a ceiling strength of only 25 seats across India, the admission is through the <a>Joint Management Entrance Test</a> (JMET) examination, conducted jointly by IISc and IITs. In addition, a group discussion and personal interview is also conducted to select the candidates.</p>
<h2>Academic/ Industrial Collaborations</h2>
<p>IISc collaborates  with various government organizations like <a>DRDO</a>,  <a>ISRO</a>, <a>Aeronautical Development Agency</a>, <a>National Aerospace Laboratories</a>, <a>CSIR</a>. IISc also works in collaboration with private industry/ research labs like <a>General Motors</a>, <a>Microsoft Research</a>, <a>IBM Research</a>. Few organisations have been incubated in campus viz <a>Mahindra Satyam</a>, <a>Cranes Software</a>.  IISc actively  promotes and supports  ventures by faculty, students and alumni. <a>Strand Life Sciences</a>,  Pico pita and  <a>Ittiam</a> are some success stories of this initiative.</p>
