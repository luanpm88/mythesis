<p> <strong>Aarhus University</strong> (in <a>Danish</a>, <strong>Aarhus Universitet</strong>), located in the city of <a>Aarhus</a>, <a>Denmark</a>, is Denmark's second oldest and second largest <a>university</a> (after the <a>University of Copenhagen</a>). </p>
<p>Aarhus University belongs to the international elite. In four prestigious ranking lists of the world's best universities, Aarhus University is placed in the top 100. AU is also listed as number 2 of universities in Scandinavian and Nordic countries. </p>
<p>The university was founded in 1928 and has an annual enrolment of more than 38,000 students.</p>
<p>Aarhus University housed Denmark's first professor of <a>sociology</a> (<a>Theodor Geiger</a>, from 1938&ndash;1952) and in 1997 professor <a>Jens Christian Skou</a> received the <a>Nobel Prize</a> for <a>Chemistry</a> for his discovery of the <a>sodium-potassium pump</a>. In 2010 <a>Dale T. Mortensen</a>, a Niels Bohr professor in economics at Aarhus University, received the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences together with his two colleagues <a>Peter Diamond</a> and <a>Christopher Pissarides</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Aarhus University was founded on 11 September 1928 as <em>Universitetsundervisningen i Jylland</em> (&quot;University Teaching in Jutland&quot;) with an enrolment of 64 students. Classrooms were rented from the Technical College and the teaching corps consisted of one professor of philosophy and four associate professors of Danish, English, German and French. Until then the University of Copenhagen was the only university in Denmark. In 1934 the faculty of humanities got state accreditation, state funding and the right to conduct exams. Until that time students had to go to Copenhagen to complete their studies. In 1936 a faculty of economics and law was created, in 1942 the faculty of divinity was created and the faculty of science was created in 1954.</p>
<p>The use of the name <em>Aarhus Universitet</em> began in 1933. Even though the name of the city, &#x00c5;rhus, has been spelled with <em><a>&#x00c5;</a></em> since the reform of Danish orthography in 1948, the name of the university insists on the old spelling with <em>Aa</em>. The official English translation of the name is <em>Aarhus University</em> (formerly, <em>The University of Aarhus</em>).</p>
<p>The entire campus was designed by the late C.F. M&#x00f8;ller, whose firm, C.F. M&#x00f8;ller Architects, has remained in charge of its further development, including its most recent additions: five new auditoria, completed in 2001.</p>
<h3>British air strike during World War II</h3>
<p><a>thumb|left|200px|Memorial in the main building for the ten killed in the 1944 air strike, and for two workers killed during construction in 1941.</a>During the <a>German occupation of Denmark</a> in the Second World War, the <a>Gestapo</a> had set up its regional headquarters in two dormitories on the campus. At the request of the Danish resistance movement, the <a>Royal Air Force</a> bombarded the campus on 31 October 1944, completely levelling the two dormitories to the ground. One of the aircraft, however, was hit by German guns and was forced to drop its bombs on the main building. The architect C. F. M&#x00f8;ller was present in the main building during the air strike but survived and was later dug free from the rubble. Ten workers were killed during the bombardment.</p>
<p>It is said that the first thing C. F. M&#x00f8;ller asked after his rescue was if &quot;the arches had been destroyed&quot;, referring to the masonry arches decorating the main building. He knew that if they had been destroyed there would not have been money for reconstruction. However the arches were not damaged and survive to this day.</p>
<p>The air strike on the University of Aarhus took place in a heavily populated area and the campus was surrounded by two hospitals. To avoid civilian casualties, the air strike only took place after several months of intense training on a model of the campus.</p>
<h2>Organisation and administration</h2>
<p>The university is governed by a board consisting of 13 members: 8 members recruited outside the university form the majority of the board, 2 members are appointed by the scientific staff, 1 member is appointed by the administrative staff, and 2 members are appointed by the university students.  The rector is appointed by the university board. The rector in turn appoints deans and deans appoint heads of departments. There is no faculty senate and faculty is not involved in the appointment of rector, deans, or department heads. Hence the university has no faculty governance.</p>
<h3>Faculties</h3>
<p>The university is organised into eight faculties: <a>thumb|right|300px|The state library on campus (Statsbiblioteket)</a></p>
<ol>
  <li>The Faculty of Humanities (<em>Det Humanistiske Fakultet</em>), which has offered courses since 1928.</li>
  <li>The Faculty of Health Sciences, consisting of the former Faculty of Medicine (which began courses in basic medical subjects in 1933) and the former Dental School (added to the Faculty of Medicine in 1992, when the name was changed to the Faculty of Health Sciences).</li>
  <li>The Faculty of Social Sciences, consisting of the former Faculty of Economics and Law (established in 1936) and of Political Science and Psychology.</li>
  <li>The Faculty of Theology, established in 1942. Courses in theology had been offered from 1932, being previously taught at the Faculty of Arts.</li>
  <li>The Faculty of Science, which was established in 1954 by moving Physics and Chemistry from the then Faculty of Medicine and Geography from the then Faculty of Arts. Mathematics was established as a new subject, followed by Biology and Geology.</li>
  <li>The Faculty of Agricultural Sciences, formerly Danmarks JordbrugsForskning (DJF), which was amalgamated with the university in 2007.</li>
  <li><a>Aarhus School of Business</a>, which was founded in 1939 and amalgamated with the university in 2007.</li>
  <li>The <a>National Environmental Research Institute (NERI)</a>, which was amalgamated with the university in 2007.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Enrolment</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|300px|Rear of the main building</a> As of 2007, the number of students is c. 35,000. Each year more than 900 international exchange students come to Aarhus University to study for one or two semesters..</p>
<h2>Student organisations</h2>
<p>The largest student organisations at Aarhus University are the <a>Student Union</a> (<em>Studenterr&#x00e5;det</em>) and <em>Studenterlauget</em>. The Student Union represents the main student body at Aarhus University while <em>Studenterlauget</em> represents the students at <a>Aarhus School of Business</a>. Both the Student Union and <em>Studenterlauget</em> are represented on the university board. The Student Union also arranges annual concerts and seminars, and publishes the student magazine <em>Delfinen</em> (The Dolphin). </p>
<p>There are political students organisations at the university, the largest of which include the Social-Democratic Students (<em>Frit Forum</em>), Conservative Students (<em>Konservative Studenter</em>), and <a>Liberal Students</a> (<em>Liberale Studerende</em>). The Conservative Students union publishes the student magazine <em>Critique</em>. The Liberal Students union publishes the leaflet Minerva.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|300px|University Park</a> The campus master plan competition was won in 1931 by the collaborative scheme of Danish architects, <a>Kay Fisker</a>, <a>C.F. M&#x00f8;ller</a>, and Poul Stegmann with landscape architect C. Th. S&#x00f8;rensen. The design hosts a wide variety of buildings over a large space, but each building is composed of the same yellow brick and roofing tile, giving the whole campus a unified look. Construction commenced in 1932 and has continued into the 21st century. It was one of the first Danish <a>functionalist</a> public buildings and has been included in the Ministry of Culture's canon of Danish architecture. C.F. M&#x00f8;ller and his company continued alone on the campus after 1942., and 63 in the world by THES- World University Ranking 2009.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The university is ranked number 63 in the 2009 <a>THE&#x2013;QS World University Rankings</a> (in 2010 <a>Times Higher Education World University Rankings</a> and <a>QS World University Rankings</a> parted ways to produce separate rankings) and listed as number 2 of universities in Nordic countries.

<h2>Cheminova controversy and academic freedom at AU</h2>
<p>Aarhus University is the owner of the chemical manufacturer Cheminova, who controversially has been selling the methyl parathion pesticide to Brazil farmers. </p>
<p>In 2009, senior researcher Mette Jensen emailed her colleagues at AU, asking whether they thought Cheminova should stop selling the controversial pesticides. For this, the university threatened her with dismissal.</p>
<p>The university's Pro-Vice-Chancellor S&#x00f8;ren E. Frandsen denies that the university had made any mistakes or threatened the freedom of speech and academic freedom of its staff.</p>
