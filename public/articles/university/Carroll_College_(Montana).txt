In addition to its football heritage, the 1931 football team was undefeated, untied, and unscored upon and finished the season as state champions. As per the &quot;Prospector&quot; (1956 and quoted)&quot;Their victims include Centerville Independents who fell 20-0, University of Montana dropping a 2-0 verdict, Western Montana humbled 83-0, Montana School of Mines who bowed 19-0, Inter-Mountain of Helena, who was run over 62-0, and Montana state college decisioned 6-0. Coach Bill Jones, who coached and played under the immortal Knute Rockne dedicated the final game to the Rock.&quot; Leading the Saints offense was North Platte, NE. native quarterback Don &quot;Cal&quot; Snyder (in 1935 Cal Snyder was also elected NIAA All-conference quarterback at Kearney State Teachers College NE, now called University Of Nebreska At Kearney).  The Fighting Saints were also the first collegiate coaching home for <a>John Gagliardi</a>, who is the winningest coach in all of college football (regardless of division.)  Gagliardi (pronounced Guh-LAR-dee), coached at Carroll for four years before moving to <a>St. John's University</a> in Minnesota, where he is in his fifty-seventh season.</p>
