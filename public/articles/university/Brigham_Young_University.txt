<p>  </p>
<p><strong>Brigham Young University</strong> (<strong>BYU</strong>), located in <a>Provo, Utah</a>, United States, is a <a>private</a>, <a>coeducation</a>al <a>research university</a> owned by <a>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a> (LDS or Mormon Church). It is the oldest existing institution within the LDS <a>Church Educational System</a>.  It is also America's largest religious university, and has the third-largest <a>private university</a> enrollment in the United States. Approximately 98% of the 34,000 students at BYU are members of the LDS Church; one-third of its American students come from within the state of <a>Utah</a>.</p>
<p>BYU students are required to follow an <a>honor code</a>, which mandates behavior in line with LDS teachings (e.g., <a>academic honesty</a>, adherence to <a>dress and grooming standards</a>, and abstinence from <a>extramarital sex</a> and from <a>the consumption of drugs and alcohol</a>). Approximately 97% of male BYU graduates have taken a two-year hiatus from their studies at some point to serve as <a>Mormon missionaries</a>, and 32% of BYU female graduates have been missionaries as well.</p>
<p>The university's primary focus is on <a>undergraduate education</a>, but it also has 68 <a>master's</a> and 25 <a>doctoral degree</a> programs, including a <a>Juris Doctor</a> program.  About 70% of student tuition is funded by LDS Church <a>tithing</a> funds, making tuition less expensive than at similar private universities.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p> [[File:BrighamYoung1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Brigham Young]], the school's namesake]]</p>
<h3>Early days</h3>
<p>Brigham Young University's origin can be traced back to 1862 when a man named <a>Warren Dusenberry</a> started a Provo school in a prominent adobe building called Cluff Hall, which was located in the northeast corner of 200 East and 200 North. On October 16, 1875, <a>Brigham Young</a>, then <a>President</a> of <a>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a>, personally purchased the Lewis Building after previously hinting that a school would be built in Draper, Utah in 1867. Hence, October 16, 1875 is commonly held as BYU's founding date. Said Young about his vision: &quot;I hope to see an Academy established in Provo... at which the children of the Latter-day Saints can receive a good education unmixed with the pernicious atheistic influences that are found in so many of the higher schools of the country.&quot; Classes commencing January 3, 1876. Warren Dusenberry served as interim principal of the school for several months until April 1876 when Brigham Young's choice for principal arrived&#x2014;a German immigrant named <a>Karl Maeser</a>. A series of odd managerial decisions by Cluff led to his demotion; however, in his last official act, he proposed to the Board that the Academy be named &quot;Brigham Young University&quot;. The suggestion received a large amount of opposition, many members of the Board saying that the school wasn't large enough to be a university, but the decision ultimately passed. One opponent to the decision, Anthon H. Lund, later said, &quot;I hope their head will grow big enough for their hat.&quot; (The BY High School class of 1907 was ultimately responsible for the <a>famous giant &quot;Y&quot;</a> that is to this day <a>embedded on a mountain</a> near campus. Brimhall also presided over the University during a brief crisis involving the theory of evolution. The religious nature of the school seemed at the time to collide with this scientific theory. Joseph F. Smith, President of the Church, settled the question for a time by asking that evolution not be taught at the school. A few have described the school at this time as nothing more than a &quot;religious seminary&quot;. However, many of its graduates at this time would go on to great success and renown in their fields. During his tenure, the student body increased six times, making BYU the largest private school at the time. The quality of the students also increased, leading to higher educational standards at the school. Finally, President Wilkinson reorganized the LDS church units on campus, with ten <a>stakes</a> and over 100 <a>wards</a> being added during his administration. <a>Jeffrey R. Holland</a> followed as President, encouraging a combination of educational excellence and religious faith at the university. He believed that one of the school's greatest strengths was its religious nature and that this should be taken advantage of rather than hidden. During his administration, the university added a campus in Jerusalem, now called the <a>BYU Jerusalem Center</a>. In 1989, Holland was replaced by <a>Rex E. Lee</a>. Lee was responsible for the Benson Science Building and the Museum of Art on campus. A cancer victim, Lee is memorialized annually at BYU during a cancer fundraiser called the Rex Lee Run.  Lee was replaced shortly before his death in 1996 by <a>Merrill J. Bateman</a>. Bateman was responsible for the building of 36 new buildings for the University both on and off campus, including the expansion of the Harold B. Lee Library from 1996-1999. He was also one of several key college leaders who brought about the creation of the <a>Mountain West Conference</a>, which BYU's athletics program joined&#x2014;BYU previously participating in the <a>Western Athletic Conference</a>. A <a>BYU satellite TV network</a> also opened in 2000 under his leadership. Bateman was also president during the <a>September 11th attacks</a> in 2001. The planes crashed on a Tuesday, mere hours before the weekly devotional normally held at BYU. Previous plans for the devotional were altered, as Bateman led the student body in a prayer for peace.  Bateman was followed by <a>Cecil O. Samuelson</a> in 2003, who is the current president.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<h3>Admissions and demographics</h3>
<p>BYU accepted 68% of the 10,409 people who applied for admission in the summer term and fall semester of 2009. The average ACT score and GPA for these admitted students was 28.2 and 3.8, respectively. In addition, BYU is ranked 26th in colleges with the most freshman <a>Merit Scholars</a>, with 88 in 2006.  In 2010, BYU outranked every university in the country including <a>Harvard University</a> for the percentage of accepted applicants that go on to enroll (78% vs. 76% for <a>Harvard</a>).  [[File:Harold B. Lee Library.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The [[Harold B. Lee Library]] is consistently ranked among the top ten in the nation, with a #1 ranking in 2004 by <em><a>The Princeton Review</a></em>.]] Students from every state in the U.S. and from many foreign countries attend BYU. (In the 2005-6 academic year, there were 2,396 foreign students, or 8% of enrollment.)</p>
<h3>Graduation honors</h3>
<p> Undergraduate students may qualify for graduation honors. <em><a>University Honors</a></em> is the highest distinction BYU awards its graduates. Administered by the <a>Honors Program</a>, the distinction requires students to complete an honors curriculum requirement, a Great Works requirement, an Advanced Languages requirement, a service requirement, an honors thesis requirement, a graduation portfolio that summarizes the student's honors experiences&#x2014;all while maintaining at least a 3.5 GPA. The university additionally recognizes <a>Phi Kappa Phi</a> graduation honors.</p>
<h3>Rankings</h3>
<p></p>
<p>For 2010, the <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></em> ranked BYU as #71 in the country overall. <em>The Princeton Review</em> has ranked BYU the best value for college in 2007, and its <a>library</a> is consistently ranked in the nation's top ten&#x2014;#1 in 2004 and #4 in 2007.  BYU is also ranked #19 in the <em>U.S. News and World Report's</em> &quot;Great Schools, Great Prices&quot; lineup, and #12 in lowest student-incurred debt. Due in part to the school's emphasis on undergraduate research, BYU is ranked #10 nationally for the number of students who go on to earn PhDs, #1 nationally for students who go on to dental school, #6 nationally for students who go on to law school, and #10 nationally for students who go on to medical school. BYU is designated as a research university with high research activity by the <a>Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching</a>.</p>
<p>In 2009, the university's <a>Marriott School of Management</a> received a #5 ranking by <em><a>BusinessWeek</a></em> for its undergraduate programs, and its MBA program was ranked by several sources: #22 ranking by <em>BusinessWeek</em>, and #29 by <em>U.S. News &amp; World Report</em>. Among regional schools the program was ranked #1 by <em><a>The Wall Street Journal's</a></em> most recent ranking (2007); and among business schools worldwide the MBA program was ranked #92 for 2009 by <em><a>Financial Times</a></em>. For 2009, the university's <a>School of Accountancy</a>, which is housed within the Marriott School, received two #3 rankings for its undergraduate program&#x2014;one by <em><a>Public Accounting Report</a></em> and the other by <em>U.S. News &amp; World Report</em>. The same two reporting agencies also ranked the school's <a>MAcc</a> program #3 and #8 in the nation, respectively.</p>
<h3>Notable research and awards</h3>
<p>[[File:TNRB Tanner Building.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Marriott School of Management]] has been ranked #1 regionally by the <em><a>Wall Street Journal</a></em> for its <a>MBA</a> program and #5 by <em><a>BusinessWeek</a></em> for its undergraduate programs.]] Scientists associated with BYU have created some notable inventions. <a>Philo T. Farnsworth</a>, inventor of the electronic television, received his education at BYU, and later returned to do fusion research, receiving an honorary degree from the university. <a>Harvey Fletcher</a>, also an alumnus of BYU, went on to carry out the now famous <a>oil-drop experiment</a> with <a>Robert Millikan</a>, and was later Founding Dean of the <a>BYU College of Engineering</a>. <a>H. Tracy Hall</a>, inventor of the man-made diamond, left General Electric in 1955 and became a full professor of chemistry and Director of Research at BYU. While there, he invented a new type of diamond press, the tetrahedral press.  The Department of <a>Computer Science</a> developed and currently maintains <a>phpLDAPadmin</a>, an award-winning <a>open source</a> project. In May 2008, research by economics professor Joseph Price regarding the effects of child birth order was featured on <em><a>Today</a></em>. In student achievements, BYU Ad Lab teams won both the 2007 and 2008 <a>L'Or&#x00e9;al</a> National Brandstorm Competition, and students developed the Magnetic Lasso algorithm found in <a>Adobe Photoshop</a>. In prestigious scholarships, BYU has produced 10 <a>Rhodes Scholars</a>, four <a>Gates Scholars</a> in the last six years, and in the last decade has claimed 41 <a>Fulbright scholars</a> and 3 <a>Jack Kent Cooke</a> scholars.</p>
<h3>International focus</h3>
<p>[[File:ESC Eyring Science Center.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The [[Eyring Science Center]] houses a <a>planetarium</a> and a <a>Foucault pendulum</a>.]] Over three quarters of the student body have some proficiency in a second language (numbering 107 languages in total).  This is partially due to the fact that 45% of the student body at BYU have been <a>missionaries</a> for <a>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a>, and many of them learned a foreign language as part of their mission assignment. During any given semester, about one-third of the student body is enrolled in foreign language classes, a rate nearly four times the national average. program being one example. The university was selected by the <a>United States Department of Education</a> as the location of the national Middle East Language Resource Center, making the school a hub for experts on that region. Nearly 2,000 students take advantage of these programs yearly. In 2001, the <a>Institute of International Education</a> ranked BYU as the number one university in the U.S. to offer students study abroad opportunities. The <a>BYU Jerusalem Center</a>, which was closed in 2000 due to student security concerns related to the <a>Second Intifada</a> and, more recently, the <a>2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict</a>, was reopened to students in the Winter 2007 semester.</p>
<p>A few special additions enhance the language-learning experience. For example, BYU's <a>International Cinema</a>, featuring films in several languages, is the largest and longest-running university-run foreign film program in the country. As already noted, BYU also offers an intensive foreign language living experience, the Foreign Language Student Residence.  This is an on-campus apartment complex where students commit to only speak their foreign language of choice while in their apartments. Each apartment has at least one native speaker to ensure correct language usage.</p>
<h3>Academic freedom issues</h3>
<p> [[File:MaeserBuilding.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Maeser Building]], built in 1911, houses <a>BYU's Honors Program</a>.]] In 1992, the university drafted a new Statement on Academic Freedom, specifying that limitations may be placed upon &quot;expression with students or in public that: (1) contradicts or opposes, rather than analyzes or discusses, fundamental Church doctrine or policy; (2) deliberately attacks or derides the Church or its general leaders; or (3) violates the <a>Honor Code</a> because the expression is dishonest, illegal, unchaste, profane, or unduly disrespectful of others.&quot; These restrictions have caused some controversy as several professors have been disciplined according to the new rule. The <a>American Association of University Professors</a> has claimed that &quot;infringements on academic freedom are distressingly common and that the climate for academic freedom is distressingly poor.&quot; The new rules have not affected BYU's accreditation, as the university's chosen accrediting body allows &quot;religious colleges and universities to place limitations on academic freedom so long as they publish those limitations candidly&quot;, according to associate academic vice president Jim Gordon. The <a>AAUP</a>'s concern was not with restrictions on the faculty member's religious expression but with a failure, as alleged by the faculty member and AAUP, that the restrictions had not been adequately specified in advance by BYU:</p>
<p>:The AAUP requires that any doctrinal limitations on academic freedom be laid out clearly in writing. We [AAUP] concluded that BYU had failed to do so adequately.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>Brigham Young University is a part of the <a>Church Educational System</a> of LDS Church. It is organized under a <a>Board of Trustees</a>, with the President of the Church as chairman. The President of BYU, currently <a>Cecil O. Samuelson</a>, works in cooperation with the board. Altogether, BYU has 194 bachelor's degree programs, 68 master's degree programs, 25 Ph.D. programs, and a <a>Juris Doctor</a> program. These degree programs are overseen by 11 colleges:</p>
<p>&lt;center&gt;  &lt;/center&gt;</p>
<p>BYU also manages some courses and majors through the <a>David M. Kennedy Center for International Studies</a> and &quot;miscellaneous&quot; college departments, including Undergraduate Education, Graduate Studies, Independent Study, Continuing Education, and the Honors Program. BYU's Winter semester ends earlier than most universities in April since there is no <a>Spring break</a>, thus allowing students to pursue internships and other summer activities earlier. A typical academic year is broken up into two semesters: Fall (September&#x2013;December) and Winter (January&#x2013;April), as well as two shorter terms during the summer months: Spring (May&#x2013;June) and Summer (July&#x2013;August).</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p> The main campus in <a>Provo, Utah</a>, <a>United States</a> sits on approximately  nestled at the base of the <a>Wasatch Mountains</a> and includes 295 buildings.  The buildings feature a wide variety of architectural styles, each building being built in the style of its time. Furthermore, views of the Wasatch Mountains, (including <a>Mount Timpanogos</a>) can be seen from the campus. has approximately 8&#x00bd; million items in its collections, contains  of shelving, and can seat 4,600 people.  The <a>Spencer W. Kimball Tower</a> is home to several of the university's departments and programs and is the tallest building in Provo, Utah. Furthermore, BYU's <a>Marriott Center</a>, used as a basketball arena, can seat over 22,000 and is one of the largest on-campus arenas in the nation.  Interestingly absent on the campus of this church owned university is a campus chapel. Notwithstanding, each Sunday LDS Church services for students are conducted on campus, but due to the large number of students atteding these services, nearly all of the buildings and possible meeting space on campus is utilized (in addition many students attend services off campus in LDS chapels in the surrounding communities).</p>
<h3>Museums</h3>
<p>[[File:MOA North entrance.JPG|thumb|right|[[Brigham Young University Museum of Art|Museum of Art]] north entrance]] The campus is home to several museums containing exhibits from many different fields of study. BYU's <a>Museum of Art</a>, for example, is one of the largest and most attended art museums in the Mountain West. This Museum aids in academic pursuits of students at BYU via research and study of the artworks in its collection. The Museum is also open to the general public and provides educational programming. <a>The Museum of Peoples and Cultures</a> is a museum of archaeology and ethnology. It focuses on native cultures and artifacts of the Great Basin, American Southwest, Mesoamerica, Peru, and Polynesia. Home to more than 40,000 artifacts and 50,000 photographs, it documents BYU's archaeological research. The Earth Science Museum was built in 1976 to display the many fossils found by BYU's Dr. James A. Jensen. It holds many artifacts from the <a>Jurassic Period</a> (210-140 million years ago), and is one the top five collections in the world of fossils from that time period. It has been featured in magazines, newspapers, and on television internationally. &lt;!-- 100 tons of plaster-covered bones are stored underneath BYU's football stadium. This doesn't really fit here, if we're talking about museums, but it is cool.--&gt; The museum receives about 25,000 visitors every year. The <a>Monte L. Bean Life Science Museum</a> was formed in 1978. It features several forms of plant and animal life on display and available for research by students and scholars.</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>The campus also houses several performing arts facilities. The de Jong Concert Hall seats 1282 people and is named for <a>Gerrit de Jong Jr.</a>  The Pardoe Theatre is named for T. Earl and Kathryn Pardoe. Students use its stage in a variety of theatre experiments, as well as for Pardoe Series performances. It seats 500 people, and has quite a large stage with a <a>proscenium</a> opening of 19 by . The Margetts Theatre was named for Philip N. Margetts, a prominent Utah theatre figure. A smaller, <a>black box theater</a>, it allows a variety of seating and staging formats. It seats 125, and measures 30 by . Helaman Halls is a seven building (seventh added in the summer of 2010), dormitory style living area. Residents share a room (larger than Heritage Halls) with one other resident, but do not have their own kitchen and use shared bathrooms. Residents are required to have a meal plan, and eat at the newly remodeled Commons at the Cannon Center.</p>
<p>Wyview Park was originally built for families in 1996, but this changed in 2006 when the complex began housing single students in order to counteract loss of singles' housing in other areas. Wyview Park has 30 buildings that offer apartment-style living for students, along with the option for shared or single rooms.</p>
<p>The Foreign Language Student Residence complex has twenty-five apartments where students speak exclusively in a selected foreign language. The immersion experience is available in nine languages, and students are accompanied by a native resident throughout the year to enhance the experience.</p>
<p>Married students can house in Wymount Terrace, which contains a total of 462 apartments in 24 buildings.</p>
<p>Branches of the <a>BYU Creamery</a> provide basic food and general grocery products for students living in Heritage Halls, Helaman, Wymount, Wyview, and the FLSR. Helaman Halls is also served by a central cafeteria called the Cannon Center. The creamery, begun in 1949, has become a BYU tradition and is also frequented by visitors to the university and members of the community. It was the first on-campus full-service grocery store in the country.</p>
<h3>Sustainability</h3>
<p>BYU has designated energy conservation, products and materials, recycling, site planning and building design, student involvement, transportation, water conservation, and zero waste events as top priority categories in which to further its efforts to be an environmentally sustainable campus.  The university has stated that &quot;we have a responsibility to be wise stewards of the earth and its resources.&quot;  BYU is working to increase the energy efficiency of its buildings by installing various speed drives on all pumps and fans, replacing incandescent lighting with fluorescent lighting, retrofitting campus buildings with low-E reflective glass, and upgraded roof insulation to prevent heat loss. The student groups BYU Recycles, Eco-Response, and BYU Earth educate students, faculty, staff, and administrators about how the campus can decrease its environmental impact.  BYU Recycles spearheaded the recent campaign to begin recycling plastics, which the university did after a year of student campaigning.</p>
<h2>Performing arts</h2>
<p>[[File:BYUclarillon.jpg|right|thumb|The [[BYU Centennial Carillon]] stands at the north end of campus.]]</p>
<h3>Dance</h3>
<p>The <a>BYU Ballroom Dance Company</a> is known as one of the best formation ballroom dance teams in the world, having won the U.S. National Formation Dance Championship every year since 1982.  BYU's Ballroom dance team has won first place in Latin or Standard (or both) many times  when they have competed at the <a>Blackpool Dance Festival</a>, they were the first U.S. team to win the formation championships at the famed British Championships in Blackpool England in 1972 .  The NDCA National <a>DanceSport</a> championships have been held at BYU for several years, and BYU holds dozens of ballroom dance classes each semester and is consequently the largest collegiate ballroom dance program in the world.   [[File:BYU Concert Choir with Poppies.jpg|thumb|left|350px|The [[BYU Choirs|Concert Choir]] in performance]] BYU also has a strong emphasis on <a>jazz</a> music with the premiere performing group <em>Synthesis</em> leading the way. <em>Synthesis</em> has toured in over 30 countries and performed at some of the biggest <a>jazz festival</a>s in the world, namely <a>Montreux</a> (Switzerland), <a>Pori</a> (Finland), <a>Copenhagen</a> (Denmark), <a>Umbria</a> (Italy), <a>IAJE</a> (International Association of Jazz Educators) and many others. <em>Synthesis</em> also performed at the <a>2000 World Expo</a> in <a>Hannover, Germany</a>. Many of <em>Synthesis<strong> alumni have gone on to perform and record nationally and internationally as well as teach at prestigious <a>universities</a> nationwide. BYU offers degree programs in <a>Music</a>, <a>Music Education</a>, Music Performance, Jazz Studies and many more. </strong></em></p>
<p>BYU's Wind Symphony and Chamber Orchestra have toured many countries including <a>Denmark</a>, <a>Hong Kong</a>, <a>Russia</a>, the <a>British Isles</a>, and <a>Central Europe</a>.  The Symphonic Band is also an <a>ensemble</a> dedicated to developing the musician, but with a less strenuous focus on <a>performance</a>.  Additionally, BYU has a <a>marching band</a> program called the Cougar Marching Band.</p>
<p>BYU has a choral program with over 500 members.  The four BYU auditioned <a>choirs</a> include the 40-member <a>BYU Singers</a>, the 90-member <a>BYU Concert Choir</a>, the 200-member <a>BYU Men's Chorus</a> (the largest male collegiate choir in the U.S.), and the 190-member <a>BYU Women's Chorus</a>. Both the BYU Men's Chorus and BYU Singers have toured across the <a>United States</a> and around the globe. Each of the four groups has recorded several times under BYU's label <em><a>Tantara Records</a></em>.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|The school's first football team won the regional championship in 1896.</a> BYU has Athletics teams in a number of different sports ranging from Men's volleyball to Women's rugby. They play mainly in the <a>Mountain West Conference</a> since its inception in 1999. Prior to that time BYU teams competed in the <a>Western Athletic Conference</a>. All teams are named the &quot;Cougars&quot;, and <a>Cosmo the Cougar</a> has been the school's mascot since 1953. The school's fight song is the <a>Cougar Fight Song</a>. Because many of its players serve on full time missions for two years, BYU's athletes are often older on average than other school's players. The NCAA allows students to serve missions for two years without subtracting that time from their eligibility period. This has caused minor controversy, but is largely recognized as not lending the school any significant advantage, since players receive no athletic and little physical training during their missions. BYU has also received attention from sports networks for refusal to play games on Sunday, as well as expelling players due to honor code violations.  BYU football will start the 2011 college football season as an independent. Other sports will leave the MWC and compete in the <a>West Coast Conference</a>. Swimming and diving will join the Men's Volleyball Program in the <a>Mountain Pacific Sports Federation</a>. Softball and track and field are still awaiting news on where they'll compete.</p>
<h3>Football</h3>
<p>[[File:09-18-04k.jpg|thumb|left|[[LaVell Edwards Stadium]], home to <a>BYU Cougars football</a>]]  The Brigham Young University Cougars football program competes at the <a>NCAA</a> <a>Division I FBS</a> (formerly I-A) level. Their first coach was Benjamin Call. BYU was a founding member of the <a>Western Athletic Conference</a>, and in 1999 joined the new <a>Mountain West Conference</a>. BYU has developed into a national powerhouse in college football and has become known as a &quot;quarterback-factory&quot; for producing several successful quarterbacks. BYU alumni who have excelled in the <a>NFL</a> include <a>Jim McMahon</a>, <a>Steve Young</a>, <a>Gifford Nielsen</a>, <a>Bart Oates</a>, <a>Chad Lewis</a>, <a>Vai Sikahema</a> and <a>Todd Christensen</a>. Other notable alumni include <a>John Beck</a>, <a>Max Hall</a>, <a>Marc Wilson</a>, <a>Brett Kiesel</a>, <a>Rob Morris</a>, <a>John Tait</a>, <a>Bryan Kehl</a>, <a>Itula Mili</a>, <a>Ty Detmer</a>, <a>Robbie Bosco</a>, <a>John Denney</a>, <a>Ryan Denney</a>, <a>Chris Hoke</a>, <a>Reno Mahe</a>, <a>Austin Collie</a>, <a>Gordon Hudson</a>, <a>Brady Poppinga</a>, <a>Kelly Poppinga</a>, and <a>Doak Walker Award</a> winner <a>Luke Staley</a>. BYU also produced some of the greatest NFL coaches, including <a>Mike Holmgren</a>, <a>Brian Billick</a>, and <a>Andy Reid</a>, who all coached at BYU under <a>LaVell Edwards</a>, former head coach who is credited with engineering BYU's pass-oriented offensive style. <a>LSU</a> and NFL offensive coordinator <a>Gary Crowton</a> was head coach previously at BYU, and <a>University of Washington</a> head coach <a>Steve Sarkisian</a> was BYU's quarterback in 1995 and 1996.</p>
<p>In 1984, the team went undefeated and was voted the National Champions by the AP and UPI. In 1990, BYU quarterback <a>Ty Detmer</a> won the <a>Heisman Trophy</a>. BYU also holds the NCAA record for most consecutive games without being shutout, with 361 games over 28 years. As of the <a>2007 season</a> the team has won 22 conference championships since 1974 and have played in 26 bowl games. In the 2006-2007 season, the Cougars became nationally ranked for the first time since 1994 and won the Mountain West Conference regular season championship outright.</p>
<h3>Other sports</h3>
<p>BYU's Men's Volleyball has won the <a>NCAA National Championship</a> three times (1999, 2001, and 2004) and was the <a>Mountain Pacific Sports Federation</a> champion four times (1999, 2001, 2003 and 2004). The Women's Volleyball team is also consistently nationally ranked and in 2007 reached the Elite Eight before losing to eventual national champion <a>Penn State</a>. <a>BYU Men's Lacrosse</a> competes in the Men's College Lacrosse Association (MCLA) and is consistently ranked in the top 5 in the nation, having won the USL-MDIA (now MCLA) national championship in 1997, 2000, and 2007.  The team is a member of the RMLC and plays a national schedule. BYU is also a major force in American collegiate <a>rugby union</a> (known as rugby), with several students and alumni providing players to the <a>United States national rugby union team</a>, the Eagles. BYU's Rugby team was the national runner-up in 2006, 2007, and 2008, and in 2009 the school won its first National Rugby Championship by defeating the <a>University of California</a> in the final. The BYU women's cross-country team won National Championships in 1997, 1999, 2001, and 2002. <a>BYU's men's soccer club</a> participates as a university-owned franchise in the <a>United Soccer Leagues</a>' <a>Premier Development League</a>. The women's soccer team has appeared in the NCAA tournament 9 times, reaching as far as the Elite Eight in 2003 before losing to UConn. BYU's racquetball team also recently placed third at the 2008 USA Racquetball National Intercollegiate Championships, and BYU Golf won the 1981 NCAA Championship. BYU is considered a national powerhouse in Men's and Women Cross Country and Track and Field. The programs are consistently ranked, cracking the Top Ten on a regular basis. The 1970 Men's Track and Field Team tied with Oregon and Kansas to win the National Championship. Two BYU runners have won Individual Cross Country National Champions; Ed Eyestone in 1985 and Josh Rohatinsky in 2006. <a>Ice hockey</a> has been a part of BYU for many years, but at the beginning of the 2007/2008 season, the Provo IceCats, a club team composed of Brigham Young students which had been around since 1994, finally gained recognition as an official sport at BYU. Upon being officially recognized, the Cougar hockey team began proudly representing their school by wearing the BYU logo on their uniforms, and gaining full access to university facilities. Although the team is officially recognized and sponsored by the university, it will continue to be funded by donors and private individuals.  The Cougar ice hockey team now competes in the Division II Western Conference of the <a>American Collegiate Hockey Association</a> (ACHA).</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<p></p>
<h3>LDS atmosphere</h3>
<p> According to the Brigham Young University mission statement, &quot;The mission of [BYU] is to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and <a>eternal life</a>.&quot; BYU is thus considered by its leaders to be at heart a religious institution, wherein, ideally, religious and secular education are interwoven in a way that encourages the highest standards in both areas. This weaving of the secular and the religious aspects of a religious university goes back as far as Brigham Young himself, who told Karl G. Maeser when the Church purchased the school: &quot;I want you to remember that you ought not to teach even the alphabet or the multiplication tables without the <a>Spirit of God</a>.&quot;</p>
<p>BYU is also popularly considered by some Latter-day Saints, as well as some university and Church leaders to be &quot;The Lord's University&quot;. This phrase is used in reference to the school's perceived mission as an &quot;ambassador&quot; to the world for the LDS Church and thus, for <a>Jesus Christ</a>. In the past, some students and faculty have expressed dissatisfaction with this nickname, as it sometimes gives students the idea that university authorities are always divinely inspired and never to be contradicted. Leaders of the school, however, acknowledge that the nickname represents more a goal that the university strives for, and not its current state of being. Leaders encourage students and faculty to help fulfill the goal by following the teachings of their religion, adhering to the school's honor code, and serving others with the knowledge they gain while attending.</p>
<p>BYU mandates that its students who are members of <a>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a> be religiously active. Both LDS and Non-LDS students are required to provide an endorsement from an ecclesiastic leader with their application for admittance. Over 900 rooms on BYU campus are used for the purposes of <a>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a> congregations.  More than 150 congregations meet on BYU campus each Sunday. &quot;BYU's campus becomes one of the busiest and largest centers of worship in the world&quot; with about 24,000 persons attending church services on campus.</p>
<h3>Honor code</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>All students and faculty, regardless of religion, are required to agree to adhere to an <a>honor code</a>. Early forms of the BYU Honor Code are found as far back as the days of the Brigham Young Academy and early school President Karl G. Maeser. Maeser created the &quot;Domestic Organization&quot;, which was a group of teachers who would visit students at their homes to see that they were following the schools moral rules prohibiting obscenity, profanity, smoking, and alcohol consumption. The Honor Code itself was not created until about 1940, and was used mainly for cases of cheating and <a>academic dishonesty</a>. President Wilkinson expanded the Honor Code in 1957 to include other school standards. This led to what the Honor Code represents today: rules regarding chastity, dress, grooming, drugs, and alcohol. A signed commitment to live the honor code is part of the application process, and must be adhered by all students, faculty, and staff. Students and faculty found in violation of standards are either warned or called to meet with representatives of the Honor Council. In rare cases, students and faculty can be expelled from the school or lose tenure.  Both LDS and non-LDS students are required to meet annually with a Church leader to receive an ecclesiastical endorsement for both acceptance and continuance. Various <a>LGBT</a> advocacy groups have protested the honor code and criticized it as being <a>anti-gay</a>.</p>
<h3>Culture and activities</h3>
<p>[[File:Gordon B. Hinckley Alumni and Visitors Center.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Gordon B. Hinckley Alumni and Visitors Center]]]] BYU's social and cultural atmosphere is unique.  The high rate of enrollment at the university by members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints results in an amplification of LDS cultural norms; BYU was ranked by <em>The Princeton Review</em> in 2008 as 14th in the nation for having the happiest students and highest quality of life. However, the quirkiness and sometimes &quot;too nice&quot; culture is often caricatured, for example, in terms of marrying early and being very conservative.</p>
<p>One of the characteristics of BYU most often pointed out is its reputation for emphasizing a <a>&quot;marriage culture.&quot;</a>   Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints highly value marriage and family, as well as marriage within the faith. Approximately 51% of the graduates in BYU's class of 2005 were married. This is compared to a national marriage average among college graduates of 11%.</p>
<p>Many on-campus student activities are organized by <a>BYUSA</a>, the university's official student association.</p>
