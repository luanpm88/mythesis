<h2>History</h2>
<p> The <a>North Carolina General Assembly</a> founded NC State on March 7, 1887 as a <a>land-grant college</a> under the name &quot;North Carolina College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts.&quot; As a land-grant college, NC State would provide a liberal and practical education while focusing on military tactics, agriculture and the mechanical arts without excluding <a>classical studies</a>. Since its founding, the university has maintained these objectives while building on them. The 1970s saw enrollment surpass 19,000 and the addition of the School of Humanities and Social Sciences. NC State celebrated its centennial in 1987 and reorganized its internal structure renaming all its schools to colleges (e.g. School of Engineering to the <a>College of Engineering</a>). Also in this year, it gained  of land that would later become the Centennial Campus. During the next decade and a half and continuing today, NC State has focused on developing its new Centennial Campus. Over $620 million has been invested in facilities and infrastructure at the new campus with  of space being constructed. There are also 61 private and government agency partners located on Centennial Campus.</p>
<p>Currently, NC State has almost 8,000 employees, over 31,000 students, a $1.01&nbsp;billion annual budget, and a $535&nbsp;million endowment. It is the largest university in the state and one of the anchors of North Carolina's <a>Research Triangle</a>, together with <a>Duke University</a> and the <a>University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</a>.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<h3>Main</h3>
<p> <a>thumb|left|Holladay Hall, the first building built on NC State's campus in 1889, now houses the Chancellor's Office.</a> NC State's Main Campus has three sub-campuses: North Campus, Central Campus, and South Campus. North Campus is the oldest part of NC State and is home to most academic departments and a few residence halls. Central Campus is primarily composed of residence halls, cafeterias, gymnasiums and student support facilities. Finally, Greek Court, the McKimmon Conference and Training Center, and student park-and-ride areas are found on South Campus. North and Central Campus are separated by the <a>North Carolina Railroad</a>. Pedestrian <a>tunnel</a>s allow students to commute between campuses. Central and South Campuses are separated by Western Boulevard, a major downtown artery. University Housing divides Main Campus into West, Central, and East Campus for residence hall purposes. West and Central campuses are divided by Dan Allen Drive, while Central and East are divided by Morill Drive and <a>Reynolds Coliseum</a>.</p>
<p>[[Image:Pulstar2.jpg|thumb|right|175px|NC State's [[Pulstar (nuclear reactor)|PULSTAR]] Reactor is a 1 MW pool-type <a>nuclear</a> <a>research reactor</a>.]]Architecturally, Main Campus is known for its distinctive red <a>brick</a> buildings. Because of oversupply, odd brick statues dot the landscape, the <a>University Plaza</a>, colloquially named &quot;The Brickyard&quot;, in Central Campus is nicknamed for its paving material, and most sidewalks are also made from brick. The Brickyard and sidewalks also sporadically contain white brick mosaics and other patterns.</p>
<p>The <a>Memorial Bell Tower</a>, located in the Northeast corner of North Campus, serves as the signature of NC State and appears in the NC State Official Seal. It was constructed as a monument to alumni killed in <a>World War I</a>. The granite tower, completed in 1937, is 115&nbsp;<a>feet</a> (35 m) tall. As a tradition, the Bell Tower is lit in red at night immediately following athletic victories and certain academic achievements.  The Bell Tower, however, does not actually have a bell; The carillon system that can be heard ringing from the bell tower is actually housed in nearby Holladay Hall.</p>
<p>The <a>Court of North Carolina</a>, just West of the Memorial Bell Tower, is surrounded by the 1911 Building; the College of Humanities and Social Sciences in Tompkins, Caldwell, Winston Halls and The College of Education in Poe Hall; Page Hall, home to College of Engineering offices; and Leazar Hall, former location of the Computer Science Teaching Labs. It was once home to 100 trees (one for every <a>county</a> in <a>North Carolina</a>), but damage caused by <a>Hurricane Fran</a> in 1996 reduced the number significantly, including the destruction of a particularly old and large tree which was some  in diameter. Some replanting has occurred, but the Court's former appearance is far from being restored. <a>thumb|160px|left|Completed in 1937, the <strong>Memorial Bell Tower</strong> was built to honor thirty-three NC State alumni who died in World War I. It stands  tall.</a> Southwest of the Court of North Carolina is another landmark, the <a>Free Expression Tunnel</a>. The Tunnel functions as one of three pedestrian tunnels underneath the railroad tracks separating North Campus and Central Campus. This particular tunnel is the site of sanctioned <a>graffiti</a>; anyone may paint there, and it is often the place for political statements, personal messages, and art.</p>
<h3>Centennial</h3>
<p> NC State's main campus is augmented by the  mixed-use Centennial Campus. Located  south of the Memorial Bell Tower, this campus houses university, corporate, and government research, in addition to classrooms and non-student residences. The College of Textiles has been based on this campus since 1991.  Beginning in 2002, the College of Engineering began to relocate to Centennial Campus.  Currently, six of the nine College of Engineering departments are housed in three Engineering Buildings in an area known as the Engineering Oval.  The offices of <a>Red Hat</a>, <a>ABB</a>, and the <a>National Weather Service</a> are also on the Centennial Campus, as well as <a>Centennial Campus Middle School</a>.</p>
<h3>Centennial Biomedical Campus</h3>
<p>The <a>North Carolina State University Centennial Biomedical Campus</a> is located  west of the Memorial Bell Tower. The campus is anchored by <a>North Carolina State University College of Veterinary Medicine</a>--NC State's professional college and North Carolina's only <a>veterinary medicine</a> program. The  campus consists of 20 buildings including the  CVM Research Building where biomedical investigations in genomic sciences; vaccine development; cancer immuno-therapy; emerging and infectious zoonotic diseases; and diseases of the lung, respiratory track, skin, and digestive system are undertaken. The Center for Comparative Medicine and Translational Research, the Veterinary Teaching Hospital with its clinical research and clinical trials, and the Teaching Animal Unit (TAU), which is a working farm, are also campus elements. The Randall B. Terry, Jr. Companion Animal Veterinary Medical Center will more than double the size of the current hospital when completed in late 2010-early 2011.</p>
<p><a>J. C. Raulston Arboretum</a> is an  <a>arboretum</a> and <a>botanical garden</a> operated by NC State, and located just south of West Campus. It is open daily without charge.</p>
<h3>Stadiums</h3>
<p>The stadium property is  northwest of the Memorial Bell Tower. Both <a>Carter-Finley Stadium</a> and the <a>RBC Center</a> are located there. Aside from the two stadiums, the property is mainly open space used for event parking. The property borders the <a>North Carolina State Fair</a> to the North and hosts <a>tailgating parties</a> before NC State <a>football</a> games.</p>
<h3>Sustainability</h3>
<p>In March 2008, NC State launched the University Sustainability Office to address environmental concerns on campus and includes a Director of Sustainability, a Sustainability Outreach Coordinator, a Sustainability Program Coordinator, and a Sustainability Student intern.</pre>
<p>NC State has established a commitment to reduce its annual energy consumption per square foot by at least 4% over a 10 year period. In addition, the university has surpassed the Executive Order 156 goal of diverting 40 percent of their solid waste stream from the landfill through a variety of campus reuse and recycling programs. NC State incorporates locally grown, organic, and free range foods into dining service meals at several events such as Earth Week&#x2019;s EarthFest and the annual All Carolinas Meal with foods local to the Carolinas. Examinations of the campus&#x2019; sustainability practices by the Sustainable Endowments Institute resulted in a &#x201c;C+&#x201d; grade for NC State on the College Sustainability Report Card 2009.</pre>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>&lt;div style=&quot;float:right&quot;&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;</p>
<h3>Structure</h3>
<p> NC State is one of 16 campuses that constitute the <a>University of North Carolina</a> system. Each campus has a high degree of independence, but each submits to the policies of the UNC system Board of Governors. The 32 voting members of the Board of Governors are elected by the North Carolina General Assembly for four-year terms. President <a>Erskine Bowles</a> heads the system.</pre>
<p>The Board of Trustees of NC State has thirteen members and sets all policies for the University. The UNC system Board of Governors elects eight of the trustees and the Governor of North Carolina appoints four. The student body president serves on the Board of Trustees as a voting member. The UNC system also elects the Chancellor of NC State, currently Randy Woodson.</pre>
<p>The Board of Trustees administers NC State's eleven academic <a>colleges</a>. Each college grants its own degrees with the exception of the First Year College which provides incoming freshmen the opportunity to experience several disciplines before selecting a major. The <a>College of Agriculture and Life Sciences</a> is the only college to offer <a>associate's degrees</a> and the <a>College of Veterinary Medicine</a> does not grant undergraduate degrees. Each college is composed of numerous <a>departments</a> that focus on a particular discipline or degree program, for example <a>English</a>, <a>Computer Science</a>, or <a>Accounting</a>. There are a total of 66 departments administered by all eleven NC State colleges.</p>
<p>In total, NC State offers nine <a>associate's degree</a>s in agriculture, <a>bachelor's degree</a>s in 102 areas of study, <a>master's degree</a>s in 108 areas and <a>doctorate degree</a>s in 60 areas. NC State is known for its programs in <a>agriculture</a>, <a>engineering</a>, <a>veterinary medicine</a>, and <a>science</a>. The <a>textile</a> and <a>paper engineering</a> programs are notable, given the uniqueness of the subject area.</pre>
<h3>Admission</h3>
<p>Considered a <em>more selective</em> university, NC State accepts more than half of those who apply for undergraduate admissions. For the class of 2012, 59% of about 18,000 applicants who applied for admission to N.C. State were accepted. For the Class of 2013, over 19,000 applications were received and only 55% were accepted. This was the largest application pool ever at N.C. State and the highest among the UNC system. This class includes about 160 valedictorians and salutatorians. About 48% were ranked in the top 10% of their class and 83% ranked in the top 20%. The mean GPA for freshman entering fall of 2010 is 4.23.</p>
<p>Transfer admission is also very competitive. According to college board, 3,868 students apply for one of the 1,389 places in the transfer class at NCSU. The mean transfer GPA was a 3.30 fall of 2008. For the fall of 2010 almost 3,900 students applied for about 1,100 spaces.</pre>
<p>NC State requires undergraduate admission candidates to choose a preferred college of study. After determining that an applicant meets the overall university requirements, the individual college must also agree to accept the student. Because of this process, some colleges have significantly higher admission requirements than others. For example, the College of Engineering has higher admission standards than the College of Natural Resources. The College of Design has an exceptionally difficult admissions process, including a full portfolio review and, for some majors, an in-person interview. Every year, the College of Design admits only 130 students. In addition, students might have a difficult time transferring between colleges. Transferring to the College of Design from another college could be difficult because of lack of design experience. The College of Veterinary Medicine, NC State's professional school, requires a four-year undergraduate degree with course work in selected areas.</pre>
<p>The Graduate School reviews all <a>postgraduate</a> education applications. For fall 2005, 7,206 prospective students applied to the Graduate School; 2836 (39.4%) were admitted. Of these, 1,755 (61.9%) enrolled. Total fall 2005 graduate enrollment 6,128.</pre>
<h3>Library</h3>
<p>The library system at NC State, ranked 27th out of 113 North American research libraries, includes 3.4 million volumes and 54 thousand journal subscriptions (as of 2005). The library system has an annual budget of over $20 million and consists of eight libraries. The largest library, <a>D. H. Hill Library</a>, located on <a>Main Campus</a> is over eleven stories tall and covers over 119 thousand square feet (11 thousand square meters). NC State, as a member of the <a>Triangle Research Libraries Network</a> (TRLN), has interlibrary loan services with <a>Duke University</a>, the <a>University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</a>, and <a>North Carolina Central University</a>.</p>

NC State was a founding member of the [[Southern Conference]] and is also one of the four teams on [[Tobacco Road]].</pre>
<p>The primary logo for NC State athletics is a red block 'S' with an inscribed 'N' and 'C'. The block S has been in use since 1890 but has seen many alterations through the years. It became the sole logo for all NC State athletic teams in 2000 and was modernized to its current design in 2006.</p>
<p>NC State athletic teams are nicknamed the 'Wolfpack' (most women's teams are also called the &quot;Wolfpack,&quot; except for the women's basketball team who go by the &quot;Wolfpack Women&quot;). The name was adopted in 1922 when a disgruntled fan described the behavior of the student body at athletic events as being &quot;like a wolf pack.&quot; Prior to the adoption of the current nickname, NC State athletic teams went by such names as the Aggies, the Techs, and the Red Terrors. Since the 1960s the Wolfpack has been represented at athletic events by its mascots, Mr. and Ms. Wuf. In print, the 'Strutting Wolf' is used and is known by the name 'Tuffy.'</p>
