<p></p>
<p>The <strong>University of Southampton</strong> is a &quot;red-brick&quot; British public university located in the city of <a>Southampton</a>, <a>England</a>. The origins of the university can be dated back to the founding of the Hartley Institution in 1862 by Henry Robertson Hartley. In 1902 the Institution developed into the Hartley University College, with degrees awarded by the <a>University of London</a>. On 29 April 1952, <a>HM Queen Elizabeth II</a>, granted a Royal Charter to give the University of Southampton full <a>university</a> status.  This was the first Royal Charter granted by HM Queen Elizabeth II on her accession to the throne.</p>
<p>The university is a member of the <a>Russell Group</a> of research universities and the <a>Worldwide Universities Network</a>. It currently has over 17,000 undergraduate and 7,000 postgraduate students.  Southampton is highly regarded as a centre for educational excellence, ranking nationally as a top 20 university in various tables, and regularly rated in the top 10 of the <a>National Student Survey</a>, and in 2010 <a>QS World University Rankings</a> ranked the university 81st overall in the world.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Hartley Institution</h3>
<p>[[File:HartleyOpening.JPG|thumb|right|230px|The arrival of Prime Minister [[Lord Palmerston]] for the opening of the Hartley Institute on the 15th October 1862]]</p>
<p>The University of Southampton has its origin as the Hartley Institution which was formed in 1862 from a benefaction by Henry Robertson Hartley (1777&#x2013;1850).  Hartley had inherited a fortune from two generations of successful wine merchants. At his death in 1850, he bequest &#x00a3;103,000 to the Southampton Corporation for the study and advancement of the sciences in his property on Southampton's High Street, in the city centre.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Hartley was an eccentric straggler, who had little liking of the new age docks and railways in Southampton. He did not desire to create a college for many (as formed at similar time in other English industrial towns and commercial ports) but a cultural centre for Southampton's intellectual elite. After initial years of financial struggle, the Hartley Institute became the Hartley College in 1883. This move was followed by increasing numbers of students, teaching staff, an expansion of the facilities and registered lodgings for students.</p>
<h3>University College</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|230px|Front of the Hartley Library, constructed in the 1930's after the move to Highfield Campus, with the support of private donors.</a></p>
<p>In 1902, the Hartley College became the Hartley <a>University College</a>, a degree awarding branch of the <a>University of London</a>. This was after inspection of the teaching and finances by the University College Grants Committee, and donations from Council members (including <a>William Darwin</a> the then Treasurer). An increase in student numbers in the following years motivated fund raising efforts to move the college to <a>greenfield land</a> around Back Lane (now University Road) in the <a>Highfield</a> area of Southampton. On the 20th June 1914, <a>Viscount Haldane</a> opened the new site of the renamed Southampton University College. However, the outbreak of the <a>First World War</a> six weeks later meant no lectures could take place there, as the buildings were handed over by the college authorities for use as a military hospital. In order to cope with the volume of casualties, wooden huts were erected at the rear of the building. These were donated to university by the <a>War Office</a> after the end of fighting, in time for the transfer from the high street premises in 1920. At this time, Highfield Hall, a former country house and overlooking <a>Southampton Common</a>, for which a lease had earlier been secured, commenced use as a <a>halls of residence</a> for female students. South Hill, on what is now the Glen Eyre Halls Complex was also acquired, along with <a>South Stoneham House</a> to house male students.</p>
<p>Further expansions through the 1920s and 30s was made possible through private donors, such as the two daughters of Edward Turner Sims for the construction of the University <a>library</a>, and from the people of Southampton, enabling new buildings on both sides of University Road. During <a>World War II</a> the university suffered damage in the <a>Southampton Blitz</a> with bombs landing on the campus and its halls of residence. The college decided against evacuation, instead expanding its Engineering Department, School of Navigation and developing a new School of Radio Telegraphy. In addition, more faculties and departments were founded, including Medicine and Oceanography (despite the discouragement of Sir <a>John Wolfenden</a>, the chairman of the University Grants Committee) In order to eliminate the expected losses, the budgets and deficits subcommittee proposed reducing staff numbers. This proposal was met with demonstrations on campus and was later reworked (to reduce the redundancies and reallocate the reductions in faculties funding) after being rejected by the university <a>Senate</a>.. In the mid 90s, the university gained two new campuses, as the <a>Winchester School of Art</a> and <a>La Sainte Union College</a> became part of the university. A new school for Nursing and Midwifery was also created and went on to provide training for <a>NHS</a> professionals in central-southern England. This involved a huge increase in student numbers and the establishment of sub-campuses in <a>Basingstoke</a>, <a>Winchester</a>, <a>Portsmouth</a> and <a>Newport, Isle of Wight</a>. The university responded to the crises by organizing a mass vaccination programme, and later took the ground breaking decision to offer all new students vaccinations, a new Sports Hall and Institute of Developmental Sciences (on the <a>Southampton General Hospital</a> site).</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>The University has five campuses located throughout the city of <a>Southampton</a> alongside the <a>School of Art</a> based in nearby <a>Winchester</a>.</p>
<h3>Highfield Campus</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|230px|Gardens on Highfield Campus</a> </p>
<p>The University's main campus is located in the residential area of <a>Highfield</a>. Opened on the 20th June 1914 the site was initially used as a military hospital during <a>World War I</a>. The campus grew gradually, mainly consisting of detailed red brick buildings (such as the Hartley library and West building of the Students' Union) designed by <a>Sir Giles Gilbert Scott</a>. In 1956 Sir <a>Basil Spence</a> was commissioned to prepare a masterplan of the campus for the foreseeable future. This included incorporating the University Road, that split the  campus in two and the quarry of Sir <a>Sidney Kimber</a>'s brickyard that itself was split by a stream. Unable to remove the road and the private houses along it, Spence designed many of the buildings facing away from it, using contemporary designs working in concrete, glass and mosaic, Justin Knowles, Nick Pope and John Edwards. It also houses the <a>John Hansard Gallery</a>, the <a>Nuffield Theatre</a> and Turner Sims.</p>
<h3>Avenue Campus</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|230px|Avenue Campus</a> </p>
<p>The Avenue Campus site was previously home to the Southampton Tramsheds and Richard Taunton's College. It was purchased by the university in December 1993 from Southampton city council for &#x00a3;2 million. The site is intended to house the Marine services division of <a>Lloyd's Register</a> who have announced a strategic alliance with the University. The campus will also be the new home of the School of Management. The research scientists from the <a>School of Medicine</a> and <a>School of Biological Sciences</a> were relocated in 2010 to either <a>Southampton General Hospital</a> or Building 85 on the main campus, depending on the research basis.</p>
<h3>National Oceanography Centre</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|230px|National Oceanography Centre</a> </p>
<p>The National Oceanography Centre, Southampton (NOCS) was a purpose-built, joint venture between the University and the <a>Natural Environment Research Council</a> (NERC). Opened in 1996 by <a>Prince Philip</a>, NOCS is located near the <a>Ocean Village</a> development in the dock area of <a>Southampton</a>.</p>
<p>The NOCS comprises the School of Ocean and Earth Sciences which operates alongside four NERC research divisions. The NOCS is also the base for the purpose-built research vessels <a>RRS <em>Discovery</em></a> and <a>RRS <em>James Cook</em></a> (and formerly <a>RRS <em>Charles Darwin</em></a>).</p>
<h3>Southampton General Hospital</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The university's presence at the general hospital dates to 1971, when Southampton (along with <a>Nottingham</a> and <a>Leicester</a> universities) became the first new Schools of Medicine to be founded in the United Kingdom in the twentieth century. As a teaching hospital, it is used by a range of undergraduate and postgraduate medical students, research academics and clinicians. Originally based in the South Academic Block, the university's presence has been expanded to include several other buildings which are home to six different research departments.</p>
<h3>Winchester School of Art</h3>
<p> <a>thumb|right|230px|Uni-link doubledecker bus passing through Highfield Campus</a></p>
<p>The Winchester School of Art was integrated within the University of Southampton in 1996. This original school premises were purpose build in the 1960s. New buildings have been designed to house the subsequent expansion of student numbers, and new facilities for fashion design, a digital media campus and also to include the internationally respected <a>Textile Conservation Centre</a> which moved its premises from <a>Hampton Court Palace</a> in 1999.</p>
<h3>Uni-link</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The Uni-link bus service was created in 1998 by the University. Four routes operate that connect the university campuses and halls of residence located throughout the city for both students at the university and general public.</p>

<h2>Student life</h2>
<h3>Students' Union</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|230px|The West Building on Highfield Campus.</a></p>
<p>The University of Southampton Students' Union (SUSU), is sited in three buildings opposite the Hartley Library. One, the West Building, dates back to the 1940s in a red brick style, complementing the Hartley Library opposite; the main building was built in the 1960s in the Basil Spence masterplan. This was extended with new nightclub and cinema facilities in 2002. The newest building was built during the mid-1990s which includes the recently refurbished Union shop, on the ground floor, and hairdressers and travel agency, both on the first floor. In May 2002 (after numerous attempts going back several years), it chose to disaffiliate itself from the <a>NUS</a>, believed by SUSU to be too bureaucratic.  In December 2010, a referendum was held to decide whether SUSU should re-affiliate with the NUS, with the result being that SUSU should remain outside the NUS. The multiple award winning student radio station, <a>Surge</a>, broadcasts from new studios in the main Union building.  The award winning website SUSU.org was created and run by students at the university. A brand new purpose built studio has been constructed for the TV station SUSUtv. The student newspaper, originally <em>Wessex News</em>, is now published once every three weeks as <em><a>Wessex Scene</a></em> following a name change in 1996. Inside the Wessex Scene is an editorially independent entertainment magazine called &quot;The Edge&quot;.  Events are held in <em>The Cube</em>, the Union's nightclub, <em>The Bridge</em>, the Union's cocktail bar, and in the <em>Stag's Head</em>, the Union pub. National touring bands play in the <em>Garden Court</em> in the West Building.</p>
<h3>Halls of Residence</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|Glen Eyre|230px</a></p>
<p>The university provides accommodation for all first year students who require it and places in <a>residences</a> are further available for <a>internationa</a>l and <a>MSc</a> students. Accommodation may be catered, self catered, have ensuite facilities, a sink in the room, or access to <a>communal bathroom</a> facilities. Each of the halls used to have a team of wardens who lived on-site and ensured students' welfare, but not anymore. Each hall also has a <a>JCR committee</a> that is responsible for the running of social events and representing the residents to the students union and the university via the Students union JCR officer. Some of the halls also have bars which are separately run by the students union and are staffed by current and ex residents.</p>
<p>There are three main complexes of halls of residence. The Glen Eyre Halls Complex lies less than half a mile to the north of Highfield Campus. Set in landscaped surroundings, the complexes houses over 2000 students. These are spread though various buildings, designed and constructed throughout the Universities history. The <a>Wessex Lane Halls</a> complex lies approximately one mile east of the Highfield Campus. Situated next to the gardens of South Stoneham House it houses over 1800 students. Included is Connaught Hall, one of the original halls of residence of the University. The Small Halls accommodate around 1000 students across 7 city locations, within  of Highfield Campus. The University also has halls of residence in <a>Winchester</a> for School of Art students, <a>Portsmouth</a> and <a>Basingstoke</a> for School of Nursing and Midwifery students.</p>

<h3>Sports</h3>
<p>The Sports and Recreation (SportsRec) runs the university sports facilities which are based predominately at two locations. The Jubilee Sports Centre, opened in 2004 at a cost of &#x00a3;8.5 million is located on the Highfield Campus. Included within in the centre are a six-lane, 25-metre swimming pool, full gym and sports hall. In addition to its indoor sports facilities, the University completed a &#x00a3;4.3 million re-development of its  outdoor facilities located at Wide Lane, <a>Eastleigh</a> (near Southampton) in 2007. Within the complex includes flood-lit synthetic turf pitches, tennis courts, and pavilion). A number of elite athletes are supported by the SportsRec through sports bursaries and the UK Government's Talented Athlete Scholarship Scheme (TASS) .</p>
<p>The University Athletic Union was formally established on the 29th November 1929, by the University College council. Versions of the union had existed previously to which many clubs such as Cricket, Association Football, Rugby, Boxing, Gymnastics, Tennis and Boat clubs (all formed before the turn of the 20th century) were members.</p>
<p>Throughout its history the university has had a number successful teams in <a>national student championships</a>.</p>
