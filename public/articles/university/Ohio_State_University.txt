<h2>History</h2>
<p> Ohio State University was founded in 1870 as a <a>land-grant university</a> in accordance with the <a>Morrill Act of 1862</a> under the name of Ohio Agricultural and Mechanical College. The school was originally situated within a farming community located on the northern edge of Columbus. While some interests in the state had hoped that the new university would focus on matriculating students of various agricultural and mechanical disciplines, Governor <a>Rutherford B. Hayes</a> foresaw a more classic, comprehensive university, and manipulated both the university's location and its initial board of trustees towards that end.  Later that year, the university welcomed its first class of 24 students.  In 1878, and in light of its expanded focus, the college permanently changed its name to the now-familiar &quot;Ohio State University&quot;, with &quot;The&quot; as part of its official name, although the state code that declares the &quot;The&quot; neglects it in sections including in the title of the section that originally declares it.</p>
<p>Internationally, in 2010 <a>QS World University Rankings</a> ranked Ohio State University 124th in the world, and 40th in the United States. It scored 88th in Social Sciences in the international subject rankings. Three years back, China's <a>Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a> placed Ohio State as the 61st ranked university in the world in their 2007 <a>Academic Ranking of World Universities</a>.</p>
<p>The Lombardi Program on Measuring University Performance at <a>Arizona State University</a> detailed analysis and rankings of American universities currently places Ohio State as the 24th ranked university in America, the 10th ranked public university in the country and the top overall university in Ohio.  Of their nine ranking criteria, Ohio State ranked in the top-25 in four categories and between 26-50 in an additional four categories.  The <a>Washington Monthly</a> college rankings, which seek to evaluate colleges' contributions to American society based on factors of social mobility, cutting edge research, and service to the country by their graduates, currently place Ohio State as 12th in the nation and 10th among public universities.</p>
<p>Ohio State is also the only public university in Ohio to which the <a>Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching</a> has given both its highest overall classification of <em>Doctoral/Very High Research Activity</em> and highest undergraduate admissions classification of <em>more selective</em>.</p>
<p><em>US News</em> ranks the undergraduate program at Ohio State's <a>Fisher College of Business</a> 12th in America and the top undergraduate business school in Ohio.  The graduate program of the Fisher College is ranked 21st in America and is the top graduate school of business in Ohio.  <em><a>The Economist</a></em> ranked The Fisher College as the 29th ranked MBA program in the world in their 2005 <em>&quot;Which MBA?&quot;</em> issue.  Fisher's Executive MBA program was ranked 3rd nationally for return on investment by <a>The Wall Street Journal</a> in 2008 citing a 170 percent return on an average of $66,900 invested in tuition and expenses during the 18-month program. In 2006, The Public Accounting Report ranked Ohio State's accounting department 9th in the nation for undergraduate programs and 10th in the nation for graduate programs.  In each case, the ranking was the highest among Ohio universities.</p>

<p>Ohio State's <a>political science</a> department is ranked 13th in the country by <em>US News &amp; World Report</em>, with the American politics section fifth, international politics 12th and political methodology 10th.  A study by Simon Hix of The <a>London School of Economics</a> ranked it as the fourth best political science department in the world, based on publications.  <em><a>Foreign Policy Magazine</a></em> recently ranked it as the 15th best Ph.D. program in the world for the study of international relations while noting Professor <a>Alexander Wendt</a> as the third most influential scholar of international relations in the world.</p>
<p>Ohio State is one of a select few top American universities to offer multiple area studies programs under &quot;Comprehensive National Resource Center&quot; (often called &quot;Title VI&quot;) funding from the <a>U.S. Department of Education</a>.  The most notable of these is the Center for Slavic and East European Studies founded in 1965 by Professor Leon Twarog.  Subsequently, Ohio State's Middle Eastern Studies Center and East Asian Studies Center also achieved Comprehensive National Resource Center status.  The university is also home to the <a>interdisciplinary</a> <a>Mershon Center for International Security Studies</a>, which was founded in 1952 through a bequest of 7 million dollars (54.3 million in 2006 value) from alumnus Colonel Ralph D. Mershon.  In 2003, it was decided by the United States <a>Department of Homeland Security</a> to base the <a>National Academic Consortium for Homeland Security</a> at The Mershon Center.</p>
<p>In a study by industry publication <em>Dance Teacher</em>, a survey of 100 dance department chairs in the United States and Canada ranked Ohio State's Department of <a>Dance</a> as the top ranked graduate program and the second ranked undergraduate program in North America.</p>
<p><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a> ranked the graduate program in Design at #5 in the nation in their 2009 rankings. Overall, the graduate Art program ranked #21, with the ceramics and glass programs at #6. In its 2008 edition of &quot;America's Best Architecture &amp; Design Schools, the journal <em>DesignIntelligence</em> ranked the undergraduate <a>Industrial Design</a> program #3 nationwide, and the graduate program in Design #10 nationwide. The DFC conducted their research by polling 270 corporations regarding how design schools were preparing their students for the future of professional practice in design. OSU was in the top ten rankings of the corporate leaders' assessments in all regions (#4 in the south, #2 in the midwest, #7 in the east, and #4 in the west). The graduate program placed at #3 in the south and #2 in the east, resulting in 10th overall in the nation.</p>

In 2009, 17 Ohio State faculty were elected as AAAS Fellows. Each year since 2002, Ohio State has either led or been second among all American universities in the number of their faculty elected as fellows to the AAAS. <a>thumb|right|Physics Research Building</a> In a recent study by Harvard University's Graduate School of Education, Ohio State was one of five universities rated as &quot;exemplary&quot; workplaces for junior faculty.  In the study, 31 universities and 11 liberal arts colleges were evaluated on tenure clarity and fairness, nature of work including workloads, quality of students, and teaching environment, compensation, work and family balance, collegiality and overall satisfaction.</p>
<p>In the last quarter century, 32 Ohio State faculty members have been awarded the prestigious <a>Guggenheim Fellowship</a>, which is more than all other public and private Ohio universities combined.  In 2008, three Ohio State faculty were awarded Guggenheim Fellowships, placing Ohio State among the top 15 universities in the nation.  Since the 2000-2001 award year, 55 Ohio State faculty members have been named as <a>Fulbright Fellows</a>, the highest of any Ohio university.</p>
<p>In a 2007 report released by the <a>National Science Foundation</a>, Ohio State&#x2019;s research expenditures for 2006 were <a>$</a>652 million, placing it 7th among public universities and 11th overall, also ranking 3rd among all American universities for private industry sponsored research.  Research expenditures at Ohio State were $720 million in 2007.  Ohio State also announced in 2006, that it would be designating at least $110 million of its research efforts to what it termed &quot;fundamental concerns&quot; such as research towards a cure for cancer, renewable energy sources and sustainable drinking water supplies.</p>
<h3>Admissions and tuition</h3>
<p>Undergraduate admissions to Ohio State are classified as &#x201c;more selective&#x201d; by <em><a>US News &amp; World Report</a></em> and <em><a>The Princeton Review</a></em> and according to the data are the most selective for any public university in Ohio.  The 2009 freshman class had an acceptance rate of 52%, with 54% of students graduating in the top 10% of their high school class and 87% in the top 25% of their class.  The 2007 freshman class had an acceptance rate of 52%, and the enrolled freshman class had the following composition: students graduating in the top 10% of their high school class (57%); the top 25% of their high school class (91%); the top 50% of their high school class (99%).  27% of the freshman class scored in the top 3% of the SAT or ACT, while 72% scored in the top 15%.  The middle 50% range of ACT scores for the enrolled class was 26-30, with an average ACT score of 27.  Of the 6,122 members of the 2006 freshman class, 290 had been named <a>valedictorian</a> of their high school's graduating class.  Ohio State&#x2019;s freshman class has admitted over 100 National Merit Scholars for nine of the last ten years.</p>
<p>Tuition for full-time, Ohio residents attending Ohio State for the 2010-2011 academic year is $9,420.  For the 2006-2007 academic year, tuition at Ohio State for Ohio residents placed it as the fifth most expensive public university and slightly beneath the weighted average tuition of $8,553 among Ohio's thirteen public four-year universities. In addition to being named a <em>Best in the Midwest</em> selection by <em>The Princeton Review</em>, Ohio State was also the only public university in Ohio to make their list of <em>America's 150 Best Value Colleges</em>.</p>
<h3>Endowment and fundraising</h3>
<p>Ohio State was among the first group of public universities to raise a $1 billion <a>endowment</a> when it passed the $1 billion mark in 1999.  At year&#x2019;s end 2005, Ohio State&#x2019;s endowment stood at $1.73 billion, ranking it seventh among public universities and 27th among all American universities.  In June 2006, the endowment passed the $2 billion mark.</p>
<p>In recent decades, and in response to continually shrinking state funding, Ohio State has conducted two significant multi-year <a>fundraising</a> campaigns.  The first concluded in 1987 and raised $460 million&#x2014;a record at the time for a public university.  The &#x201c;Affirm Thy Friendship Campaign&#x201d; took place between 1995 and 2000.  With an initial goal of raising $850 million, the campaign&#x2019;s final tally was $1.23 billion, placing Ohio State among the small group of public universities to have successfully conducted a $1 billion campaign. At his welcoming ceremony, returning President E. Gordon Gee announced that, in the Fall of 2007, Ohio State would be launching a $2.5 billion fund-raising campaign.</p>

<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>thumb|Orton Hall</a> Ohio State's 3,469 acres of campus is approximately  north of the city's downtown.  Four buildings are currently listed on the <a>National Register of Historic Places</a>: Enarson Hall, <a>Hayes Hall</a>, <a>Ohio Stadium</a>, and <a>Orton Hall</a>. Architecture on Ohio State campus does not conform to a unifying theme such as <a>Gothic revival</a> or <a>Georgian</a> but rather is an eclectic mix of traditional, modern and post-modern styles.</p>
<p>The <a>William Oxley Thompson Memorial Library</a>, anchoring the western end of The Oval, is Ohio State library's main branch and single largest repository.  The Thompson Library was designed in 1913 by the Boston firm of Allen and Collens in the Italianate Renaissance Revival style, and its placement on the Oval was suggested by the Olmsted brothers who had designed New York City's <a>Central Park</a>.  In 2006, the Thompson Library began a $100 million dollar renovation with the stated aims of becoming a &quot;global benchmark twenty-first century&quot; library while maintaining the building's classical Italian Renaissance architecture. <a>thumb|right|Wexner Center for the Arts</a> Overall, Ohio State operates the 18th largest university <a>research library</a> in North America with a combined collection of over 5.8 million volumes.  Additionally, the libraries receive approximately 35,000 serial titles on a regular basis.  Its recent acquisitions were 16th among university research libraries in North America.  Ohio State's library system encompasses twenty-one libraries located on its Columbus campus.  An additional eight branches are located at off-campus research facilities, regional campuses, and a book storage depository near campus.  In all Ohio State library system encompasses fifty-five branches and specialty collections.  Some of the more significant collections include The <a>Byrd Polar Research Center</a> Archival Program containing the Archives of Admiral <a>Richard E. Byrd</a> as well as a significant collection of polar research materials, The <a>Hilandar Research Library</a> which contains the world's largest collection of <a>medieval</a> <a>Slavic</a> manuscripts on microform, <a>Ohio State Cartoon Library &amp; Museum</a>, which is the world's largest repository of original cartoons, <a>The Lawrence and Lee Theatre Research Institute</a> and the archives of Senator <a>John Glenn</a>.</p>
<p>Anchoring the traditional campus gateway at the eastern end of The Oval, is the <a>Wexner Center for the Arts</a>.  Designed by architects <a>Peter Eisenman</a> of New York and Richard Trott of Columbus, the center opened in 1989.  Its founding was financed in large part by Ohio State alumnus <a>Leslie Wexner</a> with a gift of twenty-five million dollars in the 1980s.  The center was founded to be a comprehensive visual arts center encompassing all aspects of visual and performing arts with a focus on new commissions and artist residencies. Part of its design was to pay tribute to the armory that formerly had the same location.  Its groundbreaking <a>deconstructivist</a> architecture has resulted in it being lauded as one of the most important buildings of its generation.  Its design has also been criticized as proving less than ideal for many of the art installations that it has attempted to display.  The centerpiece of The Wexner Center's permanent collection is <a>Picasso's</a> <em><a>Nude on a Black Armchair</a></em>, which was purchased by alumnus <a>Leslie Wexner</a> at auction for forty-five million dollars and then donated to the university.</p>
<p>To the south of The Oval is another, somewhat smaller, expanse of greenspace commonly referred to as The South Oval.  At its eastern end, it is anchored by Ohio Union.  To the west are Enarson Hall, the Kuhn Honors House, Browning Amphitheatre (a traditional stone <a>Greek theatre</a>) and <a>Mirror Lake</a>.</p>
<p>The <a>Ohio State College of Medicine</a> is located on the southern edge of the central campus.  It is home to the <a>James Cancer Hospital</a>, a cancer research institute and one of the <a>National Cancer Institute's</a> forty-one <a>comprehensive cancer centers</a>, along with <a>the Richard M. Ross Heart Hospital</a>, a research institute for cardiovascular disease.</p>

<h2>Student life</h2>
<p><a>thumb|380px|right|Recreation and Physical Activity Center (RPAC)</a> The Office of Student Life is responsible for many of the outside-the-classroom aspects of student life at Ohio State. Among these are student housing; food service; health, wellness and counseling; activities, organizations and leadership development; recreation and intramurals. The Office of Student Life also operates the <a>Schottenstein Center</a>, the Fawcett Center, the <a>Blackwell Inn</a>, the <a>Ohio Union</a> the <a>Drake Events Center</a>, and the Wilce Student Health Center, named for football coach and university physician <a>John Wilce</a>.</p>
<p>Ohio State has several student managed publications and media outlets. <em>The Makio</em> is the official yearbook. <em>The Makio&#x2019;s</em> sales plummeted by 60% during the early 1970s; the organization went bankrupt and stopped publication during the late 1970s. The book was revived from 1985 to 1994 and has since been revived again in 2000 thanks to several student organizations.  <em><a>The Lantern</a></em> is the school's daily newspaper and has operated as a laboratory newspaper in the School of Communication (formerly the School of Journalism) since 1881. <em>Mosaic</em> is a literary magazine published by Ohio State, which features undergraduate <a>fiction</a>, <a>poetry</a>, and <a>art</a>. There are two student-run radio stations on campus. <a>OHIO.FM</a> is the music station and Scarlet and Gray Sports Radio broadcasts eleven different Ohio State sports. Both stations broadcast on an Internet audio stream (no broadcast signals are available in Columbus). Students also operate a local cable channel known as <a>Buckeye TV</a>, which airs primarily on the campus cable system operated by the Office of Information Technology (OIT).</p>
<p>The <a>marching band</a> is also a longstanding tradition at Ohio State. It is the largest all-brass and percussion band in the world. The traditional school songs from &quot;<a>Carmen Ohio</a>&quot; to &quot;<a>Hang on Sloopy</a>&quot; to &quot;Fight the Team Across the Field&quot;, are arranged to fit this unique instrumentation. The band is famous for &quot;<a>Script Ohio</a>&quot;, during which the band marches single-file through the curves of the word &quot;Ohio&quot;, much like a pen writes the word, all the while playing the French march &quot;Le Regiment de Sambre et Meuse.&quot; At the end of the performance, the &quot;i&quot; in &quot;Ohio&quot; is &quot;dotted&quot; by a high-stepping senior <a>sousaphone</a> player.</p>
<p>Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as <a>commencement</a> and <a>convocation</a>, and athletic games are: <em>Across the Field</em>, Ohio State University <a>fight song</a> and &quot;Buckeye Battle Cry&quot;.</p>
<p>The tradition of high quality bands is not limited to the football field. OSU's School of Music contains several high quality concert bands consisting of graduate and undergraduate music majors and non-music majors. The OSU Wind Symphony, frequently receives praise on the national level, recently having been selected to perform at the 2003 College Band Directors National Association (CBDNA) Convention and at Ohio Music Educators Association Conference in 2001, 2004, 2006, and 2008; the OSU Symphonic Band performed in 2007. The OSU Wind Symphony has recently released its newest album,, &quot;Southern Harmony,&quot; the <a>Naxos</a> Label in 2009. The <a>Ohio State Jazz Ensemble</a> performed at the <a>Montreux Jazz Festival</a> in 1975, 1978,1986, 1996, and 2001. It has also appeared at the <a>Mexico City International Jazz Festival</a> in 1990 and the <a>North Sea Jazz Festival</a> in 1986, 1996, and 2001.  In addition there is also an OSU Symphony Orchestra.</p>
<p>In addition to strong bands, the university is also recognized for outstanding choral performance. Ohio State Men's <a>Glee Club</a>, formed in 1875, is the oldest organization on campus. In 1990, led by Professor James Gallagher, the Men's Glee Club participated in the International Musical <a>Eisteddfod</a> in Llangolen, <a>Wales</a> and won the male chorus competition by an unprecedented 20 points before, in a unanimous decision of the judges, being named &quot;Choir of the World&quot;&#x2014;the first American <a>choir</a> to win such an honor. The Glee Club is under the direction of Dr. Robert J. Ward.</p>
<p>Ohio State's &quot;<a>Buckeye Bullet</a>&quot; electric car broke the world record for the fastest speed by an electric vehicle on October 3, 2004 with a speed of 271.737&nbsp;mph (437.3&nbsp;km/h) at the <a>Bonneville Salt Flats</a> in <a>Utah</a>. The vehicle also holds the US record for fastest electric vehicle with a speed of 314.958&nbsp;mph (506.9&nbsp;km/h), and peak timed mile speed of 321.834&nbsp;mph (517.9&nbsp;km/h). The vehicle was designed, built and managed by a team of engineering students at the university's &quot;Center for Automotive Research-Intelligent Transportation&quot; (CAR-IT).  In 2007, <a>Buckeye Bullet 2</a> was launched.  This follow-up effort was a collaboration between Ohio State engineering students and engineers from the <a>Ford Motor Company</a> and will seek to break the landspeed record for hydrogen cell powered vehicles.&lt;!-- this needs updated - did end up breaking landspeed records --&gt;</p>
<p>A unique aspect to Ohio State's multi billion dollar endowment is the Student Investment Management Program.  Upperclass finance students taking Business Finance 724 are given the opportunity to manage a twenty million dollar investment fund.  Returns from the student managed funds often outperform the <a>S&amp;P 500</a> and frequently even the university's own professional fund managers.</p>
<p>The Residence Hall Advisory Council (RHAC), which is a representative body of all students living in the University's dormitory facilities, helps evaluate and improve the living conditions for dormitory residents.</p>
<p><a>Jon Stewart</a> hosted <em><a>The Daily Show's</a></em> &quot;Battlefield Ohio: <em>The Daily Show</em>&#x2019;s Midwest Midterm Midtacular&quot; from Ohio State's Roy Bowen Theatre during the week of October 30 to November 2, 2006.</p>
<h3>Diversity</h3>
<p>Ohio State's main campus has been lauded in recent years for the diversity of its student body.  In various surveys and rankings it has been included among the best campuses in the nation for African Americans.  Additionally, Ohio State ranked 10th in the nation in 2006 for the numbers of African American doctors graduated.  <em>The Advocate College Guide for LGBT Students</em> lists Ohio State as one of the best campuses in America for <a>LGBT</a> students.</p>
<p>Ohio State, despite selective admissions, has also maintained a high amount of socio-economic diversity among its students.  The 2007 freshman class contained 22.7% of first generation college students which far exceeded the national norm on American campuses of 15.9%.</p>
<h3>Residential life</h3>
<p><a>thumb|200px|South Campus Gateway</a> Ohio State operates 31 on-campus residence halls divided into three geographic clusters: South Campus (site of the university's original dormitories), North Campus (largely constructed during the post-war enrollment boom) and Olentangy Area or &quot;The Towers.&quot;  Within the residence hall system are 40 smaller living and learning environments defined by social or academic considerations.  Ohio State also offers four honors residence halls: Bradley Hall, Lincoln House, Siebert Hall, and Taylor Tower.</p>
<p>Separate housing for graduate and professional students is maintained on the Southern tier of campus near the medical complex.  Family housing is maintained at Buckeye Village at the far northern edge of campus beyond the athletic complex.  At the university's southeast corner along High Street, and across from the <a>Moritz College of Law</a>, new apartments have been built for law students in conjunction with the area's Campus Gateway project.</p>
<h3>Honors programs</h3>
<p>Ohio State offers two distinct honors programs for high ability <a>undergraduates</a>: Honors and Scholars. The Honors program is open to students in all majors.  The Scholars program is centered around thirteen specific programs such as &quot;Architecture Scholars&quot;, &quot;Communication Technology Scholars&quot;,&quot;Biological Sciences Scholars&quot;, &quot;International Affairs Scholars&quot; and &quot;Politics, Society and Law Scholars.&quot;  Students in the Scholars program are expected to live and take select classes with other members of the program.  Additionally, Ohio State offers the Honors Collegium with membership extended following the Spring of a student's first or second year to the university's top undergraduates.  Collegium students try to compete for internships, graduate schools and nationally competitive awards, such as the <a>Marshall</a>, <a>Rhodes</a>, or <a>Truman</a> Scholarships.</p>
<p>Ohio State also administers two large-scale <a>scholarship programs</a> to ensure access to the university to high-ability students from <a>low-income</a> or traditionally underrepresented groups.  The first of these, The Young Scholars Program, was initiated in 1988.  120 promising minority students from Ohio's nine largest urban public school districts are selected prior to entering high school.  The program offers a series of academic camps each summer and counseling throughout the students' high school careers.  Upon completion of the program, which also mandates a college preparatory curriculum and minimum grade point average, the students are guaranteed admission to Ohio State as well as any need-based financial aid necessary.  The Land Grant Scholarship was initiated in 2005.  This program seeks to ensure access to Ohio State to high-ability students from low-income backgrounds.  Ohio State has committed to offering a full-ride scholarship each academic year to at least one student from each of <a>Ohio's 88 counties</a>.</p>
<p>Ohio State maintains an honors center in the Kuhn Honors and Scholars House which had served as the University President's residence until the 1960s. Four dormitories are designated all or in part as honors residences: Taylor, Bradley, Siebert, and Lincoln.</p>
<h3>Activities and organizations</h3>
<p><a>thumb|200px|Enarson Hall (Original Ohio Union)</a> The <a>Ohio Union</a> was the first student union built by an American public university.  Ohio Union is dedicated to the enrichment of the student experience, on and off Ohio State University campus.  The first Ohio Union, located on the south edge of the South Oval, was constructed in 1909 and was later renamed Enarson Hall. The second Ohio Union was completed in 1950 and was located prominently along High Street, southeast of the Oval. It was a center of student life at Ohio State University for more than 50 years, providing facilities for student activities, organizations and events, and serving as an important meeting place for campus and community interaction. In addition, many student services and programs were housed in the union, along with dining and recreational facilities. The second Ohio Union was demolished in February 2007 to make way for the new Ohio Union which was finished in 2010.  During this time, student activities had been relocated to Ohio Stadium and other academic buildings.</p>

<h3>Student governments</h3>
<p>At Ohio State University, there are three recognized student governments that represent their constituents.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Undergraduate Student Government (USG), which consists of elected and appointed student <a>representatives</a> who serve as liaisons from the <a>undergraduate</a> student body to university officials. USG seeks to outreach to and work for the students at Ohio State University.</li>
  <li>Council of Graduate Students (CGS), which promotes and provides <a>academic</a>, <a>administrative</a>, and social programs for the university community in general and for <a>graduate students</a> in particular. The Council provides a forum in which the graduate student body may present, discuss, and set upon issues related to its role in the academic and non-academic aspects of the University community.</li>
  <li>Inter-Professional Council (IPC), which is a representative body of all professional students in the colleges of <a>Dentistry</a>, <a>Law</a>, <a>Medicine</a>, <a>Optometry</a>, <a>Pharmacy</a>, and <a>Veterinary Medicine</a>. Its purpose is to act as a liaison between these students and the governing bodies of the University.</li>
