<h2>B.Sc. International Business and Politics</h2>

The <a>|nternational Business and Politics</a> programme is a unique combination of economics, finance, management and political science and it aims at educating students such that they are better qualified for their future careers which can hardly be seen in isolation from any of the areas in question.  B.Sc. IBP is one of the bachelor degrees in Denmark with the highest GPA entrance requirement and each year it attracts an increased number of both Danish and international students. It is the only degree in Denmark with the described academic disciplinary combination.  </p>
<p>The courses are focused around various aspects of economics and finance, business and management as well as international political economy disciplines. The political science dimension adds to the curriculum theoretical debates on democracy, power, political decision-making etc. preparing the students to analyze political processes in national and international organizations and political systems. Thus, graduates from the B.Sc. IBP have strong analytical skills, in particular, concerning relations between businesses, governments and civil society. IBP graduates have gone to work in various multinational companies, institutions and embassies around the world or they have pursued higher university degrees either in Denmark or abroad.</p>

<h2>360&#x02da;  Students for Sustainability</h2>
<p>[<a>http://360students.dk/</a>| 360&#x02da; - Students for Sustainability] is a student organization at CBS that tries to encourage and enable students to meet and share knowledge about issues wihtin the broad spectrum of sustainability. Here, certain topics are chosen as focal points for the ongoing projects and activities in the organization in order to put classic as well as less known issues of sustainability into new perspective.  These self-initiated activities are often made in collaboration with a broad range of relevant actors within businesses, other universities, NGOs, media and public institutions. In that way, by participating or simply by showing up at seminars, extra lectures, green campus activities, career fairs and movie nights, the students automatically generate and help raise awareness in the surrounding community about sustainability issues. That is both environmental, social and financial sustainability in companies and organizations, responsible business and organizational practices and opportunities in the developing world for the private and public sector. 360 is well aware that there are inummerable challenges associated with developing sustainable approaches for businesses and citizens and it is exactly the purpose to add more thought to this.</p>
