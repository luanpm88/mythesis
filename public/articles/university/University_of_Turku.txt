<h2>History</h2>
<h3>The Royal Academy of Turku</h3>
<p> The first university to be established in Turku was <a>The Royal Academy of Turku</a>, in 1640, which was transferred to the new Capital, <a>Helsinki</a>, after the <a>Great Fire of Turku</a> in 1827.</p>
<p>Three famous Finns began their studies in Turku in 1822. These were <a>Johan Vilhelm Snellman</a>, <a>Elias L&#x00f6;nnrot</a>, and <a>Johan Ludvig Runeberg</a> who have a statue on University Hill. Another reminder of the Royal Academy is the <a>Old Academy Building</a> near the University's campus.</p>
<h3>The University of Turku</h3>
<p><a>thumb|250px|The grand opening of the University of Turku in 1922. On the left is Artturi H. Virkkunen, the first rector of the university</a> The modern University of Turku was founded in 1920. The Finnish intelligentsia wanted a purely <a>Finnish</a> university, the first of its kind in Finland. 22,040 people contributed to the fund-raising campaign. Newly gained independence and the campaign are reflected in the motto of the University about a free people's gift to free science. To honour the memory of these donors, the University has named its specially created <a>liqueur</a> &quot;22 040&quot;. Developed by the University's own food chemists, the liqueur does homage to some of the distinctive fruits of the Finnish landscape: the <a>cloudberry</a>, the <a>rowan</a> and the <a>sea buckthorn</a>.</p>
<p>The first premises of the University of Turku were in the centre of the city, by the market square. In the 1950s a new campus was built on Ryss&#x00e4;nm&#x00e4;ki (<em>Russian Hill</em> &ndash; now known as University Hill). In the 1960s the University started to expand rapidly, a process that still continues.</p>
<p>The University was made a public institution in 1974.</p>
<p>Since 1995 the University of Turku has been a member of <a>Coimbra Group</a>.</p>
<p>In January 2010, <a>Turku School of Economics</a> merged with the University of Turku, forming a seventh faculty of the university.</p>
