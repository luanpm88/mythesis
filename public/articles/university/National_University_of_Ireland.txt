<p>The <strong>National University of Ireland</strong> (<strong>NUI</strong>), (), is a <a>federal</a> <a>university</a> system of <em>constituent universities</em>, previously called <em><a>constituent colleges</a></em>, and <em>recognised colleges</em> set up under the <a>Irish Universities Act, 1908</a>, and significantly amended by the <a>Universities Act, 1997</a>. On 20 January 2010 the Minister of Education and Science, <a>Batt O'Keeffe</a>, announced his intention to dissolve the National University of Ireland.</p>
<p>The constituent universities are for all essential purposes independent universities, except that the <a>degrees</a> and <a>diplomas</a> are those of the National University of Ireland with its seat in <a>Dublin</a>.</p>

<p>&#x2020; St Angela's College maintains its links to the National University of Ireland by being <em>&quot;A College of the National University of Ireland, Galway&quot;</em> from January 2006. This in effect means that students of the college are registered as students of the National University of Ireland, Galway &#x2014; the National University of Ireland continues to grant degrees and diplomas of such students when they graduate.</p>
<p>&#x2021; In accordance with the Universities Act 1997 (Section 48) graduates of the recognised college of St. Patrick's College, Maynooth who received a degree of the National University of Ireland before the commencement of the act are considered graduates of the constituent university known as the National University of Ireland, Maynooth.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>[[Image:NUI HQ Merrion Square.jpg|thumb|right|The offices of the NUI, on [[Merrion Square]] in Dublin]] <em>Queen's Colleges</em> at <a>Belfast</a>, <a>Cork</a>, and <a>Galway</a> were established in 1845; in 1849 teaching commenced and a year later they were united under the <em><a>Queen's University of Ireland</a></em>. The <em><a>Catholic University of Ireland</a></em> was created as an independent university on November 3, 1854 for the education of <a>Catholics</a>, this university however was neither a recognised university nor offered recognised degrees. In 1880 the <em><a>Royal University of Ireland</a></em> took over the degree awarding functions of the two former universities and offered recognised degrees to the graduates of the new <a>University College Dublin</a> and <a>St Patrick's College, Maynooth</a>, previously awarded under the Catholic University. The Catholic University became University College Dublin in 1882 under the direction of the <a>Jesuits</a> and its students, in the 1890s achieved more distinctions than their counteparts in Belfast, Cork and Galway which were established as secular institutions.</p>
<p>The 1908 reforms created the <em>National University of Ireland</em> and a separate <em><a>Queen's University of Belfast</a></em>. The Royal University was dissolved in 1909 and in 1910 Maynooth became a recognised college of the NUI.  In 1996 the <a>National College of Art and Design</a> became a recognised college of the NUI. The 1997 reforms restructured the National University of Ireland, and an additional university at <a>Maynooth</a> was created from certain faculties of the previous recognised college, <em><a>St Patrick's College, Maynooth</a></em>. These reforms also removed the prohibition on theology that had been imposed on the National University and its predecessors.</p>
<h3>Legislative constituency</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Since 1918 the university's graduates have formed a constituency in parliamentary elections. In 1918 it was formed as a constituency for the UK House of Commons. After the first election Eoin MacNeill abstained from Westminster and sat in the first D&#x00e1;il. The NUI graduates elected four TDs (to <a>D&#x00e1;il &#x00c9;ireann</a>) from 1921 until 1934 when the university constituencies were abolished by Fianna F&#x00e1;il.</p>
<p>Under the <a>Constitution of Ireland</a>, adopted in 1937, the graduates of the university elect three members of <a>Seanad &#x00c9;ireann</a> (the senate). All graduates that are Irish citizens (regardless of living in the state or not) are entitled to vote if on the university's register of electors. An <a>honorary degree</a> does not give the entitlement to vote. The election is conducted by postal vote.</p>
<p>The most recent election was in 2007, for the <a>23rd Seanad</a>, and returned three <a>independent</a>s: <a>Joe O'Toole</a>, <a>Feargal Quinn</a>, and <a>R&#x00f3;n&#x00e1;n Mullen</a>.</p>
<h3>University chancellors</h3>
<p>The <a>chancellor</a> is the notional head of the university, and constituent universities and recognised colleges have their own heads, which exercise most powers in  practice. When the university was established in 1908 by <a>Royal Charter</a>, the first chancellor was appointed; all subsequent chancellors are elected by <a>convocation</a>, as set out in university statutes. The chancellor is elected by graduates and staff whenever there is a vacancy.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>William Joseph Walsh</a> (1908 &#x2013; 1921)</li>
  <li><a>&#x00c9;amon de Valera</a> (1921 &#x2013; 1975)</li>
  <li><a>T. K. Whitaker</a> (1976 &#x2013; 1996)</li>
  <li><a>Garret Fitzgerald</a> (1997 &#x2013; 2009)</li>
  <li><a>Maurice Manning</a> (2009 &#x2013; incumbent)</li>
</ul>
<h2>University faculties</h2>
<p>Within the university there is a common faculty structure in operation in the constituent universities. These ten faculties are: <a>Agriculture</a>; <a>Arts</a>; <a>Celtic Studies</a>; <a>Commerce</a>; <a>Engineering</a> &amp; <a>Architecture</a>; <a>Food Science</a> &amp; <a>Technology</a>; <a>Law</a>; <a>Medicine</a> &amp; <a>Health Sciences</a>; <a>Philosophy</a> &amp; <a>Sociology</a>; <a>Science</a>; and <a>Veterinary Medicine</a>.</p>
