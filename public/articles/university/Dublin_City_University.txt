<p></p>
<p><strong>Dublin City University</strong> (abbreviated as <strong>DCU</strong>) () is a <a>university</a> situated between <a>Glasnevin</a>, <a>Santry</a>, <a>Ballymun</a> and <a>Whitehall</a> on the <a>Northside</a> of <a>Dublin</a> in <a>Ireland</a>. Created as the <em><a>National Institute for Higher Education</a>, Dublin</em> in 1975, it enrolled its first students in 1980 and was elevated to university status (along with the <a>University of Limerick</a>) in 1989 by <a>statute</a>.</p>
<p>The university currently has around 6,000 undergraduate students, over 600 research postgraduates, 1,800 taught postgraduate students and over 35,000 alumni. In addition the university has around 1,100 distance education (Oscail) students.</p>
<p>There were 440 academic staff in 2006. Notable members of the academic staff include former <a>Taoiseach</a> <a>John Bruton</a> and the &quot;thinking&quot; Guru <a>Edward De Bono</a>. Bruton accepted a position as Adjunct Faculty Member in the School of Law and Government in early 2004 and De Bono accepted an adjunct Professorship in the university in mid 2005.</p>
<p>The founding president of the institution was Dr Danny O'Hare, who retired in 1999 after 22 years' service. After a period of administration by an acting president (Professor Albert Pratt), Professor <a>Ferdinand von Prondzynski</a>, was appointed and continued as president for a full term, which ended in July 2010. He was succeeded by current president, Professor Brian MacCraith.</p>

<p>The institution was created in 1975, on an <a>ad-hoc</a> basis, and on June 18 that year Dr Danny O'Hare was made acting director of the institution, and a day later the first governing body met. It was intended at this stage that the institution become the unified structure under which the colleges of what later became <a>Dublin Institute of Technology</a> would unite, but by 1978 it became apparent that this would not be the case and instead an independent institution developed with a distinct identity and mission.</p>
<p>In 1979, the institution was located on an 344,000&nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (85 <a>acre</a>) site  from the city centre, just north of Dublin City Council's Albert College Park; the <em><a>Albert College Building</a></em> is the only significant remaining building from before this period. The <a>Henry Grattan</a> building was the first new building completed in 1981, along with the adjoining restaurant, and many buildings have been added since, to form a modern university campus.</p>
<p>The total area of the main campus is approximately  and is bordered by Collins Avenue, Albert College Park, Ballymun Road, Hillside Farm and St. Aidan's School. There are another  at St. Clare's Sports Grounds on the west side of Ballymun Road. This part of the campus also includes the Sports Pavilion. A further  (including Elmhurst House) situated along Griffith Avenue have been acquired. Entrances to the main campus are from Ballymun Road, to the west, and Collins Avenue, to the north.</p>
<p>The early focus of the institution was, in particular, on science and technology, although it has also had, and has, a large business school. It has recently developed a presence also in the performing arts and in the humanities. DCU is also famous for its programme of work placement or <em>INTRA</em> (INtegrated TRAining), which was the first such programme in Ireland.</p>
<p>As of 2008 there are over 35,000 graduates of Dublin City University.</p>
<p>There was a plan in 2002 to base the headquarters of the Irish Academy for the Performing Arts in DCU, but this was later scrapped. &lt;!--Alternate Link <a>http://wwa.rte.ie/news/2000/0112/arts.html--</a>&gt; &lt;!--Alternate Link <a>http://www.forumformusic.ie/print/Forum_IAPAsubmission.pdf--</a>&gt;</p>
<h3>Electronic Engineering and Computer Applications</h3>
<p><em>Electronic Engineering</em> and <em>Computer Applications</em> were among the first degree courses offered by the college, in 1980 (Communications was another). The Computer Applications course in DCU is more in demand than any other computer degree in Ireland, it has three times more first preferences through the <a>Central Applications Office</a> system than the next most sought after computer course in Ireland, Computer Science in <a>Trinity College, Dublin</a>. With 300 places per year, it also has the largest student intake of any computer science degree in Ireland (compared to 64 places per year in the computer science degree in <a>TCD</a> or 50 places per year in the computer science degree in <a>UCD</a>).</p>
<p>:<em>Note: Dublin City University uses the term &quot;computer applications&quot; in a way some consider to be rather broad. Computer Applications is normally a subset of computer science, but the subjects covered in the Computer Applications course DCU effectively make it a computer science course with a more practical, workplace-ready, slant, including an INTRA placement. DCU can afford to include the practical side of computer science because its courses are <a>semester</a>ized effectively allowing the college to fit more subject modules into a smaller time period.</em></p>

These are in addition to modern research and teaching laboratories in the areas of physics, chemistry, biology and engineering.</p>
<p>The university has a particularly strong research record, is sometimes described as a research-led university, and has regularly been recorded as bringing in more research income per members of faculty - or indeed as a percentage of total income - than any other university in Ireland. Its research team working on sensors at the <em>National Centre for Sensor Research</em> is considered one of the best in the world.</p>
<h3>Facilities</h3>
<p>There is an InterFaith Centre located on the campus, a cr&#x00e8;che, a medical centre, a Counselling Service, and a Disability Service.</p>
<p>Other social facilities include The Venue (Student Arts Theatre, aka omega[&#x03a9;], capacity:1000), a <a>Ticketmaster</a> outlet, a &quot;Digital Caf&#x00e9;&quot;, club and society meeting and seminar rooms, two <a>Starbucks</a>, one at the main restaurant (the first in Ireland) and one in the Sports Building, three pool rooms and a &quot;Glass Room&quot; for band practice.</p>
<p>There is also a campus company, Dublin City University Language Services, and a <a>VHI</a> Swiftcare Clinic.</p>
<p>Retail facilities include six restaurants and two bars, a <a>Spar</a> shop, <a>pharmacy</a>, <a>Barber</a>, Student's Union Shop, <a>Allied Irish Bank</a> branch, <a>Xerox</a> reprographic centre, <a>Hodges Figgis</a> bookshop,&lt;!--<a>Hodges Figgis</a> Alternate Link--&gt; a second-hand bookshop and a <a>beauty salon</a> in the sports centre.</p>
<h3>Culture and arts</h3>
<p>The <a>Centre for Talented Youth</a> and <a>The Helix</a> a purpose built &quot;performance space&quot;, which includes Ireland's largest concert hall, the Mahony Hall, are both part of the university.</p>
<p>DCU also has a campus radio station called DCUfm.</p>
<p>An Arts Committee was established in 1983 and has since acquired more than 300 works of art, including paintings, tapestries and sculptures, for the university. The Collection includes works by artists such as <a>Louis le Brocquy</a>, <a>Cecil King</a>, <a>Patrick Scott</a>, <a>Michael Warren</a>, <a>Stephen Lawlor</a>, <a>Brian Bourke</a>, <a>Victor Sloan</a>, <a>Barrie Cooke</a> and <a>William Crozier</a>, to name but a few.</p>
<h3>Entrepreneurship</h3>
<p>Dublin City University has a large number of graduate entrepreneurs and these form part of the DCU Alumni Entrepreneur Network which is run by the Alumni Office. Invent, the commercialisation gateway of DCU, is home to the Entrepreneurs' Organisation. It also hosts the Irish arm of the US-based National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship (<a>NFTE</a>), which helps young people from less well-off backgrounds to build skills and unlock creativity. The University launched the <a>eEolas Institute</a>, and its sole project, the Ryan Academy of Entrepreneurship, in Citywest Business Park, but this was reported as having closed in early 2008. Subsequently the Ryan Academy has been re-opened in the same location, under a new Director.</p>
<p>The new Ryan Academy for Entrepreneurship exists to promote entrepreneurship and innovation. The iconic building in Citywest is designed as a dynamic hub for entrepreneurs and researchers to develop ideas, learn new skills and network.  The Ryan Academy is working with researchers and entrepreneurs to help them achieve their potential. The Academy believes that the Social Economy will play a key role in Ireland&#x2019;s economic recovery and we are committed to providing leadership and support to this key sector. The Academy delivers short courses on a wide range of topics from Social Enterprise Development to Foresight and Future Trends. As well as for-profit entrepreneurship the Academy also works in the area of <a>social entrepreneurship</a> and social enterprise.</p>
<h3>Registration and application</h3>
<p>Most undergraduates enter DCU via the <a>Central Applications Office</a> process. DCU allows students to &quot;de-register&quot; and switch courses, this causes an artificially high non-completion rate (among the highest for the university sector), as the movement of these students (mainly first year undergraduates) into other courses within the university is not taken into account by university league tables.</p>
<p>The university recently completed an agreement with the <a>Postgraduate Applications Centre</a> in <a>Galway</a>.</p>
<h3>Corporate identity</h3>
<p>The university's current corporate identity dates from 2001 when the then new President decided to rebrand as he considered the previous &quot;three castles&quot; logo out of date and not representative of the university's vision as a modern and &quot;networked&quot; research university.</p>
<h3>Rankings</h3>
<p>The university was named <em>Irish University of the Year 2004-2005</em> by the <a>Sunday Times</a>, <a>UK</a>. It was also ranked No 2 in the league table of Irish universities in the same newspaper that year, and 4th in the two subsequent league tables.</p>
<p>The university is one of three establishments of higher education in the Republic of Ireland which are ranked amongst the top 300 universities worldwide by the <a>Times Higher Education Supplement</a>.</p>
<p>The university was also named best irish university for the 2010/2011 period.</p>
<h2>Organisation</h2>
<h3>Academic</h3>
<p>The academic organisation of the university is arranged into faculties and schools. DCU has recently undergone some reorganisation on the faculty level, with the School of Education Studies being incorporated into the School of Humanities and Social Science, and the School of Computing being incorporated into the engineering faculty. There are currently four faculties.</p>
<p>DCU houses on-campus the country's first purpose-built university nursing school. The University established was the first University in Ireland to establish a European <a>Master of Business Informatics</a> course.</p>
<p>The university hosts &quot;Oscail&quot;, the National Distance Education Centre. It is also the location for all professional <a>Actuarial</a> exams in the <a>Republic of Ireland</a>. It also has a <a>Prometric</a> Test Centre and is the test centre for Ireland's <a>Graduate Management Admission Test</a>.</p>
<p>There are also a number of independent colleges associated with the university, each of which has its own academic structures. The university started its first link with an external college in 1993, with an agreement with St Patrick's in nearby Drumcondra. Since then it has developed such activities, now validating courses and conferring diplomas and degrees at several colleges, three in north Dublin, three south of the Liffey. There are currently six linked institutions:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>All Hallows College</a></li>
  <li><a>Mater Dei Institute of Education</a></li>
  <li><a>St Patrick's College of Education</a></li>
  <li><a>Royal Irish Academy of Music</a></li>
  <li><a>The Gaiety School of Acting</a></li>
  <li><a>Turning Point</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>Controversy</h4>
<p>There has also been some controversy and litigation at the university over time.  Controversy began over the wording and adoption of new university statutes on suspension and dismissal of staff by the Governing Authority, on the recommendation of the president, as required by the Universities Act 1997. In 2002, the Labour Court recommended that this statute be rewritten  and this has been followed by long-running negotiations between the university and the trade union representing staff, SIPTU; In 2008 a vote organised by SIPTU led to a majority of staff who voted declaring no confidence in the management of the university in its conduct of these negotiations.</p>
<p>In 2002, a Rights Commissioner recommended re-instatement of a tenured lecturer following the university's decision to treat his employment as having been terminated on grounds that he had 'repudiated' his contract. Following a substantial  delay, an appeal from the Rights Commissioner's recommendation by the university commenced at the Employment Appeals Tribunal in July 2009 and continued in December 2009 and January 2010. During the hearing in 2009 there was significant emphasis on statements made by the lecturer in his blog throughout 2009, which were deemed by von Prondzynski and others to be highly defamatory.</p>
<p>There was further controversy surrounding accusations of gender discrimination against a female member of academic staff who won her case and appeal at Equality Appeals Tribunal.</p>
<p>There was also costly litigation following the purported termination by the university of the appointment of an associate professor in 2006, in which the High Court ruled against DCU on the grounds of failure to follow procedures, tenure and natural justice.  This case was appealed by the university and led to a 2009 Supreme Court hearing, in which judgment was reserved until 9 December 2009, with DCU again losing.</p>
<p>The president attracted criticism from some staff over his deferral of elections to the university Executive when it involved the candidacy of the purported dismissed academic, with von Prondzynski commenting that he could not see how the professor could become a member of the Executive advising him while at the same time stressing his openness to a range of views.</p>
<p>Members of the Green Party raised questions about management tactics in a labour dispute at the university when the party were in opposition, asking whether the university was in breach of the Universities Act, 1997.</p>
<h3>Governance</h3>
<p>In accordance with legislation, the University is directed by a policy-making Governing Body, whose functions are outlined in the National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin, Act, 1980, amended in the Dublin City University Act, 1989 which raised the institution's status to that of a university and provided for related matters. There are several other important acts concerning the college include the Universities Act, 1997, which allows for the creation of University Statutes.</p>
<p>The Governing Body's members are chosen by a wide range of groups and authorities, and include members elected by staff (in various classes) and students (ex-officio based on elections of Students Union officers). Graduates, who used to elect two members, now elect one member, and for some years there has been at least one other graduate member, put forward by the Educational Trust, at any time.</p>
<p>The university is headed, titularly, by the <a>Chancellor</a>. The current Chancellor of Dublin City University is <a>Ireland</a>'s former <a>EU Commission</a>er and <a>Attorney General</a>, <a>David Byrne</a>. He was preceded by the Hon Ms Justice <a>Mella Carroll</a> who in turn was preceded by Dr. <a>Tom Hardiman</a>.</p>
<h3>Academic Governance</h3>
<p>Academic Council and its Standing Committee oversee the teaching and research work of the university, and there are Faculty and other administrative structures below that. Most academic structures do have student representation.</p>
<h3>Executive Management</h3>
<p>The <a>President</a>, currently Professor Brian MacCraith, is the &quot;chief officer&quot; of the university, with a role sometimes compared to that of a <a>chief executive officer</a>.</p>
<p>Other elements of management include an Executive (Committee), the Deans (of Faculties, of Research and of Learning Innovation), Heads of School and Chairs of Programme Boards.</p>
<h3>Copyright Act</h3>
<p>The Copyright Act, 1963, as amended by the act of 1989, states that every university in the Republic of Ireland is entitled to one copy of every publication published within the state, and on this basis the Library of DCU can claim such copies.</p>
<h2>DCU Educational Trust</h2>
<p>The University is supported by a charitable Trust, named the &quot;DCU Educational Trust&quot;. The Trust, whose main work is in fund-raising, and which has a small staff, hosts the Alumni Association.</p>
<h2>Student activities</h2>
<p></p>
<h3>Clubs and societies</h3>
<p>There are a broad variety of clubs and societies, representing a wide range of interests such as <a>culture</a>, <a>computer games</a> and <a>sport</a> - as well as <a>academic</a> - interests, and numbering more than 100 in total.</p>
<h3>Governing Committees</h3>
<p>Societies and Clubs receive financial support from a proportion of capitation fees, and are governed solely by student committees. The Society Life Committee (SLC) and The Club Life Committee (CLC) governs and drives policy and funding for societies and clubs at DCU. DCU boasts excellent facilities for societies, mostly based in the Student Centre - The Hub.</p>
<h3>Arts</h3>
<h4>Drama</h4>
<p>DCU's Drama Society has a long history of performance on the DCU campus, hosting many productions for the public every year, including its annual flagship event, the DCU Musical. In 2009, DCU's musical, <a>RENT</a> , was nominated for the Best Overall Show award, and the Best Director award with the Association of Irish Musical Societies. DCU Drama reprised RENT at The Olympia, one of Dublin's oldest and most respected performance venues, in what was a first for an Irish University Society  from the 15th - 20 June 2009. DCU Drama also sends plays to be adjudicated for the Irish Student Drama Association awards. DCU Drama won the Best National College Society award at the Board of Irish College Societies awards in 2002, 2003 and 2008, as well as being nominated for Best Society Event in 2007 and 2009.</p>

<h2>Facilities</h2>
<h3>Accommodation</h3>
<p>In <a>Ireland</a>, on-campus accommodation in the newer universities is a relatively new innovation. Since the mid 1990s, all Irish universities have built up a stock of modern campus accommodation, although on-campus living is still the minority choice for students. Most accommodation is of <a>apartment</a> rather than <a>halls of residence</a> type and is managed by a University company, DCU Campus Residences.</p>
<p>The university has built several modern apartment and residences. Larkfield Apartments have 128 units, each with two study bedrooms and a shared living, kitchen and dining area within each unit. The Postgraduate Residences have 37 apartments, each with two, three or four en-suite bedrooms. The Hampstead Apartments consist of 61 units, each with three or five en-suite bedrooms and a shared living, kitchen and dining area. The College Park Apartments consist of 93 units, each with four or five en-suite bedrooms and a shared living, kitchen and dining area.</p>

Membership of the Sports Academy will entitle those selected to special scholarships and supports worth up to <a>&#x20ac;</a>10,000 each including on-campus accommodation, financial support towards college books and tuition fees, personal tuition, access to key national and International competitions, physiotherapy and massage, sports nutrition advice and high performance education talks and workshops.</p>
<h3>Library</h3>
<p>DCU has always had a dedicated library and as a <a>deposit library</a>, it is entitled legally to a copy of every book published in the <a>Republic of Ireland</a>.</p>
<p>The <a>O'Reilly Foundation</a> made a substantial contribution towards the new library building, <em>The John and Aileen O<code>Reilly Library</code></em> . The building was designed by the Scott, Tallon, Walker architecture firm.</p>
<p>Library users can avail of photocopying, printing and scanning facilities, access newspapers and journals, read microfilms, watch videos and DVDs and access the internet. Dedicated laptop network points and wireless network access are available on three floors of the library.</p>
<p>DCU library is part of the <a>IReL</a> (Irish Research E-Library) consortium, allowing staff and students full access to over 100 academic databases.</p>
<p>In November 2008, DCU Library launched <a>DORAS</a>, an <a>open access</a> <a>institutional repository</a>, to promote the university's research by providing free online access to DCU's research publications and theses.</p>
<h3>Other</h3>
<p>There are three <a>licensed premises</a> on the campus, also selling a wide selection of food; the &quot;nu bar&quot; (aka beta [&#x03b2;]), <a>The Helix</a> and Spar (off-license). However, in early 2007 Spar stopped selling any alcoholic products indefinitely, and it remains to be seen whether or not they will renew their licence in the future. Prior to this there were four licenced premises, but this itself followed a long period with only one licenced location, and up until 1992, there were no such premises on campus at all.</p>
<p>There are several restaurants and cafes; the Main Restaurant and the first <a>Starbucks</a> (in Ireland) are located in the Pavilion building. Zero-1 is located in the basement of the O<code>Reilly Library. The Invent Centre, The Helix, Nursing School and Business School each have their own restaurants. The 1838 Club is a restaurant for academic staff and postgraduate research students, it is located in the <a>Albert College</a> Building. There is a second <a>Starbucks</a> located in the Sports Complex, the third in Ireland after <a>Microsoft</a> Ireland. There is also a digital cafe and Xbox gaming arena above the main restaurant, The Mezzanine. In 2009 the Mezzanine is in the process of relocation to the seminar room in DCU's student centre 'The Hub'</code></p>
<p>DCU has recently acquired additional lands adjacent to its main campus, which will be developed to add on to the University's sports facilities.</p>
<p>DCU plans to build a 10,000 seat indoor stadium and running track at its Sports Grounds.</p>
<p>DCU has launched an <a>affinity credit card scheme</a> to raise funds for the University, as well as the Annual Fund, which includes facilities for regular donors, and the Leadership Circle which gives recognition to regular donors who commit minimum annual amounts.</p>
<p>It is planned that the university will have &#x2018;stop&#x2019; on the &#x2018;<a>Metro North</a>&#x2019; line which is to be completed by 2016.</p>

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>In 2001 DCU adopted what was described as a highly innovative strategic plan, 'Leading Change'. For a university strategy, it was a very short document, but it set out a number of major developments and innovations. Chief amongst these was the adoption of academic strategic 'Themes', which were to govern the development of the university. Each Theme was to have a 'Theme Leader'. The academic Themes are interdisciplinary, and focus on areas in which DCU has growing leadership. This strategic framework was extended in the 2005 strategic plan, 'Leadership through Foresight', in which DCU also committed itself to eight key clusters of actions to develop its leading role in its chosen priority areas. Following an announcement by the <a>HEA</a> in August 2007, DCU will receive over &#x20ac;23m in research funding under Phase 2 of <a>PRTLI</a> Cycle 4.</p>
<p>Following an announcement by the <a>Science Foundation Ireland</a> in November 2007, DCU will receive over &#x20ac;16.8m in research funding for localisation research for a &#x20ac;30.4m &quot;Next Generation Localisation&quot; project headed by Prof. Josef Van Genabith (with international and domestic industry partners contributing the remaining &#x20ac;13.6m).</p>
<h3>Collaboration and academic associations</h3>
<p>Under its strategic plan, 'Leadership through Foresight' (2005), DCU is committed to collaboration with national and international organisations and universities on technology and research projects.
