<h2>History and tradition</h2>
<h3>History</h3>
<p>[[Image:Bellarmine 3.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[St. Robert Bellarmine|St. Robert Bellarmine, S.J.]], <a>Patron Saint</a> of Fairfield University]]</p>
<p>Fairfield University was founded in 1942 by the <a>Society of Jesus</a> when the Jesuits acquired the two contiguous estates of the Jennings and Lashar families. In the same year the <a>Rev. James H. Dolan, S.J.</a>, the Provincial Superior of the New England Jesuit Province appointed the <a>Rev. John J. McEleney, S.J.</a> the first President of the &quot;Fairfield University of <a>Saint Robert Bellarmine, S.J.</a>&quot; and Vicar of the <a>Fairfield College Preparatory School</a>. In 1944, the Rev. James H. Dolan, S.J. became the second President. During his tenure, Fairfield University was chartered by the State of Connecticut to grant degrees in 1945; the first class of 303 male students was admitted to the College of Arts and Sciences in 1947; the College of Arts and Sciences was accredited by the State of Connecticut and the first summer session of undergraduate courses was held in 1949.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In 1971, Fairfield University won a significant legal victory at the <a>Supreme Court of the United States</a> in <em>Tilton vs. Richardson</em> establishing an important legal precedent concerning the <a>Establishment Clause of the First Amendment</a> and government financial assistance to religious-based colleges and universities.  This landmark court case questioned the legality of Fairfield and three other Connecticut religious-based institutions securing federal construction grants under the Higher Education Facilities Act of 1963. An appeal by the plaintiffs was denied by the Supreme Court on June 28, 1971, ensuring Fairfield a significant amount of federal money which contributed to the construction of the <a>Nyselius Library</a> (1968) and Bannow Science Center (1971). In the majority opinion, the Court upheld, 5-4, the federal construction grants as long as the facilities were not to be used for sectarian instruction or places of worship.  Further, a brief history of <strong>The Jesuits in Fairfield</strong> can be found on The Fairfield Jesuit Community website.</p>
<p>During the <a>American Revolutionary War</a> in 1779, the &quot;Battle of Round Hill&quot; took place on the present day Bellarmine Hill on the campus of the university where the Americans under the command of Colonel Samuel Whiting (whose third-generation grandson Andrew Whiting graduated in 2005) repelled the British invaders under the command of Major-General <a>William Tryon</a>, but not before the British laid ruin to the Town of Fairfield.</p>
<h3>Recent history</h3>
<p>In September 2000, <a>Charles F. Dolan H'04</a>, founder of <a>HBO</a> and chairman of <a>Cablevision</a>, donated $25 million to the renamed <a>Charles F. Dolan School of Business</a>, which still represents one of the largest donations from a single source to a <a>business school</a>.</p>
<p>In July 2004, the <a>Rev. Jeffrey P. von Arx, S.J.</a>, a graduate of <a>Princeton University</a>, former Chair of the History Department at <a>Georgetown University</a>, and former Dean of <a>Fordham College at Rose Hill</a>, became the eighth Jesuit President of Fairfield University succeeding the <a>Rev. Aloysius P. Kelley, S.J.</a>, the longest tenured and most accomplished President of the University.</p>
<p><a>thumb|right|300px|Aloysius P. Kelley, S.J. Center</a></p>
<p>In September 2004, the <a>Rev. Jeffrey P. von Arx, S.J.</a> announced that the capital campaign, &quot;Our Promise: The Campaign for Fairfield University,&quot; launched and led by the <a>Rev. Aloysius P. Kelley, S.J.</a>, raised a record $137.9 million. The capital raised resulted in the construction and renovation of seven buildings, the creation of four new academic chairs, and the significant increase in the University's endowment.</p>
<p>In October 2006, the <a>Rev. Jeffrey P. von Arx, S.J.</a>, the <a>Rev. Aloysius P. Kelley, S.J.</a>, and Paul J. Huston '82, chairman of the Board of Trustees, dedicated the Aloysius P. Kelley. S.J. Center, a new <a>environmentally friendly</a>, state-of-the-art welcoming center for prospective students and a &quot;one-stop shopping&quot; administrative center for current students.</p>
<p>In March 2008, the <a>Rev. Jeffrey P. von Arx, S.J.</a>, announced the Bridgeport Tuition Plan offering full tuition scholarships to admitted students who are graduates of a <a>Bridgeport, Connecticut high school</a> whose family earns less than $50,000 a year.</p>
<h3>Roman Catholic and Jesuit tradition</h3>
<p>As one of 28 Jesuit colleges and universities in the United States, Fairfield belongs to an elite group that continues the dedication <a>Saint Ignatius of Loyola</a> (1491&#x2013;1556)  to developing the whole person. The university's   environment invites students of all traditions to a maturing of faith, self knowledge, respect for the dignity of themselves and others, a devotion to justice, a commitment to serving the poor, and a passion for truth, reflection, and lifelong learning.</p>

<h3>Seal of the University</h3>
<p><a>frame|left</a> Fairfield's seal combines elements of its several traditions. The gold pinecones come from the coat of arms of the family of <a>Saint Robert Bellarmine, S.J.</a>, for whom the university was originally named. Superimposed on the cones is the badge of the <a>Society of Jesus</a> - the letters IHS surmounted by the cross and surrounded by the instruments of Christ's passion - to indicate that the University is in the care of members of the same religious family.</p>
<p>There are three compartments in the upper portion of the shield, because &quot;the school is dedicated and exists in the name of the father, and of the son, and of the holy spirit.&quot; The central compartment portrays a hart crossing a ford, a part of the coat of arms of the <a>Diocese of Hartford</a>, whose boundaries encompassed the <a>Town of Fairfield</a>, when the University was founded. Finally, the two outer compartments show clusters of grapes, charges taken from the town seal and symbolic of the fertility of the verdant fields of the Town and County of Fairfield. When the University was founded in 1942, the official name of the University was &quot;Fairfield University of St. Robert Bellarmine&quot;. Three of the original seals with this name still exist on campus - in the main lobby of Alumni Hall, on the exterior of the Barone Campus Center, and on the glass front of Regis Hall facing the Quad.</p>

During the years of 2000, 2001, 2005, 2006 and 2007, the team was nationally ranked, rising as high as #15 in several polls. In 2007, the Men's Soccer team defeated national champion St. John's University 2-1. No other Fairfield   athletic program has ever defeated a former National Championship team.</p>
<p>On March 13, 2010, <a>men's lacrosse</a> set the school record for the defeat of the highest ranked opponent when the Stags upset the then no. 3 nationally ranked (and eventual <a>2010 NCAA tournament runner-up</a>) <a>Notre Dame Fighting Irish</a> 10-8 while competing in the inaugural 'Beating Cancer With A Stick Classic' at <a>The Kinkaid School</a> in <a>Houston, Texas</a>.</p>
<p>On March 16, 2010, during the first round of the 2010 <a>CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament</a> (CIT) <a>men's basketball</a> set the national record for the largest comeback in division I college basketball postseason history by overcoming a 27-point deficit with under 16 minutes to play to defeat <a>George Mason</a> in overtime, 101-96. The Stags were led by Mike Evanovich who finished with a career-high 32 points and a school record nine three-pointers including one with 0.9 seconds in regulation to send the game into overtime.</p>
<h3>Sport clubs</h3>
<p>Sport Clubs offer a competitive athletic opportunity for students including baseball, equestrian, men's and women's ice hockey, martial arts, men's and women's rugby, sailing, men's and women's skiing and snowboarding, men's and women's soccer, men's and women's track and <a>men's</a> and women's volleyball. The <strong>Equestrian Club</strong> was Regional Champions in 1996, 1997, 1999, 2000, 2002, &amp; 2003 and in 2007 seven Fairfield riders were invited to the elite Tournament of Champions, a horse show for the nation's top collegiate <a>equestrian</a> teams. The <strong>Men's Hockey Club</strong> (formerly an NCAA level Division I program of the now-defunct MAAC) competed in the 2007 <a>MCHC</a> Championship game and the 2008 <a>ACHA</a> National Tournament.  The <strong><a>Men's Rugby Football Club</a></strong> or <strong>Red Ruggers</strong>, established in 1963, is the longest continuously running sport club at Fairfield University.  The Red Ruggers won the 2008 <a>MET NY Rugby Football Union</a> Division II Title and have produced two <a>USA Rugby</a> Collegiate All-Americans, one <a>USA Eagle</a> who competed in the <a>1991 Rugby World Cup</a> and one <a>USA Tomahawk</a>.  The <a><strong>Men's Volleyball Club</strong></a> won the 2006 and 2007 New England Collegiate Volleyball League Division II Championship and competed in the 2001, 2002, 2005, 2006 and 2008 National Intramural-Recreational Sports Association (NIRSA) Volleyball Championships.  Historically, the 1979 <strong>Football Club</strong> led by All-America quarterback Craig Leach '81 played in the National Collegiate Football Association's championship game where the Stags fell 60&ndash;40 to the University of Massachusetts-Lowell. The 1980 Football Club started the season ranked #1 in the pre-season NCFA Polls.  The men's club baseball team was officially recognized as a sports club during the 2007-2008 academic year.  The team competes in the New England Club Baseball Association.</p>
<h2>Campus and region</h2>
<p>The university is situated on a pastoral campus offering scenic views of <a>Long Island Sound</a> and all the amenities of a major, comprehensive university in a setting of rolling hills, sprawling lawns, picturesque ponds, and bucolic wooded areas-a setting ideal for education.  Fairfield's  campus consists of 35 buildings anchored by the three manor homes of the original estates: Bellarmine Hall (1921), formerly the Lashar's 'Hearthstone Hall', re-named to honor <a>Saint Robert Bellarmine, S.J</a>,; McAuliffe Hall (1896), originally O.G. Jennings' 'Mailands', re-named for Bishop <a>Maurice F. McAuliffe</a>, who sanctioned the creation of Fairfield University; and David J. Dolan House, Lawrence Jenning's 'Larribee', dedicated to honor the uncle of <a>Charles F. Dolan</a> who made the 1989 acquisition of Dolan Campus possible.  Along with Bellarmine Hall, named in honor of <a>Saint Robert Bellarmine, S.J</a>, many of the buildings on the campus   are named in honor of Jesuit priests. Behind each building name is a story of a Jesuit priest who was an exemplar of the Jesuit mission and their pursuit of educational and intellectual contributions, human rights and social justice. </p>
<h3>Campus safety</h3>
<p>The univesity received the 2008 <a>Jeanne Clery</a> Campus Safety Award, presented each year by Security On Campus Inc. (SOC). The national award, established in 1994 by Howard and Connie Clery in memory of their daughter who was murdered on a college campus in 1986, honors schools and individuals &#x201c;that have done extraordinary things to make college and university students safer.&#x201d; Fairfield was selected for the award based on &quot;...its innovative programs, comprehensive emergency response plan, and overall commitment to...peer education and prevention programming, and a unique study abroad travel safety program.&quot;</p>
<h3>DiMenna-Nyselius Library</h3>
<p><a>thumb|300px|left|DiMenna-Nyselius Library</a> Built in 1968, the <a>DiMenna-Nyselius Library</a> originally was named the Nyselius Library in honor of benefactors Gustav and Dagmar Nyselius. They were Swedish immigrants who had settled in Stamford and wanted to make a donation to Fairfield University to repay in part the kindness of their adoptive country. In 2001, the Library underwent a major renovation and expansion and was renamed the DiMenna-Nyselius Library in recognition of a   donation from alumnus Joseph A. DiMenna, Jr. '80.  </p>
<p>The Library contains an extensive   collection of <a>print</a> and <a>electronic resources</a> which include over 300,000 bound volumes, 1800 <a>journals</a> and <a>newspapers</a>, over 11,000 <a>audiovisual</a> items and the equivalent of 92,000 volumes in <a>microform</a>. Its electronic resources provide online access to a wide variety of <a>World Wide Web</a> subscription databases that bring full text journals and statistical information to the desktop anywhere on campus. Throughout the Library, <a>wireless access</a> is available in designated areas. The Library also contains two open access computer labs featuring <a>Macintosh</a> and <a>Dell</a> <a>computers</a> (one with 24-hour access for students), two dozen <a>multimedia</a> <a>workstations</a>, an <a>electronic classroom</a>, a 90-seat <a>multimedia</a> <a>auditorium</a>, and study rooms.</p>
<p>In March 2010, a strong <a>Nor'easter</a> storm peeled back a roughly 120<a>&#x2019;</a> x 30-40&#x2019; section of the roof along the parking lot side of the library building, destroying 2,583 books&#x2014;some of which were out of print. The worst-damaged sections were the ones on Shakespeare, film, modern languages, science and social science. The minimum estimated value of the books was $88,519.41.</p>
<h3>Environmental Sustainability</h3>
<p>In recent years, the university has implemented an institution-wide Green Movement, taking major steps to reduce its impact on the <a>natural environment</a> and improve <a>sustainability</a>.   The univesity now builds facilities with an eye to <a>energy efficiency</a>, <a>recycling</a>, and receives high marks from <a>Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design</a> (LEED), a rating system of the <a>U.S. Green Building Council</a> that promotes responsible building practices and <a>sustainable design</a>. These efforts have earned the university recognition as one of the nation's &quot;Cool Schools&quot; from the <a>Sierra Club</a> and a &quot;C-&quot; grade on the Sustainable Endowments Institute's 2009 College Sustainability Report Card.  And in 2010, the Princeton Review and U.S. Green Building Council included Fairfield   in the &quot;Guide to 286 Green Colleges&quot; </p>
<p>In October 2007, <a>U.S. Secretary of Energy Samuel Bodman</a> and <a>U.S. Representative Christopher Shays</a> joined the <a>Rev. Jeffrey P. von Arx, S.J.</a> in unveiling the University's new <a>environmentally friendly</a> <a>Combined Heat and Power Plant</a> (CHP) designed to reduce strain on the region's <a>power grid</a> and reduce the University's overall <a>carbon footprint</a> by more than 10,000 <a>metric tons</a> per year.  The <a>United States Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) honored the univesity with a 2010 <a>Energy Star</a> CHP Award for its energy smart CHP.</p>
<p>In May 2008, the <a>Rev. Jeffrey P. von Arx, S.J.</a> signed the American College &amp; University Presidents Climate Commitment, a high-visibility effort to address <a>global warming</a> by garnering institutional commitments to neutralize <a>greenhouse gas emissions</a>, and to accelerate the research and educational efforts of higher education to equip society to re-stabilize the Earth's <a>climate</a>.</p>
<p>On <a>Earth Day</a> 2008, a ground breaking took place for the new Fairfield Jesuit Community Center, an <a>environmentally friendly</a> home and retreat and meeting center that will feature a <a>roof garden</a> and a <a>geo-thermal heating and cooling system</a>.  Fairfield is also in the process of replacing its 125-vehicle fleet with <a>biodiesel-powered buses</a> and <a>hybrid vehicles</a>.</p>
<p>Most recently, in August 2009, Fairfield University became the first university in the United States to install <a>Tomra</a> <a>UNO reverse vending machines (RVM)</a>, an all-in-one recycling machine, allowing students to deposit plastic, glass and aluminum beverage containers for a rebate of a nickel.</p>

<h3>Region</h3>
<p>The <a>Town of Fairfield</a> was rated the ninth &quot;best place to live&quot; in the United States and the best place to live in the Northeast by <a>Money Magazine</a> offering students <a>Fairfield Beach</a> along the scenic shoreline of <a>Long Island Sound</a> and a vibrant downtown area which are both located just five minutes from campus.  The University runs a shuttle between campus and downtown where students can catch a dinner and a <a>movie</a> or hop on a <a>Metro-North Train</a> bound for <a>Grand Central Station</a> and <a>New York City</a>.</p>
<p>The <a>Black Rock</a> neighborhood of the <a>City of Bridgeport</a> bordering on the <a>Town of Fairfield</a> is located just ten minutes from campus and provides students a metropolitan village-like atmosphere that boasts some of the best restaurants and entertainment in <a>Fairfield County</a>.  Fairfield University students frequent the &quot;Acoustic Cafe&quot; which has been named &quot;Best Place to Hear Alternative Music&quot; three years in a row by Fairfield County Weekly's reader poll and helped launch Fairfield University's own award-winning <a>Indie rock</a> band, <a>The Alternate Routes</a>.</p>

<h2>Residence life</h2>
<h3>Residence halls</h3>
<p><a>thumb|left|300px|John C. Dolan Hall</a> Fairfield University guarantees first year students four years of campus housing and provides several housing options depending on their class. Most underclassman live on campus and live the typical <a>residence hall</a> life in the <strong>Quad</strong> or <strong>The Orient</strong> sections of campus. <strong>The Quad</strong> is located in the northwest corner of campus and consists of Campion Hall, Joques Hall, Gonzaga Hall, Loyola Hall, and Regis Hall. Students typically choose to live in The Quad in order to be close to the classroom buildings and to enjoy the annual battle of dorms water fights; and frisbee and wiffleball games during the warm weather. <strong>The Orient</strong> is located in the southeast corner of campus and consists of Kostka Hall and Claver Hall which is suite style living, and also the apartments, the newest on campus housing. This section earned its name due to its woodsy seclusion from the main area of campus. <strong>Dolan Hall</strong> is located in the northeast corner of campus is the primary residence hall for students who request to live in singles housing. This building also holds some freshman doubles.</p>
<h3>Residential Colleges</h3>
<p>Loyola Hall is home to the <strong>Ignatian Residential College</strong>, which offers a unique <a>residential college</a> experience for Fairfield sophomores. Funded by a $2 million grant from the <a>Lilly Endowment</a>, the program provides over 200 students with the opportunity to study and live together while pondering questions of identity, faith and purpose. In addition to living together and taking two classes together students meet once per month in groups of ten with a mentor, hear from weekly speakers, attend one overnight retreat per semester, and take cultural trips.</p>
<p>St. Ignatius House, the former Jesuit community house, will be home to the <strong>Just-Us Residential College</strong>. The program will allow up to 140 sophomores,   committed to community service and social justice, to go beyond the small community service groups at Campus Ministry and live with a group of individuals concerned with life outside of Fairfield County. The program is not inherently religious, but should attract students of all faiths, races and socioeconomic backgrounds who want to do something to help the Fairfield community and beyond.</p>
<h3>Upperclassmen alternatives</h3>
<p><a>thumb|right|300px|Clam Jam at Fairfield Beach, 1997</a> Upperclassmen   choose between living at the  Townhouse Complex ,  the Apartment Village, or <a>Fairfield Beach</a>. The 10 unit  Townhouse Complex is a series of 104 two-story student townhouses for 469 juniors and seniors. There are between five and seven students living in each townhouse which has two or three bedrooms upstairs, a living and dining area, a kitchen and two bathrooms. In 2007, townhouse basements have been closed off to students, after an incident in which the administration and Fairfield fire department deemed the basements a fire hazard. During the warmer weather students enjoy their back porches and lawns with an occasional barbecue and wiffleball game. The  Apartment Village   was opened in September 2000. These apartment-style residences house 192 juniors and seniors. Each apartment contains four single bedrooms, two full bathrooms, a kitchen and a living room.   Fairfield Beach is  a unique Fairfield living experience for 200 eligible students to rent beach houses along the Long Island Sound. It historically has been the center of off-campus social life hosting such Fairfield traditions as the Clam Jam and Mock Weddings. However, as it  has evolved from a part-time summer beach community into a more permanent residential community, Fairfield Beach has become a source of strain on town-gown relations leading to greater controls over student social life including a ban on large gatherings at Lantern Point since 2001 due to a court injunction.<img></p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<h3>Community service</h3>
<p>The goal of Jesuit education is <em>homines pro aliis</em>, &#x201c;men and women for others&#x201d;. As a result, Fairfield students are involved in many <a>community service</a> opportunities.  Fairfield was among just 119 colleges in the nation named to the Carnegie Classification for Community Engagement in 2008.  Further, the University was named to the 2009 President's Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll by the <a>Learn and Serve America</a> Program of the <a>Corporation for National and Community Service</a>.</p>
<p>Locally, the award-winning <strong>Annual Hunger Clean Up</strong> is a one-day service-a-thon where the entire university community joins together to work at 40-plus local agency sites throughout Fairfield County  and to raise money for local and national <a>hunger</a> and <a>homelessness</a> causes.  The Fairfield chapter of <strong>Colleges Against Cancer</strong> hosts an annual <a>American Cancer Society</a> <a>Relay for Life</a>, an overnight event designed to spread awareness of <a>cancer</a> prevention, treatments and cures, celebrate <a>cancer survivors</a> and raise money for <a>cancer research</a>.  The <strong><a>Adrienne Kirby Family Literacy Project</a></strong>, recognized as a model program by the <a>Corporation for National and Community Service</a>, involves about 175 Fairfield student-volunteers a year in providing individual tutoring to preschool children  at the Action for Bridgeport Community Development's <a>Early Learning/Head Start Program</a>. <a>Mexico</a>, <a>Jamaica</a>, <a>Belize</a> and <a>Haiti</a>.  In 2004, Mikaela Conley '06 and Aamina Awan '07 founded <strong>The Afghan Children's Project</strong> to raise awareness and funds for children who have suffered the effects of war, violence, and poverty in the heart of <a>Afghanistan</a>.  Both were interviewed on <a>CNN Daybreak</a> in August 2005 for their work in funding the building of a <a>water well</a> for Aloudine, a small village outside <a>Kabul</a>, desperate for clean drinking water.  And in 2008, nine Fairfield students, inspired by 2006 <a>Nobel Peace Prize</a> recipient <a>Muhammad Yunus</a> and the <a>Grameen Bank</a>, started <strong>Sustainable Equity for Women</strong>, a <a>micro-lending</a> project designed to raise and invest money in small businesses run by women in <a>developing countries</a> in conjunction with <a>Kiva Microfunds</a>.</p>
<h3>Diversity</h3>
<p>In total, the   student body hails from 32 states, <a>Washington, D.C.</a>, <a>Puerto Rico</a>, the <a>U.S. Virgin Islands</a>, and 45 foreign countries. 13% of undergraduate students are <a>African American</a>, <a>Hispanic</a>, <a>Asian American</a>, <a>Native American</a> (<a>AHANA</a>), or <a>multiracial</a>. Valuing a mix of experiences in the classroom and on campus, increasing <a>diversity</a> at Fairfield is a major goal of the University's Strategic Vision, and in 2005, during the University's <a>Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Holiday Celebration and Convocation</a>, the <a>Rev. Jeffrey P. von Arx, S.J.</a>, called on the university   to join him in efforts to increase <a>diversity</a> at the institution.  For this reason, the <strong>Office of Institutional Diversity Initiatives</strong> and the <strong>Office of Student Diversity Programs</strong> were created to pursue a number of initiatives to increase <a>racial</a> and <a>socioeconomic</a> <a>diversity</a>. These <a>diversity</a> initiatives are helped annually by the Fairfield Awards Dinner held in <a>New York City</a> in which funds are raised for <strong>The Alumni Multicultural Scholarship Fund</strong>. The 2008 Fairfield Awards Dinner raised a record-breaking $1.1 million. <a>thumb|left|300px|John A. Barone Campus Center</a></p>
<h3>Fairfield University Student Association</h3>
<p>The Fairfield University Student Association (FUSA) is the official student association for full-time undergraduate students and is the largest student organization on campus.  The association exists to represent student issues and concerns to the faculty and administration and to sponsor a multitude of student programs and activities. All full-time undergraduate students are members. The association is organized into three branches &#x2013;  legislative', executive, and  judicial. The  legislative branch  consists of the <strong>Student Senate</strong>, comprising 40 elected representatives (10 from each undergraduate class year). The  executive branch  is headed by the popularly elected  President  of FUSA, who serves as the official spokesperson for undergraduate students in addition to administering the student association on a daily basis. In 2002, Karen Donoghue '03 became the first women elected President of FUSA. The FUSA President is assisted by a popularly elected Vice President, elected class officers, and a number of other appointed officers, including the Executive Director of Programming and the Executive Director of Clubs &amp; Organizations. The  judicial branch,  known as the Student Court,  serves as a hearing body in certain student conduct cases, as well as performing the judicial functions required for the student association.</p>
<h3>Student activism</h3>
<p>A central tenet of a <a>Jesuit</a> education is the promotion of the <a>values</a> of <a>peace</a> and <a>social justice</a>.  Fairfield University students have embraced and reflected these values in their own <a>student activism</a>. In 1988, 1989 and 1990, the <strong>Coalition for a Better World</strong> constructed &quot;Cardboard City&quot; and held a 36 hour vigil,  and again in 2008, the <strong>Students for Social Justice</strong> similarly constructed &quot;Homeless Village&quot; and hosted the <a>&quot;Oxfam Hunger Banquet&quot;</a> to raise awareness of the plight of the <a>homeless</a> in the United States.  In 1999, students staged an 11-hour sit-in at the home of the university president and later a <a>hunger strike</a> to protest a contracting company used by the university that the students said was anti-union and paid janitors poorly.  Each year, the Students for Social Justice travel to <a>Columbus, Georgia</a> for the annual <a>School of the Americas Watch</a> protest at a combat training school for Latin American soldiers now known as the <a>Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation</a>. The date of the protest marks the anniversary of the murder of six <a>Jesuit</a> priests, their maid, and her daughter in <a>El Salvador</a> at the hands of soldiers trained at the School of the Americas.  And in 2008, <strong>Fairfield for Peace NOW</strong> created &quot;Hope Trail&quot;, a pathway of flags around campus symbolizing the cost in life and casualties from the <a>Iraq War</a>, and &quot;A Cry For Peace&quot;, a play written and performed with Theatre Fairfield demonstrating the toll of the <a>Iraq War</a> on the families of soldiers back in the United States.</p>
<h3>Student clubs &amp; organizations</h3>
<p>All student clubs and organizations comprise the Student Organization Board of Governors (SOBOG), which is governed by a board of governors and administered by a chairperson selected by members of student organizations. SOBOG exists to encourage student involvement and participation in approximately 80 clubs and organizations each year including the Glee Club, Jazz Ensemble, Pep Band, Dance Team, Stag in the Stands, Habitat for Humanity, Asian Student Association, mission volunteer trips, and Theater Fairfield. The oldest club on campus is the <a>Fairfield University Glee Club</a> which celebrated its 60th anniversary in 2007. The Fairfield University Debate Team of Jason LaRue '99 and Courtney Darts '01 won first place at the 1998 Columbia University <a>Parliamentary Debate Tournament</a> beating 69 other teams, including teams from Harvard, Johns Hopkins, Princeton, Yale and Williams.</p>
