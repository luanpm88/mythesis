<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Baptists first sent missionaries to southwestern Manitoba in 1869 and settlers began to arrive in the area after 1871. Both settlers and missionaries soon saw a need for a denominational college for Manitoba youth and several attempts to found a college were made. In 1880, Dr. John Crawford and Rev. G. B. Davis opened Prairie College in Rapid City, 20 miles north of Brandon. The College failed and Rev. Davis founded a small academy in Rapid City that was subsequently taken over by his brother-in-law, Prof. S. J. McKee. McKee&#x2019;s Academy was moved to Brandon in 1890 following the projection of the CPR mainline through the Assiniboine Valley that resulted in the marked growth of the city of Brandon</p>
<h3>Brandon College</h3>
<p>As early as 1885 the Baptist Convention of Manitoba and the Northwest Territories responded to this need. Brandon College was established in Brandon, Man, in 1889 by the Baptist Union of Western Canada, and was affiliated with <a>McMaster University</a>. In 1898 a Toronto industrialist, Mr. William Davies, and his sister-in-law, Mrs. Emily Davies, pledged $25,000 to be used to establish a Baptist College in Brandon. Plans moved ahead rapidly. </p>
<p>The Convention appointed Dr. A. P. McDiarmid as principal of Brandon College in 1899. Prof. McKee&#x2019;s Academy was merged into the new institution and the quarters of the Academy in the Stewart Black on Rosser Avenue at Ninth Street continued to be used. On July 13, 1900, Mrs. Davies laid the cornerstone of the first new building located at the corner of 18th Street and Lorne Avenue, part of the present campus. The Brandon Bell and was named after Brandon Bell II, the principal donor. These now serve as the administration buildings of Brandon University. <a>thumb|right|Clark Hall</a> Brandon College, built 1900-01 and the adjoining Clark Hall (1905&#x2013;06) a 3&#x00bd;-storey brick and stone complex are on the Registry of Historic Places of Canada  Brandon College was a liberal arts college offering some work in theology, a high school department, and a commercial department. A school of music was added in 1906. </p>
<p>When the Baptist Church withdrew its support in 1938 for financial reasons, the college became non-denominational.</p>
<h3>Brandon University</h3>
<p>In 1967 it attained university status and became Brandon University by the Brandon University Act. Brandon University received its charter on June 5, 1967, on the occasion of the visit of Her Royal Highness Princess Alexandra and the Honourable Angus Ogilvie. Brandon University currently has enrolment of 3,098 and a faculty of 220 (September 30, 2002). The Education Building was opened in 1967 and the Western Manitoba Centennial Auditorium in 1969. A ten story, high-rise residence, McMaster Hall, for men and women, was opened in the fall of 1971. The Jeff Umphrey Memorial Centre for Mental Retardation opened in the fall of 1971 and housed a bookstore, bank, and a day centre as well as the research centre on mental disability.</p>
<p>The J. R. Brodie Science Centre was opened officially in May 1972, although classes were held there during the 1971-72 school year. There are facilities for the departments of chemistry, physics, botany, zoology, geology, geography, mathematics and computer science, and psychology. In early 1980, the Master of Music Degree Program was approved and in September 1980, the Applied Program commenced. The Master of Music (Education) commenced in September 1981. In November 1983, a sod-turning ceremony was held initiating the beginning of the new Music Building erected to the south of the Western Manitoba Centennial Auditorium and west of the Arts and Library Building. In October, 1984, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II officially named the structure the &#x201c;Queen Elizabeth II Music Building&#x201d;. Members of the Music faculty moved into the new building during the summer of 1985 and classes were held there in the fall.</p>
<p>In September 1986, classes commenced in the Department of Nursing and Health Studies program with 2-Year Post-Diploma Baccalaureate Degrees in Nursing and Mental Health. In 1990, the University introduced a major in Business Administration in the Faculty of Arts. Brandon University received its second masters program when the Masters of Education program was approved in 1990. In 1991, a minor in Women&#x2019;s Studies was approved in the Faculty of Arts. In 1993, a minor in Aboriginal Art was approved. In September 1996, the 4-Year Bachelor of Science in Psychiatric Nursing was offered for the first time. Beginning in the fall of 1994, the renovation and reconstruction of Clark Hall and the Brandon College Building, with the retention of the original fa&#x00e7;ade, was initiated. This historic project was completed in the spring of 1997. Currently, faculty and administration occupy the new structure and classes are being held in the new large classrooms in the renovated buildings. In 1997, the School of Health Studies was established and the 4-Year Bachelor of Business Administration was offered for the first time. In 1998, both a Masters program in Rural Development and a bachelor&#x2019;s program in First Nations and Aboriginal Counselling was launched.</p>
<p>In 1999, the University celebrated its centennial with the community at-large. To mark the occasion, both university and community members helped to excavate Prairie College, the university&#x2019;s original Baptist site. The Applied Disaster and Emergency Studies program that adopts a Liberal Arts and Science approach to foster an appreciation for the interdisciplinary nature of this field was initiated in the fall of 2001. May 2002 marked the sod-turning ceremony for the new Health Studies Complex that celebrated its grand opening on September 19, 2003. The new building currently houses the School of Health Studies and the First Nations and Aboriginal Counselling program. The Health Studies Complex was uniquely designed to include a large round room equipped for holding traditional ceremonies performed by First Nations and Metis students.</p>
<p>The Bachelor of Environmental Science program, approved in December 2002, was implemented in September 2003. In May 2003, the Manitoba Council On Post Secondary Education (COPSE) approved the four-year Creative Arts program and in June approved the Bachelor of Fine Arts Program. Both programs commenced in the fall of 2003. In September 2005, COPSE approved the expansion of Brandon University's Rural and Community Studies Program to include four-year honours, four-year major, and four-year minor Bachelor of Arts degrees, in addition to the three-year BA program already being offered in this subject area. With the addition of these degree programs, students can pursue Rural and Community studies from an undergraduate to Master's level at the university.</p>
