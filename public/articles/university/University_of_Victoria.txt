<p>The <strong>University of Victoria</strong> (UVic) is the second oldest degree granting university in British Columbia. This medium-sized university is located in <a>Greater Victoria, British Columbia</a>, <a>Canada</a> (northeast of <a>Victoria</a>) with an enrollment figure of more than 19,000 students. The campus is known for its beautiful gardens and mild climate. It attracts many students in part because of its size, its picturesque location, and its <a>cooperative education</a> program, which is the third largest in Canada. The university is the nation's lead institution in the <a>VENUS</a> and <a>NEPTUNE</a> projects.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>University of Victoria was established on 1 July 1963 in <a>Victoria, British Columbia</a> when an existing college of the <a>University of British Columbia</a> gained autonomy as a university. The non-denominational university had enjoyed 60 years of prior teaching tradition at the university level as <strong><a>Victoria College</a></strong>. This 60 years of history may be viewed conveniently in three distinct stages. Between the years 1903 and 1915, Victoria College was affiliated with <a>McGill University</a>, offering first- and second-year McGill courses in Arts and Science. Administered locally by the Victoria School Board, the College was an adjunct to <a>Victoria High School</a> and shared its facilities. Both institutions were under the direction of a single Principal: E.B. Paul, 1903&#x2013;1908; and S.J. Willis, 1908-1915.</p>
<p>The opening in 1915 of the University of British Columbia, established by Act of Legislature in 1908, obliged the College to suspend operations in higher education in Victoria. University of British Columbia was created in 1908. A single, public provincial university, it was modeled on the American state university, with an emphasis on extension work and applied research. The governance was modeled on the provincial University of Toronto Act of 1906 which established a bicameral system of university government consisting of a senate (faculty), responsible for academic policy, and a board of governors (citizens) exercising exclusive control over financial policy and having formal authority in all other matters. The president, appointed by the board, was to provide a link between the two bodies and to perform institutional leadership. The historical traditions of the university are reflected in the coat of arms, its academic regalia and its house flag. The BA hood is of solid red, a colour that recalls the early affiliation with McGill. The BSc hood, of gold, and the BEd hood, of blue, show the colours of the University of British Columbia. Blue and gold have been retained as the official colours of the University of Victoria. The motto at the top of the Arms of the University, in Hebrew characters, is &quot;Let there be Light&quot;; the motto at the bottom, in Latin, is &quot;A Multitude of the Wise is the Health of the World.&quot;</code></p>

<p><a>thumb|right|250px|Medical Sciences Building at UVic</a> The main Campus is located in the <a>Gordon Head</a> area of Greater Victoria.  With a total area of 403 acres (1.6&nbsp;km&#x00b2;), the campus spans the border between the municipalities of <a>Oak Bay</a> and <a>Saanich</a>.  The original campus plan was prepared by the <a>San Francisco</a> architecture and planning firm of <a>Wurster, Bernardi &amp; Emmons</a>.  The general concept of the original design is still being followed with the academic portions of the campus located inside Ring Road which forms a perfect circle 600&nbsp;m (1969&nbsp;ft) in diameter.  Outside of Ring Road are the parking lots, Student Union Building, residence buildings, the sports facilities as well as some of the academic facilities that are more self contained (Law and Theatre for example).

One of the buildings is named for General <a>Sir Arthur William Currie</a>.</p>
<p>Much of the university property has been dedicated to nature, notably <a>Finnerty Gardens</a> and <a>Mystic Vale</a>, a 44,000m&#x00b2; (11&nbsp;acre) forested ravine. The campus is home to deer, owls, squirrels, the occasional cougar and many other wild animals native to the area. The large population of domestic <a>rabbit</a>s, which likely descended from abandoned house pets from the surrounding community, is a memorable feature of the campus. As of May 2010, the University has begun trapping and <a>euthanizing</a> the bunnies  as they have been known to put athletes at risk in the playing fields. It has been documented that local veterinarians have offered to perform neutering of the male bunnies. However the university believes that it needs to act quickly on the matter and will consider sterilizing the remaining bunnies later.</p>
