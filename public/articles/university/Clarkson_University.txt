<p> <strong>Clarkson University</strong> is a private university located in <a>rural</a> <a>Potsdam</a>, <a>New York</a>. It was founded in 1896 and has an enrollment of about 3,000 students studying towards <a>bachelor</a>'s, <a>master</a>'s, and <a>doctoral</a> <a>degrees</a> in each of its three schools: the School of <a>Business</a>, School of <a>Arts</a> &amp; <a>Science</a>s, and the <a>Wallace H. Coulter</a> School of <a>Engineering</a>.</p>
<h2>Programs</h2>
<p>Clarkson University is home to the Center for Advanced Materials Processing (CAMP).  CAMP at Clarkson University is dedicated to developing Clarkson's research and educational programs in high-technology materials processing. CAMP's mandate is to develop innovations in advanced materials processing and to transfer this technology to business and industry.  The center receives support from the New York State Office of Science, Technology, and Academic Research for research and operating expenses as one of 14 Centers for Advanced Technology (CATs). In addition, CAMP-related work receives several million dollars each year from the federal government and private industry.</p>
<p>Clarkson's 16 Student Projects for Engineering Experience and Design (SPEED) teams allow students across all majors to participate in hands on, extracurricular projects.</p>
<p>Clarkson participates in <a>student exchange program</a>s with many schools in <a>Europe</a> and <a>Australia</a>. One example is the <a>University of Leicester</a> in the <a>UK</a> where students who are studying engineering come to Clarkson for a year as part of one of the exchange programs.</p>
<p><em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a>'s</em> [<a>http://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/college/directory/brief/drglance_2699_brief.php</a>] 2010 annual America's Best Colleges placed Clarkson University in tier one, the top tier of national universities, with a ranking of 119.</p>
<p>In 2007, Princeton Review and Entrepreneur magazine ranked Clarkson University's undergraduate business program in innovation and entrepreneurship #22 among 700 U.S. higher educational institutions.</p>
<p><em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a>'s</em> Best Graduate Schools 2009 ranks Clarkson 26th overall in <a>Environmental Engineering</a> and 62nd in <a>Civil Engineering</a>.</p>
<p>The 2007 <a>Faculty Scholarly Productivity Index</a> ranks Clarkson seventh in the nation among small research universities.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The school was founded in 1896, funded by the sisters of Thomas S. Clarkson, a local entrepreneur who was accidentally killed while working in his <a>sandstone</a> <a>quarry</a> not far from Potsdam.  When a worker was in danger of being crushed by a loose pump, Clarkson pushed him out of the way risking his own life.  Clarkson was crushed against a wall by the swinging pump, sunstaining severe internal injuries.  He died five days later. The Clarkson family realized great wealth in the development of such quarries, and Potsdam sandstone was highly sought after by developers of <a>townhouses</a> in <a>New York City</a> and elsewhere. The family were important benefactors in the Potsdam area.  The school was called the <em>Thomas S. Clarkson Memorial School of Technology</em>.<a>thumb|300px|Old Main, 2009</a> <a>thumb|300px|Old Snell Hall, 2009</a></p>
<p>In 1913 the name was changed to <em>Thomas S. Clarkson Memorial College of Technology</em>, which was used in a shortened version as <em>Clarkson College of Technology</em> or <em>CCT</em>. During the first half of the 20th century the majority of the campus was located &quot;downtown&quot;.  The campus slowly expanded to an area known as the &quot;Hill&quot;, located on the south-western edge of the village.  As of 2001, almost all academics and housing had moved to the hill campus, although the university still uses the downtown buildings known as Old Snell, and Old Main for administrative functions.</p>
<p>On 24 February 1984 the school officially became <em>Clarkson University</em>, although the pep band's rallying cry at hockey games is still &quot;Let's Go Tech!&quot;.  The school and its hockey team have carried the nickname &quot;Tech&quot; since the 1896 founding.  &quot;CCT&quot; is still printed on older school property and equipment.</p>
<p>Much to the dismay of many alumni, the <a>State University of New York at Canton</a> (SUNY Canton) in neighboring <a>Canton</a> has informally adopted the moniker Canton College of Technology.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>The Clarkson School</h2>
<p><a>The Clarkson School</a>, a special division of Clarkson University, was founded in 1978 as a unique educational opportunity. The School offers students an early entrance opportunity into college, replacing the typical senior year of high school with a year of college. It is one of few college early admission programs in the country that provides a real community living/learning experience on a university campus.</p>
<p>The Clarkson School's Bridging Year is a &quot;<a>bridging year</a>&quot; between high school and college for students who are ready to enter college early. Every year 50 to 80 11th grade students are accepted to The Clarkson School, where they work towards a <a>GED</a> and take college classes. They may also work with their high schools to complete a high school diploma. After they complete the program, they are given the option to enter Clarkson University with all credits from the previous year.</p>
<p>Students in The Clarkson School are fully matriculated undergraduates with freshman status at the University. They take classes with other University students and usually carry a course load of 15 to 18 credits per semester for two semesters. College credits may also be given for college and Advanced Placement courses taken before entering The Clarkson School. Cross-registration at neighboring area colleges and universities can provide additional college credits, particularly in art, music and languages. These credits also appear on an official Clarkson University transcript.</p>
<p>The Clarkson School students are housed in <a>Farrisee</a> House in Price Hall and the typical class size is about 50 students. Students participating in this program are called &quot;Schoolies&quot; by other Clarkson students.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>Clarkson has two distinct campuses, the &quot;downtown&quot; campus and the &quot;hill&quot; campus. During the last 20 years Clarkson has developed almost exclusively on the hill campus. The Department of Physical Therapy is located in the downtown campus. The campus bookstore is located in the downtown Potsdam.  The last student <a>dormitory</a> (Congdon) located on the downtown campus closed in May 2006. The only buildings remaining in Clarkson's service at the downtown campus are a few administration buildings, the Army and Air Force ROTC houses, as well as the Pre-PT (Physical Therapy) program. Most other downtown campus buildings have been leased or sold.</p>
<p><em><a>PC Magazine</a></em> and <a>The Princeton Review</a> ranked Clarkson among the top-20 wired colleges in the nation for 2007. &quot;The Top Wired Colleges&quot; honors colleges with the most comprehensive&#x2014;in terms of size, scope and quality&#x2014;computing and technology offerings.</p>
<p>The 2007 Princeton Review considers Clarkson to be one of &quot;Best Northeastern Colleges&quot;.</p>

The band consists of approximately 75 full-time members, and performs at Clarkson's Cheel Arena at all of the home games for the Men's NCAA Division 1 hockey team and some games for the NCAA Division 1 Women's team.</p>
<p>The band also travels to Clarkson Men's ECAC Hockey conference away games with 35-40 members (unless restricted by the policies of the opposing team's arena) and post-season tournaments.</p>
<p>The Clarkson University Pep Band was founded in the fall of 1964, by a small group of Clarkson students. By the 1980s, the band's membership grew significantly.</p>
<p>The current conductor of the Pep Band is Bobby Loverro.</p>
<h4>Clarkson Theatre Company</h4>
<p>The Clarkson Theatre Company (CTC) is a student-run theatre group, part of Clarkson University and supported by the Clarkson University Student Association (CUSA). The mission of CTC is to provide both theatrical entertainment and an outlet for artistic self-expression in the realm of the theatre arts at Clarkson.  Membership consists of students and faculty from Clarkson and the other Associated Colleges of the St. Lawrence Valley (<a>SUNY Potsdam</a>, <a>SUNY Canton</a>, and <a>St. Lawrence University</a>)</p>
<p>Every fall, CTC puts on a musical over Clarkson University's family weekend, sometime in mid-to-late October. The production time for this show is between 5 and 7 weeks. After the fall production is over, preparations for the One Act Festival begin. This festival is made up of short plays chosen and directed by students, as well as several written by students as well. This festival is usually put on as a fundraiser for a charity chosen by the executive board, and takes place at the end of January or beginning of February. The next show, usually a straight play, is put on near the beginning of April. Show choice for each slot is not limited to either a musical or play, but it is traditional to use this structure; as shows are chosen by a general member vote, however, any show can be chosen to be put on any semester.</p>
<p>CTC's most famous alum is not a student, but an adviser.  <a>Wes Craven</a>, creator of the <a>A Nightmare on Elm Street</a> franchise, was a professor at Clarkson University in 1968, as well as faculty adviser to the Clarkson Drama Club (the predecessor of the current Clarkson Theatre Company). As part of one of Professor Craven's classes, Humanities IV, several <a>Theta Chi</a> members wanted to make a spoof of traditional horror movies, about the strange occurrences in their fraternity's house at 18 Elm Street. The filming included CTC's home, Old Snell Hall, where the boiler room scene took place in the basement. While none of those involved had very much film experience, they made the film for about $300 and it was shown twice on campus. Much of Craven's inspiration for <em><a>A Nightmare on Elm Street</a></em> came from this first filmmaking experience; the house in the movie, while not the house used in the first version, resembles this house and also resides on Elm Street. The town in <em>A Nightmare on Elm Street</em> is named Madstop, which is Potsdam backwards.</p>
<h3>Fraternities and Sororities</h3>
<p>Over the years there have been many different fraternities and sororities at Clarkson University. The following is a list of current organizations. In order for Clarkson to recognize a Greek organization all the members must be Clarkson students. Additionally, any organization applying for recognition after 1977 must affiliate with an International organization within five years to maintain recognition. A <a>time line</a> of Clarkson Greek organizations can be found on the Clarkson University website.</p>
