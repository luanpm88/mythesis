<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>left|thumb|The Main Building, dedicated in 1891.</a> <a>right|thumb|A machine testing laboratory at Drexel University, circa 1904.</a>  Drexel University was founded in 1891 as the Drexel Institute of Art, Science and Industry by Philadelphia financier and philanthropist <a>Anthony J. Drexel</a> to provide educational opportunities in the &#x201c;practical arts and sciences&#x201d; for women and men of all backgrounds. Drexel became the Drexel Institute of Technology in 1936, and in 1970 Drexel Institute of Technology gained university status, becoming Drexel University. On July 1, 2002, Drexel was officially united with the former MCP Hahnemann University, creating the Drexel University College of Medicine; and in the fall of 2006, Drexel established its School of Law. In June 2009, the president of Drexel University, <a>Constantine Papadakis</a>, died of lung cancer. In August 2010 <a>John Anderson Fry</a> was chosen in a unanimous vote to fill the vacancy.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.drexel.edu/fry/</a>&lt;/ref&gt; <img></p>

<h2>Campuses</h2>
<p> Drexel University's campus is divided into three parts: the <a>University City Campus</a>, the Center City Hahnemann Campus, which is comprised mainly of <a>Hahnemann University Hospital</a>, and the <a>Queen Lane College of Medicine Campus</a>.  The latter two are recent acquisitions by the university.</p>
<h3>University City Main Campus</h3>
<p><a>thumb|The southern portion of Drexel's campus</a> The  University City Main Campus of Drexel University is located just west of the <a>Schuylkill River</a> in the University City district of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It is Drexel's largest and oldest campus and it is the center of its administrative offices, as well as the main academic center for students.  It is located in the Powelton Village section of West Philadelphia.  The two prominent performing stages at Drexel University are the Mandell Theater and the Main Auditorium.  The Main Auditorium dates back to the founding of Drexel and construction of its main hall.  It features over 1000 seats, and a 1928 <a>pipe organ</a>.  The pipe organ was purchased by <a>Saturday Evening Post</a> publisher <a>Cyrus H. K. Curtis</a> after he had donated a similar organ , the <a>Curtis Organ</a>, to nearby <a>University of Pennsylvania</a> and it was suggested that he do the same for Drexel.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Drexel Legends and Traditions</a>&lt;/ref&gt;  The 424-seat Mandell Theater was built in 1973 and features a more performance-oriented stage, including a full <a>fly system</a>, modern stage lighting facilities, stadium seating, and accommodations for wheelchairs.  It is used for the semiannual spring musical, as well as various plays and many events.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Mandell Theater at Drexel University</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>Queen Lane Medical Campus</h3>
<p>The Queen Lane Medical Campus was purchased in 2003 by Drexel University from MCP Hahnemann University.  It is located in East Falls, which is in the Northwest part of Philadelphia and is primarily inhabited by first- and second-year medical students.  A free shuttle is available connecting it to the Center City Hahneman and University City Main campuses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Queen Lane&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>Center City Hahnemann Campus</h3>
<p> The Center City Hahnemann Campus is in the middle of Philadelphia, straddling the Vine Street Expressway and centered on <a>Hahnemann University Hospital</a>.  It is a part of the university's recent expansion into the medical field.</p>
<h3>Sacramento Center for Graduate Studies</h3>
<p>On October 29, 2007, a 40-person delegation from Drexel University completed a four-day visit to <a>Placer County, California</a> in preparation for a study on bringing a 6,000-student college campus to <a>Roseville</a>, a suburb in the <a>Sacramento metropolitan area</a>. Drexel is interested in opening a four-year private university west of Roseville on a  site that would be donated by the family of Sacramento developer <a>Angelo Tsakopoulos</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;Placer Campus Bee&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The area would be part of an overall  donation by the Tsakopoulos family, William and Claudia Cummings, Wayne and Mary Prim and their partners. A housing development would be established on the other . Residential units totaling 2,300 are being considered. The money raised through sale of the area to a developer or developers would be given to Drexel as an endowment for construction of the campus.</p>
<p>On January 5, 2009, Drexel University opened the Center for Graduate Studies in Sacramento.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; , the Sacramento Center offers a Ed.D. program in Educational Leadership and Management, and master degree programs in:  Business Administration, Higher Education, Human Resource Development, Information Systems, Public Health, Interdepartmental Medical Science, and Library and Information Science&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Drexel awards students at its Sacremento Center fellowships from a $10 million annual budget allocation.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Drexel is not the first university courted for the site. The Catholic order <a>Christian Brothers</a> withdrew its proposal in 2005 for a four-year private college called De La Salle because it was concerned that slow county approval of the project would increase development costs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Placer Campus Biz&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<h3>Activities</h3>
<p>The university has a large variety of <a>student organizations</a>, including <a>charity</a>, <a>fraternities and sororities</a>, <a>political</a>, and <a>academic groups</a>.</p>
<h4>Student Government</h4>
<p>The Undergraduate Student Government Association of Drexel University works with administrators to solve student problems and tries to promote communication between the students and the administration.</p>

<h3>Press and radio</h3>
<h4>Radio</h4>
<p> WKDU is Drexel's student-run FM radio station, with membership open to all undergraduate students. Its status as an 800-<a>watt</a> non-commercial station in a major market city has given it a wider audience and a higher profile than many other <a>college radio</a> stations.</p>
<h4>Television</h4>
<p>DUTV is Drexel's Philadelphia cable television station. The student operated station is part of the Paul F. Harron Studios at Drexel University. The purpose of DUTV is to provide &quot;the people of Philadelphia with quality educational television, and providing Drexel students the opportunity to gain experience in television management and production.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DUTV&quot;&gt;<a>DUTV</a>&lt;/ref&gt; The Programing includes an eclectic variety of shows from a bi-monthly news show, DNews, to old films, talk shows dealing with important current issues and music appreciation shows.&lt;ref name=&quot;DUTV&quot; /&gt;</p>
<h4>Publications</h4>
<p>Drexel has a number of publications to its name by both the student body and the university. <em><a>The Triangle</a></em> has been the university's newspaper since 1926. The yearbook was first published in 1911 and named the Lexerd in 1913.&lt;ref name=&quot;Timeline&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the publishing of a campus wide yearbook in 1911 <em>The Hanseatic</em> and <em>The Eccentric</em> were both published in 1896 as class books.&lt;ref name=&quot;DUArch&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Other publications include <em>MAYA</em>, the undergraduate student literary and artistic magazine; <em>D&amp;M Magazine</em>, Design &amp; Merchandising students crafted magazine; <em>The Smart Set from Drexel University</em>, an online magazine founded in 2005; and <em>The Drexelist</em> a blog-style news source founded in 2010.</p>
<p>The Drexel Publishing Group serves as a medium for literary publishing on campus. The Drexel Publishing Group oversees <em>ASK</em> (The Journal of the College of Arts and Sciences at Drexel University), <em>Painted Bride Quarterly</em>, a 36-year-old national literary magazine housed at Drexel; <em>The 33rd</em>, an annual anthology of student and faculty writing at Drexel; <em>DPG Online Magazine</em>, and <em>Maya</em>, the undergraduate literary and artistic magazine. The Drexel Publishing Group also serves as a pedagogical organization by allowing students to intern and work on its publications.</p>

<p> <a>left|thumb|Mario the Magnificent, mascot of Drexel</a> [[Image:DrexelDragons.png|thumb|right|[[Drexel Dragons]] logo]] Drexel's school mascot is a <a>dragon</a> known as &quot;Mario the Magnificent,&quot; named so in honor of Mario V. Mascioli, an alumnus and former member of the Board of Trustees.&lt;ref name=&quot;dragon&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Dragon has been the mascot of the school since around the mid 1920's; the first written reference to the Dragons occurred in 1928 when the football team was called The Dragons in <a>The Triangle</a>. Before becoming known as the Dragons the athletic teams had been known by such names as Blue &amp; Gold, the Engineers, and the Drexelites.&lt;ref name=&quot;dragon&quot; /&gt; The school's sports teams, now known as the <a>Drexel Dragons</a>, participate in the <a>NCAA</a>'s Division I, the <a>Colonial Athletic Association</a>, and the <a>Middle Atlantic Intercollegiate Sailing Association</a>. They do not currently field a varsity football team.</p>
<p>Drexel is home to 33 active club teams including squash, triathlon, and cycling.  Other club teams include soccer, baseball, rugby, field hockey, and roller hockey.  The club teams operate under the direction of the Club Sports Council and the Recreational Sports Office.</p>
<h4>Fight song</h4>
<p>The fight song for Drexel is  the <em>Drexel Fight Song</em>.  The lyrics are:</p>
<p>Fight on for Drexel,&lt;br&gt; We&#x2019;ve got the stuff we need to win this game.&lt;br&gt; We&#x2019;re gonna fight on for Drexel,&lt;br&gt; Take the Dragon on to fame.&lt;br&gt; Fight on for Drexel,&lt;br&gt; The gold and blue is on another spree.&lt;br&gt; We&#x2019;re gonna fight, fight, fight, fight for Drexel U.&lt;br&gt; On to victory!&lt;br&gt; :Chant: D-D-D-D&lt;br&gt; R-R-R-R&lt;br&gt; E-E-E-E&lt;br&gt; X-EL-X-EL&lt;br&gt; DREX-EL-DREX-EL&lt;br&gt; FIGHT-TEAM-FIGHT&lt;br&gt; (Repeat Song)&lt;ref&gt;Old Yells and March songs may be found at <a>http://www.library.drexel.edu/archives/pdf/DrexelYellsandSongs.1931-1.pdf</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h2>Student lore and traditions</h2>
<p>To receive good grades on exams, a tradition is to rub the toe of the <a>bronze</a> &quot;Waterboy&quot; <a>statue</a> located in the Main Building atrium. Although the rest of the bronze statue has developed a dark brown <a>patina</a> over the years, the toe has remained highly polished and shines like new.&lt;ref name=&quot;dragon&quot; /&gt;</p>
<p>The Flame of Knowledge, a fountain once located in the main quad (now relocated to the area in front of North Hall), used to be known as the &quot;Drexel Shaft&quot; in the late 70s and early 80s,&lt;ref&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; however the name outgrew the landmark.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;Drexel Shaft&quot; now refers to the Penn Coach Yard chimney, the large smoke stack structure which was located east of 32nd street. Unresponsive treatment by the administration has been termed the &quot;Drexel Shaft&quot; by students.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The smoke stack was demolished on November 15, 2009, a long-anticipated event which the students hope will improve the overall aesthetics of the university.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
