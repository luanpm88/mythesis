<p>The <strong>University of Prince Edward Island</strong> (<strong>UPEI</strong>) is a <a>public</a> <a>liberal arts</a> university in <a>Charlottetown</a>, <a>Prince Edward Island</a>, <a>Canada</a>, and the sole university in the province. Founded in 1969, it traces its roots back to its two earlier predecessor organizations, <a>St. Dunstan's University</a> and <a>Prince of Wales College</a>, founded in 1855 and 1860.&lt;ref name=&quot;thecanadianencyclopedia.com&quot;&gt;<a>http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm</a>? PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=U1ARTU0003534&lt;/ref&gt; The two institutions were merged in 1969 by the government of <a>Alex Campbell</a> as part of a campaign to integrate the Island's <a>Roman Catholic</a> and <a>Protestant</a> communities, which had previously maintained the two separate institutions of higher learning.  <a>Holland College</a> was later created to fill the void left by the merger of Prince of Wales College into the university.  The enabling legislation is the <em>University Act, R.S.P.E.I 2000.</em> &lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.gov.pe.ca/law/statutes/pdf/u-04.pdf</a> <em>University Act, R.S.P.E.I 2000</em>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The University of Prince Edward Island is a non-denominational university established in 1969 by the amalgamation of <a>Prince of Wales College</a> (PWC) founded in 1834, and <a>St. Dunstan's University</a> (SDU) founded in 1855.&lt;ref name=&quot;thecanadianencyclopedia.com&quot;/&gt; Its predecessor institutions ceased to operate although St. Dunstan's still retains its charter and the lands that were home to Prince of Wales became the campus for Holland College. UPEI is located on the former St. Dunstan's campus.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>UPEI's campus, located at the corner of Belvedere and University Avenues in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island's capital city, is built on 134 acres (54 hectares) of land. The Confederation Trail runs alongside its eastern edge.</p>
<p>Original SDU buildings in the central quadrangle have been renovated to retain integrity of their exterior aesthetic design while meeting modern standards. Main Building, built in 1854, and Dalton Hall, built between 1917 and 1919, are on the <a>registry of Historic Places of Canada</a>.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.historicplaces.ca/visit-visite/affichage-display.aspx?id=5897</a> Main Building Registry of Historic Places of Canada&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.historicplaces.ca/visit-visite/affichage-display.aspx?id=5898</a> Dalton Hall Registry of Historic Places of Canada&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The War Memorial Hall (more generally known as Memorial Hall) is a landmark building on the campus of UPEI. Built as a men&#x2019;s residence building in 1946, Memorial Hall honours alumni who had enlisted and died in the <a>First World War</a>, and in the <a>Second World War</a>. &lt;ref&gt; <a>http://www.upei.ca/facilities/campus/memorial-hall</a> War Memorial Hall&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Over the past three decades, UPEI has experienced significant growth with many new buildings integrated into the campus, including Central Utility Building (1973), Duffy Science Centre, Blanchard Hall (1973), Bernardine Hall, Robertson Library (1975), <a>Atlantic Veterinary College</a> (1986), Chi-Wan Young Sports Centre (1990), Wanda Wyatt Dining Hall (1990), Food Technology Centre, K.C. Irving Chemistry Centre (1997), W.A. Murphy Student Centre (2002), MacLauchlan Arena (2004), Bill and Denise Andrew Hall residence facility (2006), expansions to the Atlantic Veterinary College (2007 and 2009), Regis and Joan Duffy Research Centre (2007), a research and development laboratory which is home to the <a>National Research Council of Canada</a>, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, and other partners, and Don and Marion McDougall Hall (2008).</p>
<p>In October 2004, the UPEI administration undertook an official campus plan to improve the <a>aesthetics</a> of modern buildings constructed since the amalgamation which do not enhance the original SDU design, and to take overall campus aesthetics into account for future developments on and adjacent to the campus.</p>

<h2>University Island</h2>
<p> In 2009, the University of Prince Edward Island developed the concept of <a>&#x201c;University Island&#x201d;</a> to describe the ways in which UPEI makes a difference &#x201c;on the Island and around the world.&#x201d; &lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.universityisland.ca</a>&lt;/ref&gt; A website, <a>universityisland.ca</a>, was created to showcase the University&#x2019;s outreach in the areas of learning, community service, and research. Using google-mapping technology, the database includes hundreds of examples of how UPEI is making an impact, providing opportunity and leadership, and generating successful outcomes, at home and around the world.</p>
<p>Examples include:</p>
<p>Learning: UPEI is committed to students and professors learning from each other &#x2014; inside the classroom and out, on the Island and beyond. With opportunities such as <a>co-operative education</a> and <a>internships</a>, <a>teaching practicums</a> and <a>nursing placements</a>, <a>international exchange agreements</a>, faculty exchanges, and students doing real-world research alongside their professors &#x2014; on campus and off &#x2014; students are applying what they learn in the classroom to the world around them.</p>
<p>Community Service: UPEI prides itself on being an integral part of the Island community. The campus is well-known to Islanders of all ages, from children who take part in <a>Panther day camps</a> or come to <a>varsity games</a>, to adults who use the <a>Robertson Library</a> or take classes through <a>Seniors College</a>. The Atlantic Veterinary College&#x2019;s Veterinary Teaching Hospital and Centres of Expertise have an international reputation for service. Students, faculty, and staff blanket Prince Edward Island through their community outreach and volunteer activities.</p>
<p>Research: UPEI&#x2019;s size and sense of place are assets when it comes to research and scholarship. Small size allows the University to be an incubator for new ideas, and the people needed to bring these leading-edge ideas to fruition are just next-door or down the street. Research at home, and in Asia, Africa, the Americas, and elsewhere, addresses important issues of community, health, and environment. Professors work hand in hand with students, industry, governments, and NGOs &#x2014; doing work that matters in the real world.</p>
