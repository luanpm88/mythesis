<p><strong>Laurentian University</strong> (<em>Universit&#x00e9; Laurentienne</em>), founded in 1960, is a mid-sized <a>bilingual</a> <a>university</a> in <a>Greater Sudbury</a>, <a>Ontario</a>, <a>Canada</a>. While LU's focus is primarily on undergraduate programming, the university also features Canada's newest medical school &#x2014; opened in 2005, the <a>Northern Ontario School of Medicine</a>, in consortium with <a>Lakehead University</a>. Its school of Graduate Studies offers a growing number of graduate-level degrees. Laurentian is the largest bilingual provider of <a>distance education</a> in Canada.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The university's campus is located on the south side of <a>Lake Ramsey</a>, just south of Greater Sudbury's downtown core and near some of the city's wealthiest residential neighbourhoods. The city's Idylwylde <a>golf course</a> also borders on the university campus.</p>
<p>The university has a <a>federated school</a> structure, similar to that of the <a>University of Toronto</a>. The school also has an unusual and sometimes controversial student government structure &mdash; there are actually two separate <a>student unions</a> (in addition to the part time and graduate student associations). The Francophone Student's Association (AEF) is for <a>francophones</a>, while the Student's General Association (SGA) is for both <a>anglophones</a> and francophones. However, any student can affiliate with either union, regardless of language, and because the two unions do not offer identical student services, many students from one language group change their affiliation to the other student union depending on which services they want. Consequently, in practice the two student unions often compete with each other rather than serving distinct groups.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Laurentian's historical roots lie in the <a>Roman Catholic</a> church.</p>
<p>A university federation combining representatives from the Roman Catholic, United, and Anglican churches was formed in the 1959-60 academic year.</p>
<h2>Administration</h2>
<p>Upon the resignation of the last president, Dr. Judith Woodsworth, Dominic Giroux became the president of Laurentian University. Dr. Woodsworth had been president of Laurentian University since July 2002. In April 2006, she had been reappointed by the Board of Governors for a second five-year term which commenced in July 2007. She left the university as the new President and Vice-Chancellor of Concordia University, Montreal. Under her leadership, Laurentian saw the opening of the Northern Ontario School of Medicine in 2005, the creation of the university&#x2019;s first six PhD programs, tremendous growth in research capacity and numerous construction projects on campus. The Board of Governors heads the university with the president. Directly to the left and right of the president is the assistant to the president, and the Laurentian University senate.</p>
<p><a>Aline Chr&#x00e9;tien</a>, the wife of former Canadian Prime Minister <a>Jean Chr&#x00e9;tien</a>, was named the university's chancellor on September 22, 2010.</p>
<p>Laurentian University's affiliate universities, each have a chancellor. The chancellor is largely a ceremonial role, and has little participation in the day-to-day operations of the university. The chancellor for the affiliated, University of Sudbury is prominent Sudbury lawyer Andr&#x00e9; Lacroix Q.C./c.r. LL.D. (from the law firm Lacroix Forest LLP/s.r.l.). The chancellor for the affiliated Thorneloe University is Dr. Ernie Checkeris. And the first chancellor of the affiliated Huntington University is Dr. Edward (Ted) Conroy, another prominent Sudbury lawyer from the law firm of Conroy Scott Trebb Hurtubise LLP. University administration is the responsibility of the Board of Governors, headed by the chairperson of the Board of Governors. This post is current held by <a>Floyd Laughren</a>.</p>

<h3>Commerce and Administration</h3>
<p>Laurentian's school of commerce and administration was founded in 1960. Laurentian has embraced the world of international business by creating and maintaining relationships with other universities around the world. It is modeled on the prestigious <a>University of Western Ontario</a>'s <a>Richard Ivey School of Business</a>. The school offers small class sizes, one-on-one teaching, and an outstanding faculty. The school of commerce and administration offers a wide variety of programs, from <a>MBAs</a> to honours degrees in Commerce, Sports Administration (SPAD) and e-Business.</p>
<p>The school utilizes the case study method, in which it teaches through extensive use of business case studies. The case method enables class discussion of real business problems; which will apply the concepts, decision making methods and tools to those situations to help develop analytical and decision making skills. Students get involved in the community by studying real organizations of their choice, participating in research projects sponsored by businesses in the community and solving real problems.</p>
<h3>Education</h3>
<p>Currently, Laurentian has both English and French language education programs for teacher training.</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>L<code>&#x00c9;cole des sciences</code></em></li>
</ul>
<p>In the Alphonse Raymond building, at the east end of campus, is <strong>L<code>&#x00c9;cole des sciences de l</code>&#x00e9;ducation de l<code>Universit&#x00e9; Laurentienne</code></strong>. Named after Father Alphonse Raymond, and opened in 1974, the building houses classrooms, a cafeteria, an auditorium, a small gymnasium, and offices for more than a dozen professors. Students attending L'&#x00c9;cole des sciences have a variety of programs from which to choose. The school, for example, offers a traditional consecutive post-grad B.Ed., a newer concurrent B.A. Educ. degree that can be taken full or part-time, the possibility of engaging in studies on-line, and the chance for certified teachers to complete additional qualifications. B.Ed. students who attend L'&#x00c9;cole des sciences must complete fifty days of practicum placement focusing on observation and practice teaching. The program provides many of the French-speaking teachers who work in Ontario's publicly-funded education system, particularly in schools located in the northeastern section of the province. See <a>http://laurentienne.ca/educ/index.htm</a></p>
<ul>
  <li><em>English-language School</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The English side of the education equation has been more chequered. In 1967 Nipissing University College (with its origins in the North Bay Normal School - commonly called a &quot;Teachers&#x2019; College&quot; in Ontario) became affilitated with Laurentian. But in 1992 Nipissing received its own charter and Laurentian lost its formal connection to an English language school of education. More than a decade later, in September 2003, Laurentian began offering its own bachelor of education program in English. This concurrent B.Ed. is a four or five year program taken along with an undergraduate degree. The primary goal of the English language bachelor of education program is to foster the development of a new generation of reflective educators who employ holistic teaching approaches. The curriculum features an emphasis on equity and diversity as well as the infusion of <a>aboriginal</a> issues and content. At the moment, the program is offered in just two of the three areas of potential concentration: the primary/junior and junior/intermediate divisions. A new school of education building - based on sustainable environmental principles and located across from L<code>&#x00c9;cole des sciences at the east end of the campus - was completed in the summer of 2008. See <a>http://laurentian.ca/education/</a>.  The program requires a 75% average over your first four years (weighted 12.5/12.5/37.5/37.5) in order to progress to the final (or pro year).</code></p>
<p>Although the guaranteed entry into the pro year (average pending) is a plus for many students, there has been a level of dissatisfaction among some students regarding their treatment by certain staff at the School of Education.</p>

<h2>Student life</h2>
<h3>Student General Association</h3>
<p>The SGA is the largest student union at Laurentian, with around 5100 students. It offers services in both English and French, although in recent years the English services have become predominant. The association is presided over by a board of directors consisting of representatives of each of the academic departments and residences, as well as commissioners representing groups within the school (<a>francophone</a>, <a>aboriginal</a>, <a>lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender</a>, <a>international students</a>, <a>women</a>, cultural affairs and special needs), three university senators and the executive. Under the by-laws the board only comes into existence on the first day of classes of the fall session and is dissolved at the end of the winter session, for the remainder of year the executive has the full powers of the board.</p>
<p>The executive consists of the president and two vice-presidents (student issues and services), supplemented by an executive director and a receptionist. The staff of the association is relatively small &#x2014; the president, executive director and receptionist are all full time employees. The vice-president of services is a full time employee from May 1 until the first day of classes in the fall term, when he or she becomes part time. The vice-president of student issues is a part time employee from the second Monday in August onward. The Chief Returning Officer is a part time employee during the election campaign. The editor of <em><a>Lambda</a></em>, the director of <a>CKLU</a>, the manager of Pub Down Under and the manager of the games room are part-time employees of arm length operations.</p>
<h3>Media</h3>
<p>The university's <a>campus radio</a> station, <a>CKLU</a>, broadcasts at <a>FM</a> 96.7 in both <a>English</a> and <a>French</a>. Its campus newspapers are <em><a>Lambda</a></em> in English and <em><a>L'Orignal d&#x00e9;cha&#x00ee;n&#x00e9;</a></em> (&quot;The Unchained Moose&quot;) in French. <em>Lambda</em> is a member of <a>Canadian University Press</a>, and CKLU is a member of the <a>National Campus and Community Radio Association</a>.</p>
<h3>Sports</h3>
<p>The university's varsity teams, known as the <strong>Voyageurs</strong> for the men's teams and the <strong>Lady Vees</strong> for the women's teams, compete in <a>basketball</a>, <a>soccer</a>, <a>swimming</a>, <a>cross-country running</a>, <a>golf</a>, <a>curling</a>, and <a>Nordic skiing</a>. There are also competitive club teams in <a>lacrosse</a> and <a>rowing</a> and a plethora of intramural sports programmes. The Lady Vees basketball team have been one of the most successful franchises in the history of the <a>Canadian Interuniversity Sport women's basketball championship</a>, winning the title seven times. Notable alumnae of the basketball team include broadcaster <a>Sylvia Sweeney</a>. The current director of the athletic department is Peter Hellstrom.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<h3>Great Hall (Grand Salon)</h3>
<p>The Great Hall is a multipurpose dining hall and <a>auditorium</a> that plays a prominent role in the life of the University. During special events, invited speakers and dignitaries may address the University population or general public from the Great Hall. Many conferences held in Sudbury may book the hall for lectures or presentations. Even bands touring Canadian campuses may schedule concerts at the Great Hall.</p>
<p>On a more routine basis, the Great Hall serves as the dining area of the university <a>cafeteria</a>, and is a popular place for student, staff, and faculty alike to grab a snack at breakfast, lunch, or dinner. (The adjacent servery features a made-to-order sandwich bar, <a>Pizza Pizza</a> counter, stir-fry station, grill, and baked goods stand.)</p>
<p>The hall's outdoor balcony has a view of the greens of the Idywylde Golf and Country Club.</p>
<h3>Fraser Auditorium</h3>
<p>The Fraser Auditorium in the Fraser Building is another large-volume auditorium, though it is more formal than the Great Hall and is regularly used for the larger first-year classes. The Fraser Auditorium is also used for special events and conferences, but a student's most memorable visit will likely be for <a>convocation</a> ceremonies, held within the auditorium each spring. In addition the Fraser Auditorium has hosted the Falconbridge Lecture Series hosting such guests as Chief Justice <a>Beverley McLachlin</a>, and Senator <a>Rom&#x00e9;o Dallaire</a> (March 2006).</p>
<p>The auditorium also sometimes hosts cultural events, such as theatre and concert performances, and was the original home of the city's <a>Th&#x00e9;&#x00e2;tre du Nouvel-Ontario</a> and <a>Sudbury Theatre Centre</a>.</p>
<h3>Ben Avery</h3>
<p>The Ben Avery is the sports building. There are a number for Varsity teams from the popular basketball teams to the soccer teams on the field. The Ben Avery is the focal point of the non-academic action. The Ben Avery also has a weight and cardiovascular room. An <a>IAAF</a> 8 lane 400m mondo track (2010) compliments the sport fields with seating for 5000.</p>
<h2>Residences</h2>
<p>The Laurentian Residences offers four unique residences under the supervision of the main campus and three located at the main campus under the supervision of the federated colleges.</p>
<h3>Single Student Residence (SSR)</h3>
<p>The Single Student Residence is an apartment style complex consisting of 4-6 residents in personal apartment containing a living room, kitchen, and washrooms. The entire complex includes rooms for 387 students in 72 apartments. Student Street, consisting of a convenience store, computer room, mail room, snack bar, and games room, among other rooms and services, is located at the bottom of the SSR complex.</p>
<h3>University College Residence (UC)</h3>
<p>The University College Residence is a ten storey co-ed building with single and double (shared) rooms, providing accommodations for 240 students. University College is also connected to student street giving students access to the same amenitties available to SSR students.</p>
<h3>Married/Mature Student Residence (MSR)</h3>
<p>The Mature Student Residence offers furnished apartments for those whom have accumulated over 90 university credits. The residence is generally thought of as the overall quietest at Laurentian. The rooms consist of one bedroom, a living room, bathroom and kitchen.</p>
<h3>The West Residence</h3>
<p>This residence is the newest residence at Laurentian. It is designed for students who have spent at least two years at the university and obtained a minimum of at least 60 credits. The residence consists of same sex apartment style rooms and cost $14.5 million CAD.</p>
<h3>Thorneloe Residence</h3>
<p>The Thorneloe University College Residence provides accommodations for 58 students. This residence offers large kitchens, sauna, and common rooms with large pool tables. In 2004 the former administrative offices were transformed into a suite for four students. Thorneloe University College, although founded by the Anglican Diocese of Algoma, welcomes all students at Laurentian.</p>
<h3>University of Sudbury</h3>
<p>The University of Sudbury Lucien Matte Residence houses 174 students in 92 single and 41 double bedrooms. The University of Sudbury, although associated with the Roman Catholic Church, welcomes those of all religions.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Huntington University</h3>
<p> The Huntington University College Residence houses 184 students in dorm-style rooms. Kitchens and TV lounges are present on all four floors. The residence is located with the Academic complex which includes classrooms and a library. Huntington University is affiliated with the <a>United Church of Canada</a>, but does not require religious affiliation. Christopher Levan, noted author, was once president of Huntington University.</p>
