<p> <a>thumb|Dormitory at Florham campus</a> <strong>Fairleigh Dickinson University</strong> is an <a>American</a> university with several campuses located in <a>New Jersey</a>, <a>Canada</a>, and the <a>United Kingdom</a>.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The institution has two main campuses located in New Jersey: (1) the College at Florham in <a>Madison</a> and <a>Florham Park</a> which is centered on the former estate of Florence Vanderbilt and Hamilton Twombly, and (2) the Metropolitan Campus located close to New York City and spanning the <a>Hackensack River</a> in <a>Teaneck</a> and <a>Hackensack</a>. It also owns two international campuses, one in <a>Vancouver, British Columbia</a>, and another in <a>Wroxton</a>, England, known as <a>Wroxton College</a>. In 1965, Fairleigh Dickinson University acquired the <a>Wroxton Abbey</a>, now home to Wroxton College, from <a>Trinity College</a>, <a>Oxford University</a> becoming the first American university to own and operate its own campus in England, and the first to own and operate a campus outside the United States. In 2007, the university began offering degree programs at a new campus in the downtown neighborhood of Yaletown in <a>Vancouver</a>, British Columbia named FDU-Vancouver.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Fairleigh Dickinson University was founded by Dr. Peter Sammartino and his wife, Sylvia, in 1942 in <a>Rutherford, New Jersey</a> as a two-year college. It was named for its benefactor, Colonel <a>Fairleigh S. Dickinson, Sr.</a> (1858&#x2013;1942), a co-founder of <a>Becton Dickinson</a>. By 1948, Fairleigh Dickinson College expanded its curriculum to offer a four-year program. In that same year, the school received accreditation from the <a>Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools</a>. In 1956, the same year the University acquired the former Twombly-Vanderbilt estate in Madison, the institution was recognized as Fairleigh Dickinson University by the New Jersey State Board of Education.</p>
<p>Landscape architect <a>Frederick Law Olmsted</a>, the designer of Central Park, was also commissioned to design the landscape for the Twombly-Vanderbilt estate (now the College at Florham campus). The main house of the Twombly-Vanderbilt estate, now Hennessy Hall, was designed by architectural firm <a>McKim, Mead, and White</a> in the <a>Georgian Revival</a> style. The mansion was completed in 1897 and was modeled after the wing of Hampton Court Palace designed by architect Christopher Wren.</p>
<p>In addition to the present campuses, Fairleigh Dickinson University operated campuses in Rutherford (where the University was founded) and in <a>Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands</a>.  Operations on the Rutherford Campus were merged with the Metropolitan Campus in 1993 and the Rutherford Campus was later sold to <a>Felician College</a>.  The St. Croix Marine Biology Lab was damaged beyond repair during <a>Hurricane Hugo</a> and was closed shortly afterwards.</p>
<p>In 2001, <a>Ron Howard</a>'s award winning movie <em><a>A Beautiful Mind</a></em> was partly filmed at Fairleigh Dickinson's College at Florham.</p>
<p>During the 2008-2009 academic year the College at Florham celebrated a year-long celebration to mark the 50th anniversary of that campus.</p>
<p>The alma mater of all the campuses is the following: </p>
<p>Praise to thee, O Alma Mater, faithfully we sing, Hear our joyful voices ringing, Fairleigh Dickinson. Campus halls, that oft recall us, memories will bring, Campus lights will ever guide us, when the day is done. Alma Mater, we will cherish each day of the years We were privileged to spend here, tho&#x2019; our parting nears.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>Both New Jersey campuses have a large variety of courses and programs. The College at Florham emphasizes traditional liberal arts and sciences.

Fairleigh Dickinson is home to the QUEST program, where students can study any major and combine their <a>bachelor's degree</a> with a <a>master's</a> in education.
