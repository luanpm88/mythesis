<p>   <strong>Dawson College</strong> () was the first English <a>CEGEP</a> and is located in <a>Westmount</a>, just west  of downtown <a>Montreal</a>, <a>Quebec</a>, <a>Canada</a>. Dawson College is located near the heart of downtown Montreal in a former nunnery on 4.85 hectares of green space. It is the largest CEGEP in Quebec, with a student population of about 10,000 day students and 3,000 night students enrolled in more than 50 fields of study.</p>
<h2>Programs</h2>
<p><a>left|thumb|200px|Dawson College</a> The CEGEP offers two types of programs: pre-university and technical. The pre-university programs, which take two years to complete, cover the subject matters which roughly correspond to the additional year of high school given elsewhere in Canada in preparation for a chosen field in university. The technical programs, which take three years to complete, apply to students who wish to pursue a skilled trade. Evening courses are offered through Continuing Education in both credit and non credit division and corporate training is available as well.  Dawson recently partnered with the University of Sherbrooke to launch the Confucius Institute in Quebec on its campus.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>right|thumb|200px|Dawson College on Sherbrooke</a> Originally, a Dawson College existed at the Royal Canadian Air Force Base, St. Jean (now <a>Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu</a>), Quebec, in the <a>Eastern Townships</a> (later the location of <a>Le Coll&#x00e8;ge militaire royal de Saint-Jean</a>).  It was a satellite campus set up on September 26, 1945 by <a>McGill University</a> to handle the overflow registration of students after the <a>Second World War</a> and the returning veterans.  Those students in the first 3 years of the Faculty of Engineering were taught there, thus relieving the McGill campus for the later 2 years for the degree course.  That version of Dawson College was closed in May 1950.</p>
<p>The college traces its origins to the merger of several institutions which became public in 1967, when the Quebec system of CEGEPs was created. The current Dawson College was the first English-language institution in the Quebec network of CEGEPs when it opened its doors to 1,200 students in the fall of 1969. The College is named for <a>Sir William Dawson</a>, a principal of <a>McGill University</a> from 1855 to 1893.</p>
<p>The College was originally housed in a converted pharmaceutical factory at 350 Selby Street in Westmount. In 1970, a second campus (used mostly for Creative Arts programs) was opened on Viger Street just to the north of <a>Old Montreal</a>. Two years later, its third campus was opened near <a>Parc Lafontaine</a>.  By 1988 Dawson either still or had also operated the Richelieu campus in <a>St. Henri</a>, the DeLorimier campus, the Victoria campus on <a>McGill Street</a> (in Old Montreal), with additional facilities on <a>Saint Catherine Street</a> among other locations.</p>
<p>In 1988, Dawson College occupied the former Mother House of the Congr&#x00e9;gation de Notre-Dame. Full consolidation under one roof only happened in 1997, when the Selby building was finally closed. Extensive renovations transformed the century-old building into an attractive, modern, and well-equipped college, occupying an entire city block between <a>de Maisonneuve Boulevard</a> and <a>Sherbrooke Street</a> and <a>Wood Avenue</a> in Westmount and <a>Atwater Street</a> in Montreal.</p>
<h2>Dawson Student Union</h2>
<p><a>right|thumb|200px|Dawson College</a>  The Dawson Student Union (DSU) is the <a>students' union</a> representing the approximately 7,000 full-time students at Dawson.  It claims to fund, coordinate and regulate <a>club</a>s and activities, as well as being a resource for students to direct them to appropriate departments or services or inform them of their rights and lobby for them, if necessary.</p>
<p>In April 2005, the DSU was accredited by the Quebec Government (as per <a>R.S.Q. ch A-3.01</a>) after the largest student turnout in the college's history.  About 70% of students voted in favour of accreditation (comprising about 27% of the total full-time student population).</li>
