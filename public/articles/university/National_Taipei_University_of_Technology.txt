<p>The <strong>National Taipei University of Technology</strong> is located in the <a>Daan District</a> of <a>Taipei City</a>, <a>Taiwan</a>. The university traces its origins to the establishment of the School of Industrial Instruction in 1912.  </p>
<p>This institution underwent several name changes and reorganization during the Japanese colonial period in <a>Taiwan</a>.  By the time the ROC government moved to Taiwan, this technical institution was renamed Provincial Taipei Institute of Technology and served as a junior <a>vocational technical college</a>.  In 1981, it was renamed <em>National Taipei Institute of Technology</em>, and in the 1990s upgraded its junior college status to that of a university, resulting in the final name change to <em>National Taipei University of Technology</em> (&#x570b;&#x7acb;&#x53f0;&#x5317;&#x79d1;&#x6280;&#x5927;&#x5b78;) in 1997.  The university currently has 383 full-time faculty members.</p>
<p>The university is headed by Dr. Tsu-tian Lee, who serves as the president.</p>
