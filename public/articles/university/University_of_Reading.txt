<p> The <strong>University of Reading</strong> is a <a>university</a> in the <a>English</a> town of <a>Reading</a>, <a>Berkshire</a>. One of the so-called <a>&quot;red brick&quot; universities</a>, it was established in 1892 as <strong>University College, Reading</strong> and received its <a>Royal Charter</a> in 1926. It is based on several campuses in, and around, the town of Reading.</p>
<p>The University has a long tradition of research, education and training at a local, national and international level. It offers traditional degrees and also less usual and other vocationally relevant ones. It was awarded the <a>Queen's Anniversary Prize</a> for Higher and Further Education in 1998, 2005 and again in 2009. It is one of the ten most research-intensive universities in the UK, and is ranked in the top 2.5% of universities in the world.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left|upright|The University War Memorial clock tower, on the London Road Campus</a> The University owes its origins to the Schools of Art and Science established in Reading in 1860 and 1870. These became part of an extension college of <a>Christ Church</a> of the <a>University of Oxford</a> in 1892, which became known as University College, Reading.</p>
<p>The new college received its first treasury grant in 1901. Three years later it was given a site, in London Road,  by the Palmer family of <a>Huntley &amp; Palmers</a> fame. The same family's continued support enabled the opening of <a>Wantage Hall</a> in 1908 and the Research Institute in Dairying in 1912.</p>
<p>In October 2006, the Senior Management Board proposed the closure of its Physics Department to future undergraduate application. This was ascribed to financial reasons and lack of alternative ideas and caused considerable controversy, not least a debate in <a>Parliament</a> over the closure which prompted heated discussion of higher education issues in general. On October 10 the Senate voted to close the Department of Physics, a move confirmed by the Council on November 20.  Other departments closed in recent years include Music, Sociology, Geology, and Mechanical Engineering.  The university council decided in March 2009 to close the School of Health and Social Care, a school whose courses have consistently been oversubscribed.</p>
<p>In January 2008, the University announced its merger with the <a>Henley Management College</a> to create the university's new <em>Henley Business School</em>, bringing together Henley College's expertise in MBAs with the University's existing Business School and <a>ICMA Centre</a>. The merger took formal effect on the 1st August 2008, with the new business school split across the university's existing Whiteknights Campus and its new Greenlands Campus that formerly housed Henley Management College.  A further restructuring announced in September 2009 portends the loss of additional jobs, in the film, theatre and television department.</p>
<h2>Campuses</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|Sibly Hall</a> <a>thumb|right|The University Great Hall, on the London Road Campus</a> <a>thumb|thumb|right|Greenlands Campus, used by the Business School</a> The University maintains over  of grounds, in four distinct campuses:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>Whiteknights Campus</a>, at , is the largest and includes Whiteknights Lake, conservation meadows and woodlands as well as most of the University's departments. The campus takes its name from the nickname of the 13th century <a>knight</a>, <a>John De Erleigh IV</a> or the 'White Knight', and was landscaped in the 18th century by <a>Marquis of Blandford</a>. The main University library, in the middle of the campus, holds nearly a million books and subscribes to around 4,000 periodicals.</li>
  <li>The smaller <a>London Road Campus</a> is the original University site and is closer to the town centre of Reading. The London Road site forms the base for the majority of the university's extramural and <a>distance learning</a> activities, and is home to the Centre for Continuing Education and the Professional Management Programmes as well as the Museum of English Rural Life. Moreover, it plays host to the University graduation ceremonies twice a year, in the Great Hall. London Road is currently undergoing extensive renovation to allow a number of departments to move from Bulmershe from 2011.</li>
  <li>The <a>Bulmershe Court Campus</a> in <a>Woodley</a> is the site of the former Bulmershe Teaching College, which merged with The University of Reading in 1989. The campus is now the home of The Institute of Education and the Department of Film, Theatre and Television, alongside the Bulmershe site of Students&#x2019; Union, Breeze Bar, and Bulmershe Hall of Residences. It also has the largest hall of residence of the University. Furthermore, the campus hosts a range of the University's home sporting fixtures, including football, basketball and American Football. Bulmershe is currently due for closure in 2011 with departments moving to either London Road or Whiteknights Campuses.</li>
  <li>The <a>Greenlands Campus</a>, on the banks of the <a>River Thames</a> in <a>Buckinghamshire</a>. Once the home of <a>William Henry Smith</a>, founder of <a>WH Smith</a>, and latterly the site of the <a>Henley Management College</a>, this campus became part of the university on the 1st August 2008, with the merger of that college with the university's Business School to form the <em>Henley Business School</em>. The school's <a>MBA</a> and corporate learning offerings will be based at Greenlands, with undergraduate and other postgraduate courses being based at Whiteknights. The University also intends to site some functions on the London Road site, with a complete withdrawal from Bulmershe Court proposed by 2012.</p>
<h2>Research</h2>
<p>In the <a>Research Assessment Exercise</a> in 2001, five departments were awarded the top rate of 5* &#x2013; <a>Archaeology</a>, <a>English</a>, <a>Italian</a>, <a>Meteorology</a> and <a>Psychology</a>, and fifteen departments were awarded the rating of 5. In the wake of the 2008 RAE, the university saw a cut of &#x00a3;4m (19%) in its recurrent research funding, the largest cut among the <a>1994 Group</a> of British universities.</p>
<p>The Department of Meteorology was awarded a <a>Queen&#x2019;s Anniversary Prize for Higher and Further Education</a> in 2005.  Reading was the first university to win a <a>Queen's Award for Export Achievement</a>, in 1989.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Community</h2>
<p>In the 2004&#x2013;05 academic year, the university had 4,024 staff and 15,326 students.</p>
<p><a>Reading University Students' Union</a> is the affiliated student organisation which represents the students' interests. The Students' Union publishes <a>Spark*</a>, a bi-weekly newspaper aimed at the student population of the University, which was weekly until October 2006 (it is now published fortnightly during term-time) and runs the student radio station <a>Junction11</a>. The latest addition to its media contingency is the student run television station <a>RU:ON</a>. The university also has a number of <a>Junior Common Room</a>s that are nominally independent from the Students' Union and the University.</p>
<p>The Students' Union building on Whiteknights Campus contains an 1800 capacity venue called 3sixty, two bars, a number of retail outlets, and The Hub. The Hub is the Union's new volunteer, advice, student activity centre, cost around &#x00a3;1.8m and was officially opened in March 2007 by <a>Bill Rammell</a> MP, Minister for Higher Education.</p>
<h2>University halls and accommodation</h2>
<p>Student <a>accommodation</a> is provided in a number of halls of residence offering a mix of partially catered (19 meals per week) and self-catering accommodation, along with other self-catering accommodation. Following a major review the University is now preceding with the integrated Halls and Catering Strategy, that will see several halls replaced as well as new ones created with social, catering &amp; welfare facilities provided in hub areas. Most of the halls of residence lie close to the northern campus periphery and in residential areas close by.</p>
<p>Halls are managed in groups which are <strong>Lakeside</strong> (<a>Bridges</a>, Bulmershe &amp; Wessex), <strong>Northcourt</strong> (Sibly, Sherfield, Student Village (managed by UPP) and St. Patrick's), <strong>Park</strong> (Greenow, McCombie, MacKinder, Stenton, Windsor and Dunsden Crescent), <strong>Redlands</strong> (Hillside, Martindale, St. George's, Wells and <a>Wantage</a>) and <strong>Estates Management</strong> (35 Upper Redlands Road, Mansfield and St. David's).</p>
<p>The former St. Andrews Hall closed in 2001, and is now the home of the <a>Museum of English Rural Life</a>.</p>
<p>St. George's Hall and The Reading Student Village are leased back to the University from <a>UJC</a><img>. The cost of leasing back the Student Village to the University, according to the University accounts, was &#x00a3;1.5 million for 2003&#x2013;04 and &#x00a3;1.3 million in 2002&#x2013;03.</p>
<h2>Societies</h2>
<p>The University of Reading has 60 societies open to and run by its students.</p>
<p>The University also has its very own Scottish Highland Bagpipe &amp; Drum Band, <a>Reading University Pipe Band</a>, who teach the <a>Great Highland Bagpipes</a> and also serve students and staff as the University of Reading's Scottish Society.</p>
<h2>Student media</h2>
<p>Students run a full complement of student media, which includes;</p>
<ul>
  <li>TV station: <a>RU:ON</a></li>
  <li>Radio station: <a>Junction11</a></li>
  <li>Newspaper: <a>Spark*</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Museums, libraries and botanical gardens</h2>
<p><a>thumb|right|The Main Library on the Whiteknights Campus</a> Reading University maintains four <a>museum</a>s, two campus libraries and a range of inter-departmental libraries, and a <a>botanical garden</a>. The largest and best known of these museum is the <a>Museum of English Rural Life</a>, which has recently relocated from a location on Whiteknights Campus to a site nearer the town centre on the London Road Campus. The <a>Ure Museum of Greek Archaeology</a>, the <a>Cole Museum of Zoology</a>, the <a>University of Reading Herbarium</a> and the <a>Harris Garden</a> are all on the Whiteknights Campus.</p>
<p>The Whiteknights Main Library holds catalogue of over 1.2 million books, as well as a range of electronic resources, videos and archives. All in 14,000 square metres of public space on five floors of resources, a maintenance floor, entrance plaza and the Knowledge Exchange. The secondary library on the University's Bulmershe Campus supports teaching courses and provides resources in education, health &amp; social care, music, and film &amp; drama. There is also a library in the University's Meteorology department.</p>
<h2>Working with business</h2>
<p>Reading hosts a number of private sector businesses on its campuses, either occupying dedicated buildings or in managed space at the Science &amp; Technology Centre or Enterprise Hub.</p>
<p><a>thumb|right|The Science &amp; Technology Centre</a></p>
<h3>Science &amp; Technology Centre</h3>
<p>The University of Reading Science &amp; Technology Centre is situated on the eastern side of Whiteknights Campus. The Science &amp; Technology Centre supports and accommodates technology companies from start-up through to larger <a>SME</a>s.</p>
<p>The following notable companies are based at, or have been based at, the Science &amp; Technology Centre:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>Assuria Ltd</a></li>
  <li><a>Reading Scientific Services Ltd</a></li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><a>thumb|right|The former Reading Enterprise Hub on Whiteknights Campus</a></p>
<h3>Reading Enterprise Hub</h3>
<p>Reading Enterprise Hub is a <a>business incubator</a> opened in 2003. The hub was jointly sponsored by the university and <a>SEEDA</a>, and sought to attract startup high tech companies, particularly those with interests in <a>environmental technology</a>, <a>information technology</a>, <a>life sciences</a>, and <a>materials science</a>.</p>
<p>The hub was originally situated in <a>World War 2</a> era temporary office buildings on the university's Whiteknights campus. During the summer of 2008 the hub was demolished, along with the neighbouring former <a>agriculture</a> buildings, and the remaining tenants relocated to a building on the London Road campus. As of April 2010, a new Reading Enterprise Centre is being constructed on the hub's original site.</p>
<h3>Dedicated buildings</h3>
<p>Besides its use of the Science &amp; Technology Centre, Reading Scientific Services also occupies the Reading Science Centre, situated on the western side of Whiteknights campus.</p>
<h2>Associated institutions</h2>
<p> Formerly associated with Reading University was Gyosei International College, a <a>Japan</a>ese/<a>British</a> bi-cultural institution established on part of the University's original London Road Campus. Subsequently the college's links with the Japan-based <a>Gyosei</a> organisation were broken, and it became a charitably funded institution called Witan Hall. This was purchased by the University of Reading, ceased student recruitment and finally closed in March 2008.</p>
<p>The University of Reading Law faculty is also associated with <a>Taylors College</a> in <a>Malaysia</a>.  Taylors College conducts a 'twinning' program whereby students complete half of their degree in Malaysia and the other half at the University of Reading. Malaysian Law students in Reading generally achieve a second class upper average, and have set a high standard for Malaysian Law students.</p>
<p>Located on Reading University's Whiteknights campus is The <a>College of Estate Management</a> (CEM). The College was founded in 1919 and granted its Royal Charter in 1922. It was originally based in London but moved to Reading in 1969, leading to the foundation of the Faculty of Urban and Regional Studies (URS) at the University. The College provides education and training for students and members of the property and construction professions worldwide through distance learning. Courses are delivered by the provision of printed material sent to students by post and through web-based learning.</p>
<p>The <a>Walker Institute</a>, a centre for climate research, is based at the University of Reading.</p>
<h2>Governance</h2>
<h3>Governing bodies and roles</h3>
<p>The university is nominally led by a <a>Chancellor</a>, who is the titular head of the university, and is normally a well-known public figure. The day to day chief executive role is the responsibility of the <a>Vice-Chancellor</a>, a full time academic post. The senior management board of the university is headed by the Vice-Chancellor, assisted by a Deputy-Vice-Chancellor, three Pro-Vice-Chancellors, four Deans and five Heads of Directorate. It is responsible for the day-to-day management of the University and meets fortnightly throughout most of the year.</p>
<p>The senior management board reports to the university's Senate, the main academic administrative body. The senate has around 100 members and meets at least four times a year and advises on areas such as student entry, assessment and awards. Membership includes Deans, Heads and elected representatives of Schools, as well as professional staff and students. The Senate in turn reports to the Council, which is the supreme governing body of the university, setting strategic direction, ensuring compliance with statutory requirements and approving constitutional changes. The Council meets four times a year, and comprises a broad representation of lay members drawn from commercial, community and professional organisations.</p>
