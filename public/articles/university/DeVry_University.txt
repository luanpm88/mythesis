<h2>History</h2>
<p>DeVry was founded in Chicago and opened in 1931 as the <strong>DeForest Training School</strong>, named after <a>Lee DeForest</a>, a colleague and friend of founder Dr. Herman A. DeVry. In 1953, the name changed to <strong>DeVry Technical Institute</strong> in dedication to its founder. In 1966 the school was acquired by the <a>Bell and Howell</a> company, and became part of its Education Group division. In 1985 The Bell &amp; Howell Education Group became known as <strong>DeVry Institutes</strong>,  which was sold to <strong>Keller-Taylor Corporation</strong>, parent company of the Keller Graduate School of Management in 1987 to become <a>DeVry, Inc.</a>. DeVry acquired <a>Ohio Institute of Technology</a> in 1968, Becker Professional Review in 1996, <a>Ross University</a> in 2003, and the <a>Deaconess College of Nursing</a> in 2005. DeVry did not acquire rights to use the name &quot;Deaconess College of Nursing&quot;, so it was renamed &quot;Chamberlain&quot; in 2006.</p>
<h3>Ohio Institute of Technology</h3>
<p>The <strong>Ohio Institute of Technology</strong> (OIT) was a trade school that operated in <a>Columbus, Ohio</a>, <a>United States</a> from 1952 until being renamed as part of the DeVry Institute of Technology in 1983 (and later DeVry University).</p>
<p>An unaffiliated school by the same name was founded in 2002, and functioned mainly as an auxiliary educational organization within the <a>State of Ohio</a> for accredited public Universities, Community Colleges and Joint Vocational Schools.  OIT&#x2019;s core curriculum focused primarily on industry recognized <a>information technology</a> certifications.</p>
<h3>Ohio Technical College</h3>
<p>Ohio Technical College was founded in 1952 and later changed its name to Ohio Institute of Technology. In 1968, the school was acquired by the <a>Bell &amp; Howell Education Group</a>, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bell &amp; Howell Company.  In September 1971 a new facility was opened at 1350 Alum Creek Drive in Columbus.  DeVry Institute of Technology later changed its name to DeVry University-Columbus to match its sister colleges.</p>
<p>After years of non-use, the trade name Ohio Institute of Technology, was reissued in 2002 to NTI, Inc.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>&lt;small&gt;      &lt;/small&gt;</p>
<h3>Former</h3>
<p>DeVry had 3 campuses in the Greater Toronto Area. The North York campus at Finch Avenue West and Highway 400 moved to Progress Avenue in Scarborough (closed 2003). Another campus was located in Mississauga on Chedworth Way was opened in 1997. Both locations closed and operations re-located to Calgary in 2003.</p>
<h2>Controversies</h2>
<p>In 1995, DeVry was suspended from <a>Ontario's student loan program</a> after a large number of its students misreported their income. DeVry was reinstated after paying fines of <a>CAD$</a>1.7 million and putting up a bond of <a>CAD$</a>2 million.</p>
<p>In 1996, students of DeVry's <a>Toronto</a> campus filed a <a>class-action</a> suit claiming poor educational quality and job preparation; the suit was dismissed on technical grounds.</p>
<p>In November 2000, Afshin Zarinebaf, Ali Mousavi and another graduate of one of DeVry University&#x2019;s Chicago-area campuses filed a class-action lawsuit accusing DeVry of widespread deception, unlawful business practices and false advertising and alleging that students were not being prepared for high tech jobs. The lawsuit contributed to a 20% slide in the company's stock. The class was not certified and the case was resolved for less than $25,000 in June 2006. This decision was opposed by the <a>Alberta New Democratic Party</a> (sitting in opposition), the <a>University of Calgary</a> Faculty Association, the <a>Canadian Federation of Students</a>, and the <a>Canadian Association of University Teachers</a>. (The concerns raised are similar to those about other private institutions). The NDP claimed <a>conflict of interest</a> as John Ballheim served as both the president of DeVry's Calgary campus and a member of the <a>Premier of Alberta</a>'s special advisory council on postsecondary education.</p>
<p>In January 2002, Royal Gardner, a graduate of one of DeVry University&#x2019;s Los Angeles-area campuses, filed a <a>class-action</a> <a>complaint</a> against DeVry Inc. and DeVry University, Inc. on behalf of students in the post-baccalaureate degree program in Information Technology.  The suit alleged that the nature of the program was misrepresented by the advertising.  The lawsuit was dismissed and refiled.  During the first quarter of 2004, a new complaint was filed in the same court by Gavino Teanio with the same general allegations.  This action was stayed pending the outcome of the Gardner lawsuit.  The lawsuits were being settled in late 2006.</p>
<p>In April 2007 the State of New York settled with three schools that were participating in questionable student loan practices. DeVry, Career Education Corporation, and <a>Washington University in St. Louis</a> were involved with the settlement. DeVry agreed to refund $88,122 back to students.</p>
