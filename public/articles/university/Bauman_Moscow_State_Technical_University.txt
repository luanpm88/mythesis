<p>  The <strong>Bauman Moscow State Technical University</strong>, Bauman MSTU (), sometimes colloquially referred to as the Bauman School or Baumanka () is a <a>public university</a> located in <a>Moscow</a>, <a>Russia</a>.  Bauman MSTU is one of the oldest and largest Russian <a>technical university</a> offering <a>B.S.</a>, <a>M.S.</a> and <a>Ph.D.</a> degrees in various engineering fields and applied sciences.</p>
<h2>University today</h2>
<p>From 1918 to 2010 more than 144,000 students graduated with different engineering degrees.  Most of them chose to become scientists or engineers in the leading research centers, universities, private and government owned companies. Some of the specialized departments of BMSTU are located outside Moscow in cities of <a>Moscow Oblast</a>: <a>Krasnogorsk</a> (Russian: &#x041a;&#x0440;&#x0430;&#x0441;&#x043d;&#x043e;&#x0433;&#x043e;&#x0440;&#x0441;&#x043a;), <a>Reutov</a> (Russian: &#x0420;&#x0435;&#x0443;&#x0442;&#x043e;&#x0432;), <a>Korolev</a> (Russian: &#x041a;&#x043e;&#x0440;&#x043e;&#x043b;&#x0451;&#x0432;).  There is also a <a>largest branch</a> of the University in <a>Kaluga</a> (Russian: &#x041a;&#x0430;&#x043b;&#x0443;&#x0433;&#x0430;).</p>
<h2>Educational programs</h2>
<p>The academic year in this university begins on the 1st September, and is divided into two terms (semesters). Students take exams at the end of each semester.  The course of study lasts 6 years without interrupt for engineer specialist degree. But over the last few years the Bauman University has continued to integrate with the <a>Bologna Process</a>. And today some students learn using two step educational system.   The first two years students study general engineering subjects. In the third year students begin to study specialized subjects.  In this university theoretical subjects accompanied by practical training. Students begin to work at the University's well-equipped (Russian standard) laboratories and in senior years at various plants, design offices and research institutes of Russia.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The university was established in 1830 as <em>Imperial Vocational School</em> (, <em>Remeslennoe Uchilische</em>) by a decree of Emperor <a>Nicholas I</a>.  It was renamed in 1868 as <em>Imperial Moscow Technical School</em>, then after the 1917 revolution to <em>Moscow Highest Technical School</em> (MHTS).  A number of research institutes such as <a>TsAGI</a> were created from laboratories and departments of MHTS in 1930.  The remaining school was named <em><a>Bauman</a> Moscow Mechanical and Machine Construction Institute</em>, after the revolutionary <a>Bolshevik</a> <a>Nikolay Bauman</a>.  The name MHTS was revived in 1943.  The current name was given in 1989.</p>
