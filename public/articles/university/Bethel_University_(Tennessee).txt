<p><strong>Bethel University</strong> is a <a>Cumberland Presbyterian</a> college in <a>McKenzie, Tennessee</a>.</p>
<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>It was founded in 1842 in <a>McLemoresville, Tennessee</a> as <strong>Bethel Seminary</strong>, becoming <strong>Bethel College</strong> in 1850, and given a state charter in 1847, making it one of the oldest colleges to use the name &quot;Bethel College.&quot;</p>
<p>There was a brief time during the <a>American Civil War</a> that the college was closed but it was reopened as a co-educational institution in 1865 under the leadership of Dr. <a>Benjamin Wilburn McDonnold</a>. The college relocated in 1872 to its current campus in McKenzie.  In 1906 when the Union (a church governing body) closed all ten Cumberland Presbyterian colleges, only Bethel reopened, becoming, as it remains, the only Cumberland Presbyterian college.  Bachelors and Masters degrees are available through Bethel University.  The sports teams are nicknamed the Wildcats and the Lady Wildcats.  They participate in the <a>NAIA</a>'s <a>TranSouth</a> and <a>Mid-South Conference</a>s.  The school also maintains satellite campuses in Nashville, Memphis, Chattanooga, and Jackson Tennessee to house their &quot;Success Program&quot; campuses aimed at the <a>non-traditional student</a>. In addition, Bethel University also offers MBA and MAEd programs through their Nashville satellite campus.</p>
