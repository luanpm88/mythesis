<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|Constantine Building</a></p>
<p>While it was clear enough that, when the time came for a successor to the <a>Middlesbrough</a>-based <a>Mechanics' Institute</a> of 1844, a new technical college was in order, a shortage of funding long proved a barrier to any such plan. The College's launch could otherwise have come as early as 1914. Even after the donation of &#x00a3;40,000 to build the college from local shipping <a>magnate</a> Joseph Constantine in 1916, progress was slow. A Governing Council took place in 1922, followed by a doubling of the original financial offer by the Constantine family in 1924. For the task of constructing the first Technical College building, Mr Graham R. Dawbarn (a <a>London</a> architect also responsible for additions to <a>Corpus Christi College</a>, <a>Cambridge</a>) was appointed on 29 March 1926. Building work finally kicked into action in 1927, culminating in the beginning of enrollment and teaching formalities on 16 September 1929.  But the fanfare had to wait, until the turn of the decade, in order to accommodate the royal schedule.</p>
<p>Constantine Technical College was nonetheless finally opened on 2 July 1930 by the future King Edward VIII, the <a>Prince of Wales</a>. Although not yet a <a>university</a>, from the outset, Constantine was both a <a>further</a> and <a>higher education</a> college. While at one end of the spectrum students at Constantine could be as young as 15, also publicised in its Prospectus were <a>degree courses</a> validated by the <a>University of London</a>. Star disciplines included <a>metallurgy</a>, <a>engineering</a> and <a>chemistry</a>. Five rooms were also reserved for an <a>art</a> department, until cramped accommodation forced the <a>School of Art</a> to split from its parent site for the 1950s.</p>

<p>The 1960s were years of sweeping change &#x2013; as well as political sting &#x2013; for the still comparatively fledgling College. By the end of the decade the first two &quot;Teesside University&quot; campaigns had begun: the first, from the early 1960s to 1966, and the second, from 1967 to 1972, spates of enthusiasm killed off on each occasion only by the scepticism of then-<a>Minister of Education</a>, <a>Anthony Crosland</a>, and <a>Margaret Thatcher</a>'s defining White Paper, respectively. The latter effectively shelved plans for the erection of any new institution in the <a>United Kingdom</a>, until the 1980s at least.</p>
<p>On campus, one of the most visible major developments for the College was an extension comprising an 11-<a>storey</a> &quot;skyscraper&quot;, on which construction work began in 1963. The College acquired the neighbouring former High School of 1877. The College briefly restyled itself <em>Constantine College of Technology</em>, before becoming a <a>polytechnic</a> (<a>Britain</a>'s 13th) in 1969. At that point, the institution boasted 17 degree courses.</p>
<p>A merger with Teesside College of Education took place in the 1970s along with the purchase of Flatts Lane. The Clarendon Building was added in 1973, as was the Stephenson Building in 1976, with both remaining in use for the Polytechnic's long-awaited conversion into a University. That happened on 16 June 1992, when Teesside Polytechnic became one of the United Kingdom's first <a>new universities</a>, following that year's <a>Further and Higher Education Act</a>.</p>

<p>By the 1990s student numbers were nearing the 8,000 mark, but only in 1997 was the old Polytechnic's library replaced, by a Learning Resource Centre. Subsequent additions included the Virtual Reality Centre and Centre for Enterprise, as well as, more recently, the Phoenix and Athena Buildings. Today, historic structures such as the old High School (the Waterhouse building), the Constantine building and Victoria Building of 1891 (a schoolyard-equipped <a>Victorian</a> school, housing a series of graduate business incubator units), are all Grade II <a>listed building</a>s.</p>
<p>In 2009, the University of Teesside changed its name to &quot;Teesside University&quot;, changed its logo and adopted the motto &quot;Inspiring success&quot; as part of a rebrand that cost &#x00a3;20,000. Alternative names also suggested included &quot;Middlesbrough University&quot; and &quot;Tees Valley University&quot;.</p>
<p>On 15 October 2009, Teesside University was elected <em>University of the Year</em> and <em>Outstanding Employer Engagement Initiative</em> in the <a>Times Higher Education</a> Awards.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p><a>thumb|View of the clock tower from Albert Road</a> The University has been situated since its formation as Constantine Technical College in 1930 within the <a>borough of Middlesbrough</a> in the <a>North Yorkshire</a> area of <a>England</a> on the south banks of the <a>River Tees</a>.  Transport links exist via the <a>A19</a> and <a>A66 road</a>s. The University's entrance is at the site of the old Constantine College building, fronted by the Waterhouse clock tower.</p>
<p>The University has opened its temporary campus Teesside University Darlington, in the former Eastbourne Secondary School in the Eastbourne area of Darlington. Its new state of the art campus will open in 2011 with work starting on site in April 2010. The new campus will be on the Darlington College site, in the Central Park regeneration area next to the East Coast mainline railway station.</p>
<p>Further investment at the main campus site in Middlesbrough includes the new &#x00a3;17m Centuria South building for dental training and sports therapy, planned to open in Autumn 2010.  Also planned to open in Autumn 2010 are two new higher education centres in Hartlepool and Redcar. </p>
<h2>Academic life</h2>
<p>The University has been ranked second place of all English universities by the Funding Council for attracting students from atypical addresses, and has won seven <a>National Teaching Fellowship</a>s.</p>
<p>The construction of an &#x00a3;11m Institute of Digital Innovation, as part of the 2010 DigitalCity project is now underway and the <a>Animex International Festival</a> is also staged there on an annual basis, complementing the University's coverage of <a>animation</a> and <a>computer games</a>. It is also home to the <a>Northern Region Film and Television Archive</a>.</p>
<p>The <a>Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education</a> has thus far identified units of teaching &quot;excellence&quot; in <a>Art</a> &amp; <a>Design</a>, <a>computer science</a>, <a>history</a>, <a>social work</a>, <a>sport</a> and <a>exercise</a>, electrical and electronic <a>engineering</a>, <a>nursing</a>, the <a>Foundation Degree</a> in chemical technology and a number of subjects allied to <a>medicine</a>.</p>
<p>The first <a>National Student Survey</a> disclosed its findings in September 2005. Over the full range of criteria, the University scored 4/5 for overall student satisfaction - level with institutions such as <a>Leeds</a> and <a>Newcastle</a>. Within Teesside, <a>English</a>, <a>Law</a> and Art &amp; Design fared best, with all three areas within the top 25 per cent of student satisfaction nationally.  In the resulting overall &quot;league table&quot;, the University was ranked joint 34th of 101 institutions. It was also during this year that the University scaled the national top 20 for graduate further study or employment in <em>The Times Good University Guide 2005</em>; Teesside was the highest ranked <a>new university</a>.</p>
<p>The 2006 <em>Times Good University Guide</em> and <em>The Sunday Times</em> university league table ranked Teesside 91st out of 100 British universities and joint 75th of 119 institutions respectively, with the <a>National Student Survey</a> 2006 giving the institution's Art &amp; Design courses the top ranking nationally. According to the 2008 National Student Survey, 84 per cent of  degree students are happy with their course and the percentage of overall student satisfaction is up for the third year running.. Teesside University was named the Times Higher Education (THE) Awards University of the Year 2009.</p>
<p>Undergraduate application statistics for Autumn 2005 entry showed that Computer Art (applications up 41.7 per cent), Electronic and Electrical Engineering (up 30.4 per cent), Sociology (up 25.5 per cent), Psychology (up 18.09 per cent) and Law (applications up 16.8 per cent) were among the courses with the fastest growing popularity within the University.</p>
<p>The present <a>Vice-Chancellor</a> is Professor Graham Henderson. In April 2005, the University welcomed <a>Lord Sawyer</a> as its new <a>Chancellor</a>, succeeding the University's first ever Chancellor, <a>European Commission</a>er <a>Leon Brittan</a>.</p>
<h2>Research</h2>
<p>In <a>research</a>, the University offers an array of relevant routes of study resulting in the qualification of <a>MPhil</a>, <a>PhD</a>, MProf and <a>DProf</a>.
