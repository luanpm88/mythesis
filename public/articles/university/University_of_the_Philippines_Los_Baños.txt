<p> <a>thumb|300px|right|Palm trees line the entrance to UPLB</a> The <strong>University of the Philippines Los Ba&#x00f1;os</strong> (<strong>UP Los Ba&#x00f1;os</strong>, <strong>UPLB</strong> or colloquially <strong>&quot;Elbi&quot;</strong>) is a public university located in the towns of <a>Los Ba&#x00f1;os</a> and <a>Bay</a> in the province of <a>Laguna</a>, some 63 kilometers south of <a>Metro Manila</a>. It was founded by <a>American</a> <a>botanist</a> <a>Edwin B. Copeland</a> on March 6, 1909 as the <a>University of the Philippines College of Agriculture</a> (UPCA)-the first school of its kind in the <a>tropics</a> and the second oldest among the seven campuses affiliated with the <a>University of the Philippines</a> system.</p>
<p>UPLB has played an influential role in Asian <a>agriculture</a> and <a>biotechnology</a> due to its pioneering efforts in <a>plant breeding</a> and <a>bioengineering</a> focusing on the development of high-yielding and pest resistant crops. It has received a <a>Ramon Magsaysay Award</a> (regarded as Asia's <a>Nobel Prize</a>)</p>
<p>UPLB offers degree programs in the <a>natural sciences</a>, <a>engineering</a>, <a>formal sciences</a>, <a>social sciences</a> and <a>liberal arts</a> through its nine colleges and two schools. The <a>Professional Regulation Commission</a> also recognizes UPLB as a top performing school based on passing rates in professional <a>licensure</a> exams.</p>
<p>UPLB alumni have been recognized in a wide range of fields. Notable ones include national scientists, United Nations <a>IPCC</a> members (winner of the 2007 <a>Nobel Peace Prize</a>), Ramon Magsaysay awardees, fellows of the <a>Academy of Sciences for the Developing World</a>, academicians of the National Academy of Science and Technology, business leaders, government officials and artists.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Early History</h3>
<p>Seeing the need to set up an institution dedicated to research and education in <a>agriculture</a> and related disciplines to serve the new <a>colony</a>, the <a>Board of Regents</a> of the <a>American</a> <a>University of the Philippines</a> on March 6, 1909 established the College of Agriculture in <a>Los Ba&#x00f1;os, Laguna</a>. <a>Edwin B. Copeland</a>, a <a>plant physiology</a> <a>professor</a> and <a>Thomasite</a> from the <a>Philippine Normal College</a> in Manila was chosen as its first <a>dean</a>; Harold Cuzner, Edgar Ledyard, Carrie Ledyard and Sam Durham were Copeland&#x2019;s first academic staff. Classes were first held in June 1909 in the houses of faculty members and makeshift tents. A year later, structures for the college were completed in a 73-hectare abandoned <a>farmland</a> at the foot of <a>Mount Makiling</a>. A formal four-year <a>curriculum</a> was instituted in 1910.</p>
<h3>World War II</h3>
<p> The UPCA campus was chosen as an internment camp for <a>allied</a> nationals as well as a recuperative camp for Filipino war prisoners during the <a>Japanese occupation</a>, with Baker Hall as main internment building.</p>

US National Archives]] &lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: <a>thumb|150px|left|Philippine stamp commemorating the 50th anniversary of the raid at Los Ba&#x00f1;os</a> --&gt;</p>
<p>The campus became home to 8,146 <a>POW</a>s: 7,000 <a>Filipinos</a>, 1,527 <a>Americans</a>, 329 <a>British</a>, 133 <a>Australia</a>ns, 89 <a>Dutch</a>, 30 <a>Norwegians</a>, 22 <a>Poles</a>, 16 <a>Italians</a>, and 1 <a>Nicaragua</a>n during the occupation. Aside from twelve <a>US Navy</a> <a>nurses</a> and a few <a>servicemen</a>, most of the internees were civilian <a>businessmen</a>, <a>teachers</a>, <a>bankers</a>, and <a>missionaries</a> caught by the Japanese during the course of the war and incarcerated in various <a>POW</a> camps in the country.</p>
<p>In 1945 the Americans saw the need to rescue the prisoners in Los Ba&#x00f1;os. With the help of Filipino guerrillas and escaped prisoners, a rescue mission was carried out from February 21 to 23, 1945. 2,147 allied civilian and military internees were successfully liberated with minimal casualties.</p>
<p>A few days after the rescue, Japanese units led by the escaped Sadaaki Konishi returned to Los Ba&#x00f1;os. After seeing that the prisoners have escaped, the Japanese turned their wrath on the remaining civilians who had failed to heed the warning from the guerrillas to leave. With the help of pro-Japanese Filipinos known as <a>Makapili</a>, the soldiers massacred some 1,500 men, women and children and burned their houses. They did the same to residents of adjacent towns suspected of collaborating with the liberators. Konishi was eventually captured, tried, and sentenced to death by a war tribunal.</p>
<p>Despite the thousands of innocent civilians killed when the Japanese returned to Los Ba&#x00f1;os after the raid, it is nonetheless celebrated as one of the most successful rescue operations in modern military history.</p>
<h3>Post-war Reconstruction and Cornell University Partnership</h3>
<p>UPCA became the first unit of the <a>University of the Philippines</a> to open after the war when it resumed classes on July 25, 1945. In five years, with the help of war damage funds from the US, 80% of the physical plant had been restored.</p>

<h2>Campus Life</h2>
<p>[[Image:UPLB PPO at Umali.jpg|thumb|150px|left|The [[Philippine Philharmonic Orchestra]] at DL Umali Hall]] <a>thumb|150px|left|Vega Center, campus shopping and dining center</a> The university is home to hundreds of organizations, ranging from Greek-letter societies to religious groups. They sponsor plays, musical performances, quiz bees, high school camps, outreach programs and other activities.</p>
<p>DL Umali Hall, which serves as the main <a>auditorium</a>, usually hosts stage plays and musical performances. Smaller theaters such as the NCAS Auditorium at the Humanities and Social Sciences Building and SEARCA Auditorium are also favored venues. Baker Hall usually hosts rock concerts, dance parties and trade fairs, while the Seniors Social Garden is a preferred venue for garden shows, weddings and other intimate events.</p>
<p>The Student Union building houses the office of the campus paper UPLB Perspective, as well as a cafeteria, a duck pin bowling lane, internet stations, a table tennis center, school supplies stores and counseling offices.</p>
<p>Right outside campus are numerous <a>restaurant</a>s, <a>bars</a>, <a>caf&#x00e9;s</a> and <a>fastfood</a> chains. Since many students leave campus for their home cities/towns on Fridays, Thursday nights are usually the busiest and most vibrant. Vega Center and LB Square are among the favorite stomping grounds.</p>
<p>The university holds a major campus fair known as &quot;Feb Fair&quot; during <a>Valentine&#x2019;s Day</a> week. The fair was initially held to express opposition to <a>Martial Law</a> under former president <a>Ferdinand Marcos</a>, but has since evolved into the biggest social event on campus. Popular bands and other artists converge at the Freedom Park to perform before hundreds of students and visitors. Many student organizations also put up tents around the park.</p>
<h3>Student Government</h3>
<p>Most degree-granting units have student councils that hold activities similar to other student organizations, but are largely geared to benefit their constituent colleges. Each college is represented in the University Student Council (USC), the highest student policymaking body on campus. The two major <a>political parties</a> on campus are Buklod-UPLB and Sakbayan.</p>
<h3>Housing</h3>
<p>As a large residential university, several <a>dormitories</a> and planned communities are available both inside and outside the campus to accommodate students, faculty and researchers. On-campus accommodation include the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Co-ed Residence Hall</li>
  <li>Women's Residence Hall</li>
  <li>International House</li>
  <li>New Dorm</li>
  <li>Veterinary Medicine Residence Hall</li>
  <li>Forestry Residence Hall</li>
  <li>New Forestry Residence Hall</li>
  <li>Makiling Residence Hall</li>
  <li>Faculty Village</li>
  <li>Searca Dormitory and Hotel</li>
  <li>UPLB Guest House</li>
</ul>
<h3>Emergency Services</h3>
<p>The university maintains its own police force but is dependent on the municipal government and <a>IRRI</a> during fires and other emergencies. UPLB has a small hospital that serves the needs of faculty and students. Privately run Los Ba&#x00f1;os Doctors Hospital is also less than a kilometer away from UPLB's main entrance.</p>
