<p> <strong>Thayer School of Engineering</strong> is a <a>graduate school</a> at <a>Dartmouth College</a>, <a>Hanover, New Hampshire</a>, United States, whose faculty also double as the undergraduate Department of <a>Engineering Sciences</a>. The school was established in 1867 with funds from Brig. Gen. <a>Sylvanus Thayer</a>, known for his work in establishing an engineering curriculum at the <a>United States Military Academy</a> at <a>West Point, New York</a>. Located in a two-building complex along the <a>Connecticut River</a> on the Dartmouth campus, the Thayer School today offers undergraduate, master's, and doctoral degrees, as well as dual-degree programs with other local institutions. Over 350&nbsp;students are currently enrolled at Thayer, overseen by a faculty of 45 and preceded by over 4,000 living alumni of the school.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Thayer School is named for <a>Sylvanus Thayer</a>, a Dartmouth alumnus from the class of 1807. Thayer was known as &quot;the father of West Point&quot; for his sixteen-year superintendency at the <a>United States Military Academy</a>, where he developed an extensive engineering curriculum unlike any other in the United States at the time. After thirty years of professional service in the <a>Army Corps of Engineers</a>, Thayer endowed $70,000 to Dartmouth College in 1867 for the establishment of a school of engineering, initially called the Thayer School of Civil Engineering.]] The school opened four years later in 1871 with six students. The curriculum borrowed heavily from the model developed by Thayer at West Point; graduates of the two-year program were awarded a degree in <a>civil engineering</a> (C.E.). Robert Fletcher, the first director and dean of the school, was also its only instructor for several years. During the late 19th century and early 20th century, the school's enrollment, funding, and faculty size steadily increased.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>thumb|center|600px|The two buildings currently comprising the Thayer School are the MacLean Engineering Sciences Center (left) and Horace Cummings Memorial Hall (right).</a>  The Thayer School is located on the campus of <a>Dartmouth College</a>, which is situated in the rural, <a>Upper Valley</a> <a>New England</a> town of <a>Hanover, New Hampshire</a>. The campus of the Thayer School sits in a complex on the west side Dartmouth's campus near the <a>Connecticut River</a>. When classes first began in 1871, Sylvanus Thayer's endowment had not provided for a physical plant. Consequently, the school was an itinerant institution for many years, occupying parts of various College buildings and, at one point, a former structure of the <a>New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts</a>.</p>
<p>In 1938, Dartmouth president <a>Ernest Martin Hopkins</a> successfully lobbied the <a>Board of Trustees</a> to construct an independent facility for the school. $200,000 were spent to build Horace Cummings Memorial Hall, which with several major additions (built in 1945-46 and 1989) served as Thayer's only facility for nearly 70&nbsp;years. In 2004, construction began on the MacLean Engineering Sciences Center (ESC), which was completed in 2006. At the cost of nearly $21&nbsp;million, the new center adds both classroom and research space to the Thayer School.

<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>The Thayer School serves as both <a>Dartmouth College</a>'s undergraduate department of engineering, as well as a graduate school offering advanced degrees. Undergraduate <a>majors</a> can receive their <a>Bachelor of Arts</a> degree in engineering at the school, and may choose to continue on to earn a <a>Bachelor of Engineering</a> (B.E.) degree in an additional year or less. Thayer also offers a dual-degree program for undergraduates at other colleges who wish to earn their Bachelor's degree at their home institution and their B.E. at Thayer. As a College academic department, the school's undergraduate offerings are open to any Dartmouth student, including non-majors.</p>
<p>Thayer offers several <a>graduate degree</a> programs, including a <a>Master of Science</a> (M.S.) and <a>Doctor of Philosophy</a> (Ph.D) in engineering. The school also offers a <a>Master of Engineering Management</a> (M.E.M.) degree in conjunction with the adjacent <a>Tuck School of Business</a>, and a combination Ph.D/<a>Doctor of Medicine</a> (M.D.) from <a>Dartmouth Medical School</a>.</p>
<h3>Research and entrepreneurship</h3>
<p>The Thayer School emphasizes the cross-disciplinary nature of its research topics. In 2007, sponsored research at the school amounted to $16.2&nbsp;million. Research at Thayer is divided into three general &quot;focus areas&quot;: engineering in medicine, energy technologies, and complex systems. Projects within each focus area are divided by three &quot;research categories&quot;: <a>biomedical</a>, <a>biochemical</a>, <a>chemical</a> &amp; <a>environmental engineering</a> (BBCEE), <a>electrical</a> &amp; <a>computer engineering</a>, &amp; <a>engineering physics</a> (ECEEP), and <a>materials</a> &amp; mechanical systems engineering (MMSE). <a>thumb|left|The drawing room of the Thayer School in the early 1890s.</a> The Thayer School promotes its connections to engineering <a>entrepreneurship</a>. The Cook Engineering Design Center, founded in 1978, acts to solicit industry-sponsored projects for degree candidates to work on. The school also offers a variety of conferences, programs, and internships to foster student connections to the professional world. Companies and products that have emerged from the Thayer School include emeritus professor Robert Dean's <a>Creare, Inc.</a> and Dartmouth music professor <a>Jon Appleton</a>'s work on the <a>Synclavier</a> synthesizer. The school maintains a list of <a>startup companies</a> established by its current faculty.</p>
<h3>Rankings and admissions</h3>
<p>In 2007, the Thayer School was ranked 47th by <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></em> among American engineering schools. It was also included in <em><a>BusinessWeek</a><strong>s unranked list of 60 &quot;Best Design Schools in the World&quot;.</em></p>
<p>Admissions for undergraduate students are handled by <a>Dartmouth College</a>'s Office of Undergraduate Admissions. Admission to graduate programs, including the B.E. degree, requires an undergraduate background in engineering and mathematics or science. In the fall of 2006, Thayer accepted 14.5% of applicants overall. Average <a>Graduate Record Examination</a> (GRE) test scores of applicants in verbal, quantitative, and analytical sections were 601, 778, and 695, respectively.</p>
