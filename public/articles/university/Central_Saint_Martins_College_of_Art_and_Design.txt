The school has an international reputation for being one of the world's leading design institutions, and is particularly renowned for its degrees in fashion and fashion design. </p>
<h2>Profile</h2>
<p>Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design is widely regarded as one of the leading Art and Design institutions in the world. CSM was formed in 1989 from the merger of <strong>Central School of Art and Design</strong>, founded in 1896, and <strong>Saint Martins School of Art</strong>, founded in 1854. Central Saint Martins became a constituent College of  the <strong>London Institute</strong> in 1986, a federal body formed by the <a>Inner London Education Authority</a> to bring together <a>London</a>'s art, design, fashion and media schools into a collegiate structure for administrative purposes. The London Institute was granted University status and was renamed <a>University of the Arts London</a> in 2004. The <a>Drama Centre London</a>, founded in 1963, and the <a>Byam Shaw School of Art</a>, founded in 1910, joined Central Saint Martins in 1999 and 2003 as integral schools, maintaining their individual titles and teaching approaches. Central Saint Martins is currently collaborating with the <strong>London Studio Centre</strong> to develop new courses in dance and related disciplines. </p>
<p>Central Saint Martins remains one of London's most revered art and design institutions, producing some of the most important artists, designers and performers over the last 150 years and has developed an internationally recognised research profile as rated in the <a>Research Assessment Exercise</a> in 2001. The <a>Queen's Anniversary Prize</a> was awarded to Central Saint Martins for its significant contributions to the UK fashion industry and for nurturing the creativity of students in 1998. Central Saint Martins also attained <a>Skillset Media Academy</a> status in 2007, recognising the achievements in the area of <a>media</a> and <a>interactive design</a>. </p>
<p>Central Saint Martins establishes links between artistic practice, leading to research projects and employs graduates onto national and international design consultancy schemes through its Innovation Centre and Design Laboratory.  Central Saint Martins has become one of the largest providers of art and design education in the world  and has registered <a>museum</a> status for its historical and contemporary collections.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h4>Central School of Art and Design</h4>
<p>[[Image:Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design - Blue Plaque.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Central Saint Martins - [[William Lethaby]] <a>Blue Plaque</a> (2008)]]</p>
<p>The Central School of Art and Design, formerly the <strong>Central School of Arts and Crafts</strong>, was established by the <a>London County Council</a> in 1896 to provide specialist art teaching for workers in the craft industries. The school was intended to be a centre at which art scholars and students could be brought under the influence of established artists and employers. The aim was a direct outcome of the <a>Arts and Crafts movement</a> sponsored by <a>William Morris</a> and <a>John Ruskin</a>. <strong>The Royal Female School of Art</strong>, founded in 1842, was transferred to the London County Council and was incorporated into the Central School of Art and Design in 1908. The <a>architect</a>, <a>educationalist</a> and <a>conservationist</a> <a>William Lethaby</a> was a key figure in the foundation of the school and was appointed joint principal with <a>George Frampton</a> from 1896 to 1911. Under Lethaby the Central School of Art and Design was innovatory in both its educational objectives and teaching methods. The majority of teachers were successful practitioners of their crafts, and provided the school with a variety of practical skills and valuable contacts with the creative industries.</p>
<h4>Saint Martins School of Art</h4>
<p>The Saint Martins School of Art was established in 1854 and was founded by the authorities of <a>St Martin-in-the-Fields</a>. The vicar, <a>Reverend</a> M McKenzie, and others were concerned that industrial education should be developed and allied to the general education already provided by Church schools. Art education was intended to form part of this industrial instruction for apprentices. The school became independent of the <a>parish</a> in 1859. The school was recognised by the Technical Education Board of London County Council in 1894 and became part of the development of technical education taking place in London and Britain. The school became firmly established as one of the major <a>fine art</a> and <a>commercial</a> art schools, producing many well-known artists of the era.</p>
<p>The <em>Gilbert-Garret Competition for Sketching Clubs</em> was started in 1870 at Saint Martins School of Art, during Mr. John Parker's  term as headmaster, and was named after its first president, <a>Sir John Gilbert</a>. </p>
<h4>Drama Centre London</h4>
<p> The <a>Drama Centre London</a> was founded in 1963 by a breakaway group of teachers and students from the <a>Central School of Speech and Drama</a>, led by John Blatchley, Yat Malmgren and Christopher Fettes. The school is a member of the <a>Conference of Drama Schools</a> and its undergraduate <a>Acting</a> course is accredited by the <a>National Council for Drama Training</a>. The Drama Centre London merged with Central Saint Martins in 1999.</p>
<h4>Byam Shaw School of Art</h4>
<p>The Byam Shaw School of Art, founded by the artists <a>John Byam Shaw</a> and <a>Rex Vicat Cole</a> in 1910 as a school of <a>drawing</a> and <a>painting</a> (originally located in <a>Kensington</a>,  until its move to <a>Archway</a> in the 1990s), merged with Central Saint Martins in 2003.</p>
