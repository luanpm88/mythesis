In 2001 it became a member of the <a>Association of American Universities</a> (AAU), an invitation-only organization of the top research universities in the U.S., currently having 62 members. Stony Brook co-manages <a>Brookhaven National Laboratory</a> through Brookhaven Science Associates, a 50-50 partnership with <a>Battelle Memorial Institute</a>. Stony Brook is also one of only two public schools in New York to have a medical school and a dental school, the other being <a>State University of New York at Buffalo</a>.</p>
<h2>Research</h2>
<p>The School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences (SoMAS) is the SUNY center for marine and atmospheric research, education, and public service. More than 300 graduate and undergraduate students from 16 different nations currently work and study at SoMAS. The School's students study coastal oceanographic processes and atmospheric sciences in a natural and academic setting that offers abundant opportunities for conducting field work, solving real problems in both local and distant environments, and learning to express their opinions in the weekly seminars. The Marine Sciences Research Center, the original institute for marine studies, was incorporated into the new School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences (SOMAS) on June 15, 2007.</p>
<p>Also, the University co-manages <a>Brookhaven National Laboratory</a>, joining an elite group of universities &#x2013; including the <a>University of California</a>, <a>University of Chicago</a>, <a>Cornell</a>, <a>MIT</a>, and <a>Princeton University</a> &#x2013; that run federal laboratories. In the Physical Sciences, Mathematics and Engineering area, some of the research centers of Stony Brook University are the Institute for Mathematical Sciences, the <a>C. N. Yang Institute for Theoretical Physics</a>, and the[Nuclear Theory Institute, among others. In the biomedical sciences, Stony Brook houses the Center for Biotechnology and the Institute of Chemical Biology and Drug Discovery, among many others. In March, 2008, the University received $60 million endowment from <a>James Simons</a> to establish the <a>Simons Center for Geometry and Physics</a>.  The <a>Louis and Beatrice Laufer Center for Physical and Quantitative Biology</a> was established by a generous gift in 2008 from Dr. Henry Laufer.</p>
<p>In July 2007 Stony Brook &quot;won a grant from the Department of Defense to devise ways to prevent terrorists from corrupting computers, and another from the <a>Department of Homeland Security</a> to design a system to detect radiation without triggering false alarms.&quot;</p>
<p>The New York Center for Computational Sciences (NYCCS), formed in 2007, is a joint venture of Stony Brook University and <a>Brookhaven National Laboratory</a>. Its centerpiece is an 18 rack Blue Gene /L and 2 rack Blue Gene/P massively parallel supercomputer based on the IBM system-on-chip technology, also known as <a>New York Blue Gene supercomputer</a>. In the June 2008 Top 500 supercomputer rankings New York Blue Gene/L was ranked 17th, and Blue Gene/P was ranked 75th. The total peak performance for both Blue Gene/L and Blue Gene/P consists 103.22 teraflops (trillion floating-point calculations per second).</p>

<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>left|thumb|200px|West Campus's Academic Mall. Left, Melville Library.</a> <a>right|thumb|200px|Stony Brook University Medical Center</a></p>
<p>The main campus is located at the geographic midpoint of <a>Long Island</a>, approximately  east of <a>New York City</a> and  west of <a>Montauk</a>. Situated south of <a>New York State Route 25A</a> (a.k.a. North Country Road), the Stony Brook campus is divided into three parts: the West Campus, East Campus, and South Campus.</p>
<p>The West Campus houses the majority of academic buildings and campus housing. It is the location of the original buildings at the Stony Brook site, including Mendelsohn Quad, which now serves as a residential quad. In addition to this quad, there are five other residential quads located on the West Campus, in addition to apartments for both graduates and undergraduates. The residential quads surround the Academic Mall, which contains the academic buildings. In 2010, the first residence hall at Stony Brook meeting the highest standards for green building design was opened. The center of the mall is the <a>Frank Melville Jr. Memorial Library</a>, and around this building are academic buildings housing the arts, sciences, and engineering departments. The Student Activities Center is the focus of campus life and is located across from the library. The <a>Staller Center</a> sits adjacent to the library and contains the largest movie screen in <a>Long Island</a>'s <a>Suffolk County</a>. The <a>Stony Brook Sports Complex</a> holds various facilities for athletics and the largest gym in Suffolk County with a capacity of more than 5,000 people. Behind the Sports Complex sits the <a>Kenneth P. LaValle Stadium</a>, which seats 8,300.</p>
<p>The East Campus is separated from the West Campus by Nicolls Road. It is home to the <a>Stony Brook University Medical Center</a>. The hospital is the largest in Suffolk County, and the attached Health Sciences Center (HSC) and Basic Science Tower (BST) houses numerous laboratories, the medical school, and numerous Allied Health programs. The Chapin Graduate Apartment Complex and the Long Island High Technology Incubator can also be found on the East Campus.</p>
<p>The South Campus is the smallest of the three and is separated from the West Campus by the Ashley Schiff Forest Preserve. It is home to the School of Dental Medicine, the Marine Sciences Research Center, and the Cody Center for Autism and Developmental Disabilities.</p>
<h3>Campus Residence Halls</h3>
<p><a>right|thumb|200px|West Apartments</a> Campus residence halls are grouped into quads, with each quad consisting of three to six separate colleges. Each quad and residence hall has been named after someone who has made a significant contribution to his or her respective field in some way. However, in an effort to merge with the history of New York and Long Island, the person being recognized had to be either from New York/Long Island or have made their contribution to New York/Long Island.</p>

<h2>Branch campuses</h2>
<h3>Manhattan</h3>
<p> In 2002, the University established a presence in <a>Manhattan</a> with the opening of <a>Stony Brook Manhattan</a>. The original site is located on the 2nd floor of 401 Park Avenue South; a newer operation opened in late 2008 in the adjacent building on the third floor of 387 Park Avenue South. The twin  facilities allow Stony Brook to offer professional and graduate courses targeted towards students in the city, as well as undergraduate courses during the summer and winter sessions. The original location will close at the end of 2010 but the newer site will continue to provide academic opportunities.</p>
<h3>Southampton</h3>
<p> On March 24, 2006, the University completed the purchase of the  <a>Southampton College</a> (on the east end of Long Island) property from <a>Long Island University</a> with the intent to develop it as a full college campus focusing on academic programs related to the environment and sustainability. Stony Brook expanded its original program, started in the fall of 2005, when it offered an undergraduate marine sciences program, with teaching and research facilities at the campus leased from Long Island University. An enrollment of about 2,000 students is expected within the next five years. Professor Martin Schoonen was appointed interim dean of Southampton campus on August 3, 2006, and conservationist Mary Pearl was appointed dean and vice president in March 2009.</p>
<p>As of April 7, 2010, the University has suspended residential programs and transferred sustainability programs to the main campus. The change was prompted by severe state budget cuts. Although the Marine Sciences and Graduate Writing programs are still in session at Southampton, undergraduates have been relocated to the main campus. As a result of major losses, all dining services and retail operations have been suspended by the Faculty Student Association. The old LIU radio station and <a>National Public Radio</a> affiliate continues to operate on the campus leasing its space from Stony Brook University.</p>
<h3>Research and Development Campus</h3>
<p>On November 3, 2005, the University announced that it had formally acquired  of the adjacent Flowerfield property, originally owned by the <a>Gyrodyne Company of America</a>, through <a>eminent domain</a>, three years after the University had expressed its desire to acquire the property.</p>
<h2>Admissions</h2>
<p>Stony Brook University has become increasingly competitive as a result of an increase in applications to public schools during the recession. In 2010, the University decided to put a cap on admissions effective in 2011 as a result of a budget crisis. In 2010, 40.9% of 27,819 applications were accepted, with 2,700 of those 11,379 accepted students enrolling as freshmen in September.</p>
<p>;Academic Profile of enrolling freshmen</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>GPA</a>: 88 - 94 </li>
</ul>
<p>The middle 50% of the 2009 enrolled freshmen had the following score ranges:</p>
<ul>
  <li>SAT Math: 590-690</li>
  <li>SAT Critical Reading: 540-630</li>
  <li>SAT Writing: 530-630</li>
  <li>ACT: 25-29</li>
</ul>
<p>The average SAT score for the class of 2014 was 1251/1600</p>
