<p> <strong>University College London</strong> (<strong>UCL</strong>) is a public research <a>university</a> located in <a>London</a>, <a>United Kingdom</a> and the largest <a>constituent college</a> of the federal <a>University of London</a>. Founded in 1826, UCL was the first university institution to be founded in London and the first in England to be established on an entirely secular basis, to admit students regardless of their religion and to <a>admit women on equal terms with men</a>. UCL became one of the two founding colleges of the University of London in 1836.</p>
<p>UCL is organised into <a>eight constituent faculties</a>, within which there are over 100 departments, institutes and research centres. UCL's main campus is located in the <a>Bloomsbury</a> area of <a>Central London</a>, with a number of institutes and teaching hospitals located elsewhere in Central London. The UCL School of Energy and Resources is based in <a>Adelaide</a>, <a>Australia</a>. UCL is a major centre for biomedical research; it is part of three of the 12 biomedical research centres established by the <a>NHS</a> in <a>England</a> and is a founding member of <a>UCL Partners</a>, the largest <a>academic health science centre</a> in <a>Europe</a>. For the period 1999 to 2009 it was the 13th most-cited university in the world (and the most-cited university in Europe). UCL had a total income of &#x00a3;714 million in 2008/09, of which &#x00a3;249 million was from research grants and contracts.</p>
<p>UCL has over 4,000 academic and research staff and 648 <a>professor</a>s, the highest number of any British university. There are currently 36 <a>Fellows of the Royal Society</a>, 26 <a>Fellows of the British Academy</a>, 10 <a>Fellows of the Royal Academy of Engineering</a> and 78 <a>Fellows of the Academy of Medical Sciences</a> amongst UCL academic and research staff. 4th in the world (and 2nd in Europe) in the 2010 <a>QS World University Rankings</a> and 22nd in the world (and 5th in Europe) in the 2010 <a>Times Higher Education World University Rankings</a>.</p>
<p>UCL is a member of the <a>Association of Commonwealth Universities</a>, the <a>European University Association</a>, the <a>League of European Research Universities</a>, the <a>Russell Group</a>, <a>UNICA</a> and <a>Universities UK</a>. It forms part of the <a>'Golden Triangle'</a> of British universities and is a constituent of the <a>'G5'</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p></p>
<h3>19th century</h3>
<p>[[Image:The London University by Thomas Hosmer Shepherd 1827-28.JPG|right|thumb|<em>The London University</em> as drawn by [[Thomas Hosmer Shepherd]] and published in 1827/28 (now the <a>UCL Main Building</a>)]] [[Image:Jeremy Bentham Auto-Icon.jpg|right|thumb|[[Jeremy Bentham]]'s <a>auto-icon</a> is on public display in the cloisters of the UCL Main Building.]]</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>UCL was founded in 1826 under the name &quot;<strong>London University</strong>&quot; as a <a>secular</a> alternative to the religious universities of <a>Oxford</a> and <a>Cambridge</a>. It is sometimes described as the &quot;third oldest university in England&quot;, although <a>King's College London</a> and <a>Durham University</a> also claim this title &#x2013; <em>see: <a>Third oldest university in England debate</a></em>. Although the philosopher <a>Jeremy Bentham</a> is commonly seen as the father of UCL, he personally took no part in its creation. Bentham's radical ideas on education and society were the inspiration to the institution's founders however, particularly the Scotsmen <a>James Mill</a> (1773&#x2013;1836) and <a>Henry Brougham</a> (1778&#x2013;1868). In 1827 the Chair of Political Economy at London University was created, establishing the first Department of Economics in England. In 1828 the teaching of Classics and medicine began and the university became the first in England to offer English as a degree subject. </p>
<p>In 1830 London University founded the London University School, which was to later become <a>University College School</a>. In 1833 the university appointed Captain Alexander Maconochie, Secretary to the Royal Geographical Society, as the first professor of geography in the UK. In 1834 <a>University College Hospital</a> opened as a teaching hospital for the university medical school. In 1836, London University became formally known as &quot;<strong>University College, London</strong>&quot; (the comma between the words College and London was commonly used until recently), when, under a <a>Royal Charter</a>, it worked with the recently established King's College, London, to create the federal <a>University of London</a>. The <a>Slade School of Fine Art</a> was founded in 1871 as the result of a bequest from Felix Slade. In 1878 UCL became the first British university to admit women on equal terms to men. In 1898 William Ramsay discovered the elements <a>krypton</a>, <a>neon</a> and <a>xenon</a> whilst professor of chemistry at UCL.</p>
<h3>20th century</h3>
<p>Sir Gregory Foster became UCL&#x2019;s first <a>Provost</a> in 1906, a post that he held for the next 23 years. In the same year the Cruciform Building was opened as the new home for <a>University College Hospital</a>. In 1907 the University of London was formally reconstituted with a new Royal charter, and a number of new institutions joined the federation. As part of this reorganisation each of the constituent institutions, including UCL, lost their legal independece, and henceforth all offered degrees awarded by the University of London. UCL sustained considerable bomb damage during the <a>Second World War</a>, including to the Great Hall and the Carey Foster Physics Laboratory. The first UCL student magazine, <a>Pi Magazine</a>, was published for the first time on 21 February 1946. The <a>Institute of Jewish Studies</a> relocated to UCL in 1959. The <a>Mullard Space Science Laboratory</a> was established in 1966. In 1973 UCL became the first international link to the ARPANET, the precursor of the internet, sending the world's first e-mail in the same year. </p>
<p>In 1977 a new charter restored UCL's legal independence, although not &#x2013; at that time &#x2013; the power to award its own degrees. In 1986 UCL merged with the <a>Institute of Archaeology</a>. In 1988 UCL merged with the Institute of Laryngology &amp; Otology, the Institute of Orthopaedics, the Institute of Urology &amp; Nephrology and Middlesex Hospital Medical School. In 1994 the <a>University College London Hospitals NHS Trust</a> was established. UCL merged with the College of Speech Sciences and the <a>Institute of Ophthalmology</a> in 1995, the School of Podiatry in 1996 and the <a>Institute of Neurology</a> in 1997. In 1998 UCL merged with the Royal Free Hospital Medical School to create the Royal Free and University College Medical School (renamed the <a>UCL Medical School</a> in October 2008). In 1999 UCL merged with the <a>School of Slavonic and East European Studies</a> and the <a>Eastman Dental Institute</a>.</p>
<h3>21st century</h3>
<p>The <a>Jill Dando Institute of Crime Science</a>, the first university department in the world devoted specifically to reducing crime, was founded in 2001. The <a>London Centre for Nanotechnology</a> was established in 2003 as a joint venture between UCL and <a>Imperial College London</a>. In 2005 UCL was again granted its own taught and research degree awarding powers and all new UCL students registered from 2007/08 qualified with UCL degrees rather than University of London degrees. The majority of continuing students who were enrolled on taught-degree programmes before the academic year 2007/08 were given the choice of whether to receive a UCL degree or a University of London degree. Also in 2005 a major new 76,000 m&#x00b2; building was opened for University College Hospital on <a>Euston Road</a>, and the <a>UCL Ear Institute</a> was opened on <a>Gray's Inn Road</a> adjacent to the <a>Royal National Throat Nose and Ear Hospital</a>. </p>
<p>UCL merged with the <a>Institute of Child Health</a> in 2006, which became the largest division of the newly-formed <a>Faculty of Biomedical Sciences</a>. In 2007 the UCL Cancer Institute was opened in the newly-constructed Paul O'Gorman Building. In August 2008 UCL formed <a>UCL Partners</a>, the largest <a>academic health science centre</a> in Europe, with <a>Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust</a>, <a>Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust</a>, <a>Royal Free Hampstead NHS Trust</a> and <a>University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust</a>. In 2008 UCL became the first UK university to sign agreements for a campus in Australia, establishing the UCL School of Energy &amp; Resources, Australia in Adelaide.</p>
<p>As part of the <a>protests against the UK Government's plans to increase student fees</a>, around 200 students occupied the Jeremy Bentham Room and part of the <a>Slade School of Fine Art</a> for over two weeks during November and December 2010. The university successfully obtained a court order to evict the students but stated that it did not intend to enforce the order if possible. </p>
<p>Elsewhere in Central London are the <a>UCL Institute of Ophthalmology</a> (based in <a>Clerkenwell</a>), the Windeyer Institute (based in <a>Fitzrovia</a>), the UCL Institute of Orthopedics and Musculoskeletal Science (based in <a>Stanmore</a>), <a>The Royal Free Hospital</a> and the <a>Whittington Hospital</a> campuses of the UCL Medical School, and a number of other teaching hospitals. The <a>Department of Space and Climate Physics (Mullard Space Science Laboratory)</a> is based in <a>Holmbury St Mary</a>, <a>Surrey</a> and the UCL School of Energy and Resources is based in <a>Adelaide</a>, <a>Australia</a>. Since September 2010 UCL has been running a University Preparatory Certificate course in maths and physics at Nazarbayev University in <a>Astana</a>, <a>Kazakhstan</a>.</p>
<p>A number of important institutions are based near to the main Bloomsbury campus, including the <a>British Library</a>, the <a>British Medical Association</a>, the <a>British Museum</a>, <a>Cancer Research UK</a>, the <a>Institute for Fiscal Studies</a>, the <a>Medical Research Council</a>, <a>RADA</a>, the <a>Royal Academy of Art</a> and the <a>Wellcome Trust</a>. Many University of London schools and institutes are also close by, including <a>Birkbeck, University of London</a>, the <a>Institute of Education</a>, <a>London Business School</a>, the <a>London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine</a>, the <a>Royal Veterinary College</a>, the <a>School of Advanced Study</a>, the <a>School of Oriental and African Studies</a>, <a>The School of Pharmacy</a> and the <a>Senate House Library</a>. The nearest <a>London Underground</a> station is <a>Euston Square</a>, with <a>Goodge Street</a>, <a>Russell Square</a> and <a>Warren Street</a> all nearby. The mainline railway stations at <a>Euston</a>, <a>King's Cross</a> and <a>St Pancras</a> are all within walking distance.</p>

<h2>Organisation and administration</h2>
<p><a>right|300px|thumb|26 Bedford Way (home to the UCL Language Centre and parts of the Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, and Geography Department)</a></p>
<p>Although UCL voluntarily remains a constituent college of the University of London, it is in most ways comparable with free-standing, self-governing and independently funded universities, and it awards its own degrees.</p>
<p>The current Provost and President of UCL is <a>Professor Malcolm Grant</a>.</p>
<h3>Faculties and departments</h3>
<p> UCL&#x2019;s research and teaching is organised within a network of faculties and academic departments. Faculties and academic departments are formally established by the UCL Council, the governing body of UCL, on the advice of the Academic Board, which is UCL&#x2019;s senior academic authority.</p>
<p>UCL currently has the following eight constituent faculties:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>UCL Faculty of Arts and Humanities</a></li>
  <li><a>UCL Faculty of Biomedical Sciences</a></li>
  <li><a>UCL Faculty of the Built Environment (The Bartlett)</a></li>
  <li><a>UCL Faculty of Engineering Sciences</a></li>
  <li><a>UCL Faculty of Laws</a></li>
  <li><a>UCL Faculty of Life Sciences</a></li>
  <li><a>UCL Faculty of Mathematical and Physical Sciences</a></li>
  <li><a>UCL Faculty of Social and Historical Sciences</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The <a>UCL School of Slavonic and East European Studies</a> exists as an academic unit outside of the faculty structure.</p>
<p>In order to facilitate greater interdisciplinary interaction in research and teaching, UCL has also established three strategic faculty groupings: </p>
<ul>
  <li>UCL School of Life and Medical Sciences (comprising the UCL Faculty of Biomedical Sciences and the UCL Faculty of Life Sciences and incorporating the <a>UCL Medical School</a>)</li>
  <li>UCL School of the Built Environment, Engineering and Mathematical and Physical Sciences (comprising the UCL Faculty of the Built Environment, UCL Faculty of Engineering Sciences and UCL Faculty of Mathematical &amp; Physical Sciences)</li>
  <li>UCL Faculty of Arts &amp; Humanities, UCL Faculty of Laws, UCL Faculty of Social &amp; Historical Sciences and the UCL School of Slavonic &amp; East European Studies.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Finances</h3>
<p>In 2008/09 UCL had a net income of &#x00a3;713.7 million (2007/08 - &#x00a3;635.4 million) and total expenditure of &#x00a3;701.8 million (2007/08 - &#x00a3;634.7 million). UCL does have a coat of arms however, which depicts a raised bent arm dressed in armour holding a green upturned open wreath.</p>
<p>The <a>blazon</a> of these arms is:</p>
<p><em>Purpure, on a wreath of the colours Argent and Blue Celeste, an arm in armour embowed Argent holding an upturned wreath of laurel Vert, beneath which two branches of laurel Or crossed at the nombril and bound with a bowed cord Or, beneath the nombril a motto of Blue Celeste upon which Cuncti adsint meritaeque expectant praemia palmae</em></p>
<p>UCL's traditional sporting and academic colours of purple and light blue are derived from the arms.</p>
<h3>G5 lobby</h3>
<p>Within the United Kingdom UCL has been identified as part of a group of universities which has started to act as a self-conscious lobby and pressure group, commonly known as the G5. According to <em><a>Times Higher Education</a></em>, the five institutions are <a>Imperial College London</a>, the <a>LSE</a>, the <a>University of Cambridge</a>, the <a>University of Oxford</a>, and UCL, and it describes them as the super-elite (since all five are already members of the elite <a>Russell Group</a>).</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>UCL Faculty of Arts and Humanities</a> - 180  </li>
  <li><a>UCL Faculty of Biomedical Sciences</a> - 1,971  </li>
  <li><a>UCL Faculty of the Built Environment (The Bartlett)</a> - 136  </li>
  <li><a>UCL Faculty of Engineering Sciences</a> - 391  </li>
  <li><a>UCL Faculty of Laws</a> - 62  </li>
  <li><a>UCL Faculty of Life Sciences</a> - 591  </li>
  <li><a>UCL Faculty of Mathematical and Physical Sciences</a> - 445  </li>
  <li><a>UCL Faculty of Social and Historical Sciences</a> - 292  </li>
</ul>
<p>UCL has the highest number of <a>professor</a>s of any university in the UK, with 648 established and personal chairs.</li>
</ul>
<p>UCL has placed cross-disciplinary research as a priority and is orientating its research around four &quot;<a>Grand Challenges</a>&quot;. Professor David Price, Pro-Provost for Research explains: &quot;We believe we have a moral obligation to make a difference to global problems, and to combine the knowledge that our research generates to develop wisdom that can be applied in each of the four Grand Challenges: Global Health, Sustainable Cities, Intercultural Interaction and Human Wellbeing.&quot;</p>
<p>In the <a>Times Higher Education ranking of research council awards 2008-9</a> UCL is shown to have won the most research awards with 174 awards amounting to &#x00a3;81,365,000. In second place Cambridge won 162 awards amounting to &#x00a3;74,263,000. In third place Oxford won 153 awards amounting to &#x00a3;54,750,000. This is thought to be the first time that a university other than Cambridge or Oxford has headed the table.</p>
<p>UCL has also been very successful in securing research funding under the <a>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council's</a> (EPSRC) prestigious centres for doctoral training (CDTs). The aim of these centres is to &quot;provide a supportive and exciting environment for students to carry out a challenging PhD-level research project together with taught coursework&quot;. UCL has won funding for 9 of these centres, the next highest allocation was 4 centres awarded to the University of Bath. The centres awarded to UCL are worth &#x00a3;40 million, which will fund 390 PhD places. </p>
<p>UCL's 9 CDTs are <a>Energy Demand Reduction and the Built Environment</a> (UCL Energy Institute and Loughborough University), <a>Financial Computing</a> (UCL Computer Science), <a>Security Science</a> (UCL Centre for Crime and Security Science), <a>Photonic Systems Development</a> (UCL Electronic and Electrical Engineering in partnership with Cambridge University), <a>Virtual Environments, Imaging and Visualisation</a> (UCL Computer Science and UCL Bartlett School), <a>Molecular Modelling and Materials Science</a> (UCL Chemistry), <a>Urban Sustainability &amp; Resilience</a> (UCL Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering and UCL Bartlett School), <a>Bioprocess Engineering Leadership</a> (UCL Biochemical Engineering) and <a>CoMPLEX</a> (UCL Life Sciences). </p>
<p>There are currently approximately 3,000 PhD students working at UCL. The University provides information for prospective PhD students on its <a>Graduate web pages.</a></p>
<h3>Medicine</h3>
<p> [[Image:Finsbury moorfields eye hospital 1.jpg|right|thumb|[[Moorfields Eye Hospital]]]]</p>
<p>UCL has offered courses in medicine since 1834 but the current <a>UCL Medical School</a> developed from mergers with the medical schools of the <a>Middlesex Hospital</a> (founded in 1746) and <a>The Royal Free Hospital</a> (founded as the <a>London School of Medicine for Women</a> in 1874). Clinical medicine is primarily taught at The Royal Free Hospital, <a>University College Hospital</a> and the <a>Whittington Hospital</a>, with other associated teaching hospitals including the <a>Eastman Dental Hospital</a>, <a>Great Ormond Street Hospital</a>, <a>Moorfields Eye Hospital</a>, the <a>National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery</a> and the <a>Royal National Throat, Nose and Ear Hospital</a>.</p>
<p>UCL is a major centre for biomedical research. It is a member of three of the twelve biomedical research centres established by the <a>NHS</a> in England - the <a>UCLH/UCL Comprehensive Biomedical Research Centre</a>, the Moorfields Eye Hospital/UCL Institute of Ophthalmology Biomedical Research Centre and the Great Ormond Street Hospital/UCL Institute of Child Health Biomedical Research Centre. It is also a founding member of <a>UCL Partners</a>, the largest <a>academic health science centre</a> in Europe with a turnover of approximately &#x00a3;2 billion. It will be one of the world&#x2019;s largest medical research centres, housing 1,250 scientists.</p>
<h3>Admissions</h3>
<p>Admission to UCL is highly selective. Many of UCL's courses require 3 <a>A grades</a> at <a>A Level</a>, or a grade equivalent of 6,6,6 on higher level subjects on the <a>International Baccalaureate Program</a>. </p>
<p>Due to a very high proportion of applicants receiving the highest school grades, UCL, along with <a>Imperial College London</a> and the <a>University of Cambridge</a> was one of the first universities in the UK to make use of the A* grade at A-Level (introduced in 2010) for admissions, particularly for very oversubscribed courses such as Economics, Mathematics, History, Psychology, and European Social and Political Studies.</p>
<h3>Rankings</h3>
<p>In the 2010 <a>Academic Ranking of World Universities</a>, UCL is ranked 21st overall in the world (and 3rd in Europe), and 20th in the world (and 4th in Europe) for Life &amp; Agricultural Sciences. </p>
<p>In the 2010 <a>QS World University Rankings</a>, UCL is ranked 4th overall in the world (and 2nd in <a>Europe</a>). 15th in the world (and 4th in Europe) for Life Sciences and Medicine, and 25th in the world (and 5th in Europe) for Social Sciences. </p>
<p>In the 2010 <a>Times Higher Education World University Rankings</a>, UCL is ranked 22nd overall in the world (and 5th in Europe), 9th in the world (and 4th in Europe) for Clinical, Pre-Clinical and Health, 14th in the world (and 4th in Europe) for Social Sciences, and 10th in the world (and 3rd in Europe) for Arts and Humanities.</p>
<p>UCL is consistently one of the top multi-faculty universities in <a>UK university rankings</a>. UCL is ranked first in the UK for its staff/student ratio in <em>The Times Good University Guide</em>, <em>The Sunday Times University Guide</em> and <em>The Guardian University Guide</em>.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Libraries</h3>
<p>The UCL library system comprises 16 libraries located across several sites within the main UCL campus and across <a>Bloomsbury</a>, linked together by a central networking catalogue and request system called eUCLid. The libraries contain a total of over 1.5 million books. The largest library is the UCL Main Library, which is located in the <a>UCL Main Building</a> and contains collections relating to the arts and humanities, economics, history, law and public policy. These libraries contain over 3.7 million books and focus on the arts, humanities and social sciences. The intention is that material curated by UCL Eprints will remain accessible indefinitely. It includes collections of <a>medieval</a> manuscripts and early printed books, as well as significant holdings of 18th-century works, and highly important 19th- and 20th-century collections of personal papers, archival material, and literature, covering a vast range of subject areas. Archives include the Latin American archives, the <a>Jewish</a> collections and the <a>George Orwell</a> Archive. Collections are often displayed in a series of glass cabinets in the Cloisters of the <a>UCL Main Building</a>.</p>
<p>The most significant works are housed in the Strong Rooms. The special collection includes first editions of <a>Isaac Newton</a>'s <em><a>Principia</a></em>, <a>Charles Darwin</a>'s <a>On the Origin of Species</a> and <a>James Joyce</a>'s <a>Ulysses</a> . The earliest book in the collection is <em>The crafte to lyve well and to dye well</em>, printed in 1505.</p>
<p>[[Image:Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology.jpg|thumb|right|The current main building of the Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology which is expected to move into the [[UCL Institute for Cultural Heritage|Panopticon building]] upon its completion]] UCL is responsible for several museums and collections in a wide range of fields across the arts and sciences:</p>

<h3>Rivalry with King's College London</h3>
<p>:<em> Main Article <a>Student Rags</a></em></p>
<p>UCL has a long-running, mostly friendly, rivalry with <a>King's College London</a> (King's), which has historically been known as &quot;Rags&quot;. UCL is often referred to by students from King's as the &quot;Godless Scum of Gower Street&quot;, in reference to a comment made at the founding of King's, which was based on Christian principles. UCL students refer to King's as &quot;Strand Polytechnic&quot; in a similar attitude. </p>
<p>King's' mascot, <a>Reggie the Lion</a>, went missing in the 1990s and was recovered after being found dumped in a field. It was restored at the cost of around &#x00a3;15,000 and then placed on display in the students' union. It is in a glass case and filled with concrete to prevent theft, particularly by UCL students who once castrated it. In turn, King's' students are also believed to have once stolen Phineas, a UCL mascot. It is often claimed that King's' students played football with the embalmed head of <a>Jeremy Bentham</a>. Although the head was indeed stolen, the football story is a myth or legend which is unsupported by official UCL documentation about Bentham available next to his display case (his Auto Icon) in the UCL cloisters. The head is now kept in the UCL vaults.</p>
