<h2>History</h2>
<p> Established in 1934 to provide high quality education at a minimal cost, Lee College has continued that tradition for over 70 years.  Originally housed on the Robert E. Lee High School campus, Lee College severed its initial integration with the Goose Creek Independent School District under the leadership of the college's first dean, Walter Rundell.  In 1948, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools granted Lee College accreditation and recommended that the college develop its own campus apart from the local high school.  A successful bond election in the following year allowed for the construction of Rundell Hall and the campus gymnasium.  The college experienced tremendous growth after classes began in the new buildings in 1951.</p>
<p>By 1965, the college had added the Social Sciences building, the Library, Moler Hall, TV1 and Bonner Hall as well as an addition the gymnasium. Funding from the 1988 bond issue allowed for the construction of a new science building to replace the antiquated facilities formerly housed in the math and administration building. The renovation of the McNulty-Haddick building created additional classroom space for Allied Health and Fine Arts.</p>
<p>In 2000, another successful bond election led to expansion of the campus by more than 33% with the addition in 2002 of a new Advanced Technology Center. Parking was also expanded and beautification efforts including a central courtyard, covered walks, and landscaping were completed.</p>
<p>In 2003, Technical Vocational Building 1 received major renovations, including the construction of a Cisco Academy. <a>thumb|right|A rendering of the Lee College Performing Arts Center, set to open in Spring 2009</a> In October 2004, the College completed the renovation to the old library into a Student Center with game room, Cyber Caf&#x00e9;, Bayer Conference Center, Enterprise Gallery, Security office, and student club offices.  In December 2004, the College finished renovation to the Old Gym, which now provides offices, swimming pool, weight room and other facilities.</p>
<p>In 2008, Lee College began construction of its showcase Performing Arts Center which will host a variety of campus and community events. It is slated to open in the Spring of 2009 and cost approximately $14 million.</p>
