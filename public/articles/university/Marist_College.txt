<p> <strong>Marist College</strong> is a private <a>liberal arts college</a> on the east bank of the <a>Hudson River</a> near <a>Poughkeepsie</a>, <a>New York</a>, on. The site was established in 1905 by <a>Marist Brothers</a>, and the college was chartered in 1946. In 2003, Marist considered itself no longer a <a>Catholic</a> college, yet still maintaining a chapel on campus.</p>
<p>The college has 43 bachelors and masters degree programs and 20 certificates across the traditional undergraduate, graduate, adult education, and distance learning environments including online.</p>
<p>Approximately 4,000 undergraduate students attend the Poughkeepsie campus (). Marist College study sites also exist in 26 countries abroad including <a>Egypt</a>, <a>China</a>, <a>England</a>, <a>Italy</a> and <a>Australia</a>. In 2006, Marist opened a branch campus in <a>Florence</a>, <a>Italy</a> by partnering with the <a>Lorenzo de' Medici School</a>. In 2009, the school was bequeathed a mansion that has estimated value of $65 million in <a>Esopus</a>, <a>New York</a>, that will be used as a leadership institute.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Foundation as a training institution for Marist Brothers</h3>
<p>The <a>Marist Brothers</a> are a <a>Catholic</a> founded in <a>France</a> by <a>Saint Marcellin Champagnat</a> in 1816,  focused on educational work throughout the world. In 1905, members of the order arrived in the Mid-<a>Hudson Valley</a> to establish the first Marist house of studies in the <a>United States</a>. On the east bank of the <a>Hudson River</a>, just north of Poughkeepsie, they purchased property and a house from Thomas McPherson. They named the building and property &quot;Saint Ann's Hermitage&quot;, and began training young men for a life of &quot;study, work, prayer and service&quot; (from which the school motto is derived).</p>
<p>In 1908, the Brothers purchased more land to expand the Hermitage, and soon the land grew to .</p>
<p>The Marist College Library was originally housed on the top floor of Greystone in 1928. In 1945, reference, periodical and work areas took over the second floor as well, and then in 1949, the library also claimed Greystone's lowest level. The library remained in Greystone for 35 years.</p>
<p>By 1929, the training center at the Hermitage had evolved into the <a>Marist Normal Training School</a>, offering college-level courses. The charter for the Marist Normal Training School was obtained by Brother Leo Brouilette.  In 1946, the State of New York granted the institution an official four-year college charter under the name &quot;Marian College&quot;, led by Brother Paul Ambrose Fontaine, FMS. Marian College continued the mission of training Marist Brothers as teachers of the congregation's schools.</p>
<p>From 1947 to 1957, the Brothers began building on the weekends, their summers, and in their spare time a <a>gymnasium</a> (the original Marian Hall), Our Lady Seat of Wisdom Chapel, Adrian Hall (which was demolished in 2000), and a residence for the student Brothers (the original Fontaine Hall).</p>
<h3>Expansion in 1950s</h3>
<p>In 1958, Marist Brother Linus Richard Foy took charge of the college. At 28, he was the youngest college president in the United States. Two years later, Marian College became Marist College and the mission of the college broadened to include the wider community; <a>lay</a> male students were admitted to pursue degree study. An evening division was also introduced to serve the educational needs of the surrounding communities.</p>
<p>Sheahan Hall, the first residence hall, opened in 1962. It was named for Monsignor J. F. Sheahan (pastor of St. Peter's Church, Poughkeepsie) without whom the Marist Brothers might not have been able to purchase the Bech Estate that now comprises the entire south campus area. It was quickly followed by Leo Hall in 1963 and Champagnat Hall in 1965. They were named for Brother Leo Brouiletter (Provincial of the Marist Brothers, 1921&#x2013;1930) and Saint Marcellin Champagnat respectively.  Donnelly Hall (named for Brother Nilus Donnelly, who supervised construction of the 12 major campus facilities built by the Brothers), a dormitory at the time, was built in 1962 by the brothers themselves. </p>
<h3>1960s</h3>
<p>Women were admitted to the evening division classes in 1966, then to the day classes in 1968.  Marist's president, Brother Linus Foy, resigned from the Marist Brothers around this time but continued serving as president. Benoit House and Gregory House were erected in 1968 as a residence for the Marist Brothers living on campus.  Benoit House honored the memory of Brother Francis Xavier Benoit who taught at Marist for nineteen years, while serving also as Director of Construction for the Marist Brothers. Gregory House was named in memory of Brother Joseph Gregory Marchessault who was chairman of the Physics Department at Marist at the time of his death in 1969. Benoit and Gregory Houses became African American and Free University centers, respectively, during the sixties and seventies. They functioned as residences before being removed to make way for the Hancock Technology Center in 2009.</p>
<p>In 1969, due to the institution's rapid expansion and laws regulating federal aid to religiously affiliated educational institutions in New York State, ownership of the college was transferred to the Marist College Educational Corporation with an independent, predominantly lay board of trustees.</p>
<h3>1970s</h3>
<p>In the 1970s, programs for the educationally disadvantaged were expanded, a computer center was added, graduate programs in <a>business administration</a> and <a>community psychology</a> were instituted, and the James J. McCann Recreation Center was completed.</p>
<p>In 1973, President Foy began a cooperative program with area secondary schools, in which selected high school seniors take freshman courses and &quot;bridge&quot; into college. In fall 1974, the college expanded its commitment to continuing education by increasing course offerings in the evening division and summer session and in 1984, opened an off-campus extension center in <a>Fishkill</a>. (A second extension center was opened in the <a>Orange County</a> town of <a>Goshen</a> in fall 1993.)</p>
<p>The burgeoning library moved from Greystone to Donnelly Hall in 1963. In the space now occupied by the Computer Center and DN256, Donnelly Hall housed what was known as the Spellman Library for the next 12 years. The library moved from Donnelly to Fontaine Hall in 1975. It remained there until 1998, when the library moved temporarily across Route 9 to the former Poughkeepsie Steel Plant, purchased by Marist College to house the library while the new James A. Cannavino Library was constructed.</p>
<p>On February 18, 1975, freshman Shelley Sperling was shot and killed in the dining hall by her ex-boyfriend.</p>
<h3>1980s</h3>
<p>In 1979 Dr. <a>Dennis J. Murray</a> became president. During Murray's tenure as president, enrollment doubled, the campus grew to , every building on campus was either renovated or newly constructed, and numerous strategic partnerships were formed.</p>
<p><a>thumb|200px|Lowell Thomas Communications Center</a> One of the first strategic partnerships was formed with <a>IBM</a>, a major employer in the Mid-Hudson Valley. In 1984, Marist received $2.5 million in equipment and almost $2 million in software from the IBM Corporation to expand academic and administrative uses of computers on campus. </p>
<p>The Foy Townhouses, named after Dr. Linus Richard Foy, were built in 1982. Marian Hall was built in 1983 within and around the college's first gymnasium. It incorporates the first building to be constructed through the manual labor of the Brothers (1947). Because it is located adjacent to the spot where the Marian building (the college's principal classroom building) once stood, it carries on the name of that building as well as the original of the four year college.</p>
<p>To expand student housing, Gartland Commons was built on the north end of the campus in 1985. It is a townhouse community, housing approximately 300 students.</p>
<p>In 1987, the <a>Lowell Thomas</a> Communications Center opened, providing space for <a>communications</a>, <a>math</a>, and <a>computer science</a> studies. The building was built over the site of an outdoor swimming pool from the early days of Marist that was fed by a natural spring. </p>
<h3>1990s</h3>
<p><a>thumb|200px|left|Dyson Center</a> In 1990, the <a>Margaret M and Charles H Dyson</a> Center opened, providing a home for the School of Management, School of Social and Behavioral Sciences, and School of Graduate and Continuing Education.</p>
<p>Construction continued in 1994 with a $27 million Student Center, bookstore, dining facilities, art gallery, and a new adjoining dormitory (Midrise Hall). In 1996, Talmadge Court was purchased by the college as an official student residence.  In 1998, across neighboring <a>Route 9</a>, the Lower West Cedar townhouses were built.</p>
<p>Fontaine Hall, an academic and office building was constructed on the north end, followed by The James A. Cannavino Library right in the center of the main campus. Built with a concentrated focus on technology, the library is considered by campus planners to be the jewel and the heart of campus. The Library is named for James A. Cannavino, a long-time member of the Marist Board of Trustees. <a>thumb|200px|James A. Cannavino Library</a></p>
<h3>2000s</h3>
<p>With student enrollment increasing and a lack of housing for upperclassmen, the school purchased additional land across <a>Route 9</a> for expansion. Upper West Cedar, built in 2000, was constructed in a similar style to the Lower West Cedar Townhouses. The Upper Fulton Townhouses followed in 2004 and then the Lower Fulton Townhouses in 2008. These housing areas are connected by a central walkway that leads to the main campus. Also, the Upper Fulton Townhouses were featured on <em><a>Good Morning America</a></em>  in 2007 for a report on how some colleges and universities were buildings nicer dormitories to attract more students.</p>
<p>The housing expansion was a sore point with the Poughkeepsie residents, who blamed the college for excessive traffic on the Route 9 corridor. The <a>New York State Department of Transportation</a> and Marist College both blame massively increasing population in the Mid-Hudson Valley, a result of the migration of the residents of nearby <a>New York City</a> starting in late 2001. In May 2007, Marist was granted a variance allowing them to build despite a moratorium on new construction in the area.</p>
<p>In 2003, Marist invited New York State Attorney General <a>Eliot Spitzer</a> to deliver the commencement address for the graduating class, incurring protests aimed at the college for Spitzer's public support of <a>abortion</a>. Having received complaints, <a>Cardinal Archbishop of New York</a> <a>Edward Egan</a> declared Marist &quot;is no longer a Catholic institution&quot; and therefore not under the Church's jurisdiction. Although Marist had become independent in 1969 and it &quot;does not identify itself as a Catholic college in any way&quot;, For the next three years, housing is not guaranteed but enough housing consists to hold a large portion of the upperclassmen population. Townhouses make up all of the housing available for upperclassmen, mostly built within the last fifteen years. Additionally, the Upper Fulton townhouses were featured on <a>Good Morning America</a> for a story on how some colleges and universities are constructing nicer student housing to attract more students. All underclassmen live on the west side of <a>Route 9</a>, which is the main part of campus. Upperclassmen reside on the east side of <a>Route 9</a>, which is also considered the &#x2018;wet side&#x2019; of campus because the consumption of alcohol is allowed because all students are over the age of 21. The two sections of campus will be connected by an <a>underpass</a> in 2011. While all incoming freshman are automatically assigned to a dorm, sophomores and above partake in a points system to choose housing.  The priority points system, as it is known, dictates that students must accumulate a certain amount of points from clubs, sports, and GPA and are then ranked. The students with the highest points are allowed to choose housing first, thus filling the nicer housing first. The students with the lower points choose last, and are not always guaranteed housing. If students are entering as a group, then the student&#x2019;s points are averaged together. According to <a>Marist</a>, this system promotes student activity in clubs and sports and offers an incentive to keep a high GPA.</p>
<h3>Present day</h3>
<p>The College enrolls 4200 full-time traditional undergraduates, 750 part-time undergraduates and 850 graduate students. The College offers 32 bachelor degree programs, 11 master&#x2019;s degrees, 20 certificate programs and online degrees. </p>
<p>During the fall 2005 semester, approximately one third of the total classes (just over 500) utilized Ucompass Educator. Of those 500 courses between 30 and 35 (5-6%) were offered fully online.</p>
<p>Although the college is no longer religiously affiliated, religion continues as a field of study and a part of many students' and administrators' lives; as does the continued presence of several Marist Brothers who reside and work on campus.</p>
<p>In 2006, <a>Forbes</a> and <a>The Princeton Review</a> named Marist among the 25 &quot;most connected campuses&quot; in the United States. The August 2006 edition of Campus Technology magazine named Marist a &quot;Campus Technology Innovator&quot; for the college's &quot;iDentity Quest&quot; podcasting program, which provides iPods to students to record reflections on life in other countries and to share this information with classmates and professors.</p>
<p><a>thumb|left|200px|Fontaine Hall</a></p>
<p>The East Campus Tennis Pavilion opened in 2006 and features eight lighted, regulation-sized courts, a center walkway, and a pergola-covered spectator area. Marist joins the United State Military Academy and the United States Tennis Center in Queens, New York, host site of the U.S. Open, as the only tennis venues in the area that can boast a Deco II playing surface.</p>
<p>The college's Longview Park was completed in 2007 with a bike/walk path along the Hudson's shore, a fishing pier, the renovation of the historic Cornell boathouse, and better access to scenic vistas, particularly from the gazebo built on a promontory in the center of the park.</p>
<p>A new <a>grandstand</a> has been erected on the main athletic field, <a>Leonidoff Field</a>, and was officially opened on October 6, 2007.  It is officially referred to as Tenney Stadium. Tenney Stadium features a new grandstand with a large media facility and reception area, concession stand, rest rooms and team rooms, plus state-of-the-art field turf, a new scoreboard, and amphitheater-style seating on the west side of the field for lawn chairs and blankets.  There was quite a stir regarding the removal of approximately 20 trees in preparation for this project. The oldest of the trees was determined post-mortem to be 180 years old and was therefore in existence 80 years before the college came to be. Actually, it began life around the time of the founder of the Marist Brothers, <a>Saint Marcellin Champagnat</a>.  The fuss died down to a dull roar after an e-mail was sent around by the administration stating that the planting of 40 new trees was included in the project plans.</p>
<p>In September 2009, it was announced that Marist was bequeathed $75 million by the industrialist Raymond A. Rich. The donation consists of a  estate, known as the <a>Payne Mansion</a>, located in the <a>Ulster County</a> town of <a>Esopus</a> and is estimated to be worth $65 million. The rest of the money, approximately $10 million, is to be used to establish the Raymond A. Rich Institute. The 42,000 mansion was designed by <a>Carr&#x00e8;re and Hastings</a>, who also designed the <a>New York Public Library</a>. The school plans to use the house as part of the institute. The Raymond A. Rich Institute will focus on developing the communication, interpersonal, and social skills necessary to lead complex organizations in a global setting. The gift was the ninth largest donation in world in 2009.</p>
<h3>Future</h3>
<p><a>thumb|200px|Donnelly Hall</a> Marist has begun to construct a new technology building, the Hancock Center, which will be located on the main campus where the Benoit and Gregory (residence houses) used to stand. The  building is designed in a Gothic architectural style. It will comprise three computer labs, <a>Marist Institute for Public Opinion</a>, nine classrooms, six seminar rooms and a trading room for the business school. This project is expected to be finished in late 2010.</p>
<p>An <a>underpass</a> is planned to cross the <a>Route 9</a> corridor in 2011, in hopes of promoting safety and alleviating traffic congestion, popularly thought to be caused by students crossing at crosswalks. As Marist College does not have <a>jurisdiction</a> or authority over <a>Route 9</a>, this is a <a>New York State Department of Transportation</a> project. According to the <a>NYSDOT</a>, the <a>underpass</a> will be constructed during the summer of 2011 and be completed for the fall 2011-12 academic year. Following its completion, all three entrances of the college will be renovated and the main gate will be closed to vehicular traffic.</p>
<p>During the 2010-11 academic year, an  addition to the McCann Center gymnasium will be constructed. New offices and lockers for the men's and women's <a>basketball</a> teams will be constructed. New &quot;chair-back&quot; seating will replace the current bleachers in the field house.</p>
