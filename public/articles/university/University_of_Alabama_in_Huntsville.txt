<p><strong>The University of Alabama in Huntsville</strong> (also known as <strong>UAHuntsville</strong>) is a state-supported, <a>public</a>, <a>coeducation</a>al <a>university</a>, located in <a>Huntsville</a>, <a>Alabama</a>, <a>United States</a>, is accredited by the <a>Southern Association of Colleges and Schools</a> to award <a>baccalaureate</a>, <a>master's</a> and <a>doctoral</a> degrees, and is organized in five colleges: business, engineering, liberal arts, nursing and science.</p>
<p>UAH is one of three members of the <a>University of Alabama System</a>, which includes the <a>University of Alabama at Birmingham</a> and the <a>University of Alabama</a> in <a>Tuscaloosa</a>. All three institutions operate independently, with only the president of each university reporting to the Board of Trustees of the system. The university enrollment is approximately 7,500, and has a distributed ratio of 49:51, women to men. Incoming freshmen have an average score of 25 on the <a>ACT</a>, which is one of the best among Alabama's public universities.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p><a>thumb|250px|left|The Shelby Center for Science and Technology (in October 2008) which hosts several departments of the College of Science.</a> The genesis for a publicly funded institution of higher education in <a>Huntsville</a> was many years in the making. Begun in January 1950 as an extension of the <a>University of Alabama</a> and known as the University of Alabama Huntsville Center, classes were first taught at West Huntsville <a>High School</a>. UAH's first <a>undergraduate</a> degrees were awarded in May 1968 as part of the spring commencement ceremony at The University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, (although a &quot;cap and gown&quot; ceremony was held in Huntsville).</p>
<p>One year later, the University of Alabama System Board of Trustees voted to make UAH an independent and autonomous campus. Dr. Benjamin Graves, a graduate of the <a>University of Mississippi</a> in 1942, who was president of <a>Millsaps College</a> in <a>Jackson, Mississippi</a> was tapped as UAH's first president in 1970. He returned to faculty status in 1979 and retired in 1989.The first degree awarded for work completed entirely on the UAH campus was awarded to Julian Palmore in 1964. Mr. Palmore was at the time a <a>United States Navy</a> <a>ensign</a> assigned to <a>NASA</a>'s Research Projects Division. The first official on-campus graduation ceremony at UAH was in June 1970. The first woman to earn a <a>Ph.D.</a> from UAH was Virginia Kobler in 1979, in <a>Industrial Engineering</a>.</p>
<p>UAH's second president, Dr. John Wright was Vice <a>Chancellor</a> of the <a>West Virginia University</a> and began his service in 1979. Wright's term ended in 1988 and Dr. Louis Padulo became UAH's third president.</p>
<p>Huntsville leader Joseph Moquin took over the UAH presidency on an interim basis in 1990. Dr. Frank Franz, who was then <a>provost</a> at <a>West Virginia University</a>, was chosen as UAH's fourth president. His wife, Dr. Judy Franz, accompanied him and was granted full professorship in the physics faculty. Her renown in the scientific community was reaffirmed when she was named executive officer of the <a>American Physical Society</a> in 1994. At the beginning of the 2006-2007 academic year, Frank Franz announced his plan to step down as president after that year. [<a>http://www.uah.edu/News/newsread.php?newsID=334</a>]. On July 1, 2007, Dr. David B. Williams, formerly a professor of materials science and engineering and the vice <a>provost</a> for research at <a>Lehigh University</a>, began serving as UAH's fifth president.

<p>While UAH is known for engineering and science programs, including astrophysics, atmospheric science and aerospace engineering, Nursing remains the single largest major on campus. UAH scientists managed the first &quot;commercial,&quot; non-government rocket programs (Consort and Joust) in the U.S., the first <a>&quot;high-temperature&quot; superconductor</a> was discovered at UAH and the first U.S. experiment flown aboard the Soviet Mir space station was from UAH. UAH is a <a>Space Grant</a> university, and has a history of cooperation with <a>NASA</a> at the <a>Marshall Space Flight Center</a>, and the <a>U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command</a> at <a>Redstone Arsenal</a>. In conjunction with helping NASA reach its goals, UAH makes NASA's research and technology available to all of Alabama's colleges and universities. The <a>National Space Science and Technology Center</a> is on the UAH campus.</p>
<p>The UAH Propulsion Research Center ([PRC]) is a research center that promotes interdisciplinary research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students.  The PRC was founded by Dr. Clark W. Hawk in 1991 and has since provided support for NASA, the Department of Defense, and the Department of Energy.  Research topics explored include air breathing propulsion, solid, liquid &amp; hybrid propellent combustion, magnetoinertial fusion, electric propulsion, high temperature materials, and space and terrestrial power systems.  </p>
<p>Research in nanotechnology and microfabrication is administered by the <a>Nano and Micro Devices Center</a>.</p>
<p>At least eight departments or programs also hold accreditation from professional associations, including the <a>Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology</a>, the <a>American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business</a>, the <a>American Chemical Society</a>, the <a>Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education</a>, the <a>Computing Sciences Accreditation Board</a>, and the <a>National Association of Schools of Music</a>.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p></p>
<p>UAH is a member of the <a>National Collegiate Athletic Association</a> and fields 13 varsity teams at the <a>Division II</a> level and one (ice hockey) in <a>Division I</a>.  The UAH <a>Division I</a> mens ice hockey team was denied entry into the <a>CCHA</a> in 2009.</p>
<p>Its <a>ice hockey</a> team won the NCAA Division II national championship in 1996 and 1998 and now competes in <a>Division I</a> as a member of <a>College Hockey America</a>. UAH houses only NCAA ice hockey program south of the [[Mason-Dixon Line. In 2012, UAH will host the <a>NCAA</a> Hockey <a>Frozen Four</a> championship finals, which will play at the <a>St. Pete Times Forum</a> in <a>Tampa, Florida</a>. UAH was selected as host of the &quot;Frozen Four&quot;, as being the closest collegiate hockey program to Florida. In 2007, UAH won the College Hockey America Tournament in a win over <a>Robert Morris University</a>. The victory granted them an automatic bid to the NCAA Division I Tournament as the 16th seed. They were pitted against first seed <a>Notre Dame</a>, losing 3-2 in a double overtime heartbreaker; it was one of the longest games in NCAA Tournament history. On March 13, 2010, UAH defeated Niagara 3-2 in overtime to claim its second CHA Conference Championship and an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament.</p>
<p><a>Basketball</a> and hockey games are regularly scheduled as part of alumni returning for <a>homecoming</a>, and carpets are rolled out on the rink between periods for the homecoming court walk.</p>
<p>UAH also sponsors <a>soccer</a> (men's and women's), women's <a>volleyball</a>, <a>cross country</a> (men's and women's), <a>basketball</a> (men's and women's), <a>tennis</a> (men's and women's), men's <a>baseball</a> and women's <a>softball</a> at the <a>Division II</a> level as a member of the <a>Gulf South Conference</a>.  UAH competes in <a>track and field</a> (men's and women's) as an independent member of Division II. Although this is a new part to UAH, it has become one of the most competitive UAH sports.</p>
<p>UAH's men's cross country team won its first Gulf South Conference championship in 2007 and qualified to the NCAA Division II National Championship in 2007 and 2008.  The women's team won conference titles in 1999, 2003 and 2004 and made its last appearance at the national championships in 2007.</p>
<h3>Pep band</h3>
<p>UAH also has an athletic <a>pep band</a>.  The pep band has claimed to have the <a>World's Longest Cheer</a>. The leader of the cheer instructs the crowd to &quot;Gimme a T!&quot; (to which the crowd replies &quot;T!&quot;), &quot;Gimme an H!&quot; (to which the crowd replies &quot;H!&quot;), and so on until &quot;The University of Alabama in Huntsville&quot; has been spelled (with the crowd even instructed to &quot;Gimme a space!&quot;).  After this, the cheer continues with &quot;Now say it like a marketing major! UAHuntsville&quot; and is concluded with &quot;Now say it like an engineer! UAH!&quot; (with UAH! repeated several times).  In hockey games, it is common for this cheer to be interrupted by a goal, and in such an event, the pep band will resume where it left off after playing the fight song.</p>

<p>The UAH Student Government Association is the primary recipient of student activity funding.  With the exceptions of ACE and the campus newspaper <em>The Exponent</em>, all student organizations must be chartered with the SGA.  The SGA hosts a number of events including Frosh Mosh, an annual event that welcomes incoming freshman the weekend they arrive on campus.  Events have included a hypnotist, live music, and the highly anticipated foam party.  The SGA also charters two buses to allow approximately 80 UAH students to make an annual trip to <a>Niagara, New York</a> to cheer for the UAH Ice Hockey team as they compete against <a>Niagara University</a>.</p>
<h3>Residence halls</h3>
<p>UAH has five residence halls:  Central Campus Residence Hall (CCRH), Frank Franz Hall, North Campus Residence Hall, Southeast Campus Housing, and Charger Village. CCRH is reserved for first-time freshman students.  Frank Fanz Hall is reserved for first time students as well as Honor Program students whereas upper class students have option of living at the other residence halls.</p>
<p>Campus Housing originated with the construction of South East Housing. These suites were originally built by the late Dr. Benjamin Graves, the first President of UAH, with the assistance of the late Alabama Senator <a>John Sparkman</a>.</p>
<h3>Greek life</h3>
<p>UAH is home to the following fraternities and sororities.  Each Greek organization rents a fraternity or sorority house from the University.  Each of these houses were built in 2006.  The construction of these houses were made possible thanks to the generous benefactors Mark and Linda Smith and Jim and Susie Hudson.</p>

<h3>Student Success Center</h3>
<p>The Student Success Center (SSC) (formerly known as the Academic Resource Center (ARC)) offers tutoring for nearly all freshman and sophomore level courses offered at UAH.  Additional tutoring is available for math courses online and in person.</p>
<p>The SSC recruits university students for its PASS (Peer Assisted Study Sessions) program, in which students sit in on courses that they have already succeeded in, and offer class-specific study sessions outside of class, usually 3 hours per week.  Historically difficult freshman courses are targeted for PASS, including Calculus, Chemistry and Economics.</p>
<p>Recently, the SSC has absorbed the Cooperative Education program.</p>
<h3>Cooperative education</h3>
<p>UAH offers numerous cooperative education opportunities for its students, many of which lead to post-graduation employment.</p>
