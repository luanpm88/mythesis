<p><strong>Carleton College</strong> is an independent <a>non-sectarian</a>, <a>coeducation</a>al, <a>liberal arts college</a> in <a>Northfield</a>, <a>Minnesota</a>, <a>USA</a>. The college currently enrolls 1,958 undergraduate students, and employs 198 full-time faculty members. <a>Steven G. Poskanzer</a> is the current President. In 2010 <em><a>U.S. News and World Report</a></em> ranked Carleton College the 8th best liberal arts college in the United States and in 2011 US News ranked Carleton number one for undergraduate teaching at a national liberal arts college.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The school was founded on May 3, 1866, by the Minnesota Conference of <a>Congregational Church</a>es as <strong>Northfield College</strong>. Two local businessmen, <a>Charles Augustus Wheaton</a> and <a>Charles M. Goodsell</a>, each donated  of land for the first campus.  The first students enrolled in fall 1867. In 1870, the first college president, <a>James Strong</a>, traveled to the East Coast to raise funds for the college. On his way from visiting <a>William Carleton</a> of <a>Charlestown, Massachusetts</a>, Strong was badly injured by a train. Impressed by Strong's survival, Carleton donated US$50,000 to the fledgling institution in 1871, and the Board of Trustees renamed the school in his honor.</p>
<p>The college graduated its first class in 1874. The first two graduates, James J. Dow and Myra A. Brown, married each other later that year.</p>
<p>On September 7, 1876, the <a>James-Younger Gang</a>, led by outlaw <a>Jesse James</a>, attempted to rob the  First National Bank of Northfield. <a>Joseph Lee Heywood</a>, Carleton's Treasurer, was acting cashier at the bank that day.  He was shot and killed for refusing to open the safe. Carleton later named a library fund after Heywood, and the Heywood Society is the name for a group of donors who have named Carleton in their wills.</p>
<p>In its early years under the presidency of James Strong, Carleton reflected the theological conservatism of its Minnesota Congregational founders. In 1903, modernist religious influences were brought when <a>Yale Divinity School</a> graduate William Sallmon was hired as college president. Sallmon was opposed by conservative faculty members, who forced him out by 1908.</p>
<p>The trustees hired another theologically liberal Yale Divinity School graduate, Donald J. Cowling, as his successor. In 1916, under Cowling's leadership, Carleton began an official affiliation with the Minnesota <a>Baptist</a> Convention.  It lasted until 1928, when the Baptists severed the relationship as a result of <a>fundamentalist</a> opposition to Carleton's liberalism, including the college's support for teaching about <a>evolution</a>.</p>
<p>In 1927, students founded what is the nation's oldest student-run pub, <a>The Cave</a>. Located in the basement of <a>Evans Hall</a>, it continues to host live music shows and other events several times each week.</p>
<p>In 1942, Carleton purchased land in <a>Stanton</a>, about  east of campus, to use for flight training. During <a>World War II</a>, several classes of male students went through air basic training at the college. The Stanton Airfield is operated for commercial use, having been sold by the college in 1944.</p>
<p>The world premiere production of <a>Bertolt Brecht</a>'s play <em><a>The Caucasian Chalk Circle</a></em> was performed in 1948 at Carleton's Nourse Little Theater.</p>
<p>The <a>Reformed Druids of North America</a> was founded at Carleton in 1963, initially as an effort by students to be excused from attending the then-required weekly chapel service.  Later the group conducted legitimate spiritual exploration.  Meetings continue to be held in the <a>Carleton College Cowling Arboretum</a>.  </p>
<p>The popular early computer game <em><a>The Oregon Trail</a></em> was created, and later further developed, by students at Carleton in 1971.</p>
<p>President <a>Bill Clinton</a> gave the last commencement address of his administration at Carleton, on June 10, 2000.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>Carleton College is accredited by the <a>North Central Association of Colleges and Schools</a>. The next on-site review for this accreditation will be in 2018-19.</p>
<h3>Rankings</h3>
<p>Academically, Carleton has been nationally recognized as a leading undergraduate institution.  It is consistently ranked in the <em><a>U.S. News and World Report's</a></em> college rankings as one of the top ten U.S. liberal arts schools. According to 2008 <em><a>U.S. News and World Report</a></em> rankings, Carleton College is the #8 liberal arts college in the United States.</p>
<p>In the <a>Forbes Magazine</a> ranking of American colleges, which combines liberal arts colleges and national research universities together in one list, the College is ranked #21. Among liberal arts colleges only, Carleton ranks #10 in the survey.</p>
<p>Carleton College is part of the <a>Annapolis Group</a>, which has made a group statement asking members not to participate in ranking surveys. President Robert Oden stated on September 7, 2007, &quot;We commit not to mention U.S. News or similar rankings in any of our new publications, since such lists mislead the public into thinking that the complexities of American higher education can be reduced to one number.&quot;</p>
<p>Carleton participates in the <a>National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities</a> (NAICU)'s <a>University and College Accountability Network</a> (U-CAN), a co-operative effort on the part of colleges to provide data for school comparison on a variety of bases.</p>
<h3>Admissions and selectivity</h3>
<p>On average, the middle 50 percent of first-year students received 1330-1490 on the <a>SAT</a> Critical Reading and Math Sections and a composite 29-33 on the <a>ACT</a>; more than three quarters of the entering students ranked in the top 10% of their high school graduating classes.</p>
<p>Carleton has enrolled more students who are in the <a>National Merit Scholarship Program</a> than any other liberal arts college in the country. Its Class of 2012 includes 93 National Merit Scholars (which includes both Carleton-sponsored and external National Merit Scholars) among its 493 students.</p>
<h3>Graduates</h3>
<p>Among American liberal arts institutions, Carleton College is a leading source of undergraduate students pursuing doctorates. It has also been recognized for sending a large number of female students to graduate programs in the sciences.</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<h3>Extracurricular organizations</h3>
<p><a>thumb|left|250px|Carleton College Glee Club, 1913</a> The school's nearly 150 active student organizations include three theatre boards (coordinating as many as ten productions every term), longform and shortform improv groups and a sketch comedy troupe, seven <em><a>a cappella</a></em> groups, four choirs, seven specialized instrumental ensembles, five dance interest groups, two auditioned dance companies, a successful Mock Trial team, a nationally competitive debate program, seven recurring student publications, and a student-run <a>KRLX</a> radio station, which employs more than 200 volunteers each term.</p>
<p>In 5 of the last 12 years, Carleton College students received the Best Delegation award at the World Model United Nations competition.</p>
<p>The College's format-free student-run radio station, <a>KRLX</a>, founded in 1947 as KARL, was recently ranked by the <em><a>Princeton Review</a></em> as one of the nation's &quot;Ten Best College Radio Stations&quot;. KRLX broadcasts continually when school is in session.</p>
<p>&quot;Lenny Dee&quot; is Carleton's original sketch comedy group. Modeling themselves after <em><a>Saturday Night Live</a></em> and other such shows, Lenny Dee (often affectionately abbreviated to simply &quot;Dee&quot;) brings a regular comedy variety show to campus once a term.</p>
<p>In 2009 two Carleton students founded the first and only comics magazine at Carleton, the Carleton Comics Journal (now known as the Carleton Graphic).  It releases an issue once every two weeks and has been generally well-received by the Carleton community.</p>
<p>The school has several <a>a cappella</a> groups. The oldest is the all-male Carleton Singing Knights, which has toured and recorded extensively over its more than 50-year history.  The Knights performed a version of Daft Punk's &quot;<a>Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger</a>&quot;. Their video on <a>Youtube</a> has received over 4 million views. It was this cover that prompted a student to make a video for the song, titled <em><a>Daft Hands</a></em>. The video became an internet sensation - it has been viewed over 31 million times on Youtube and resulted in the student's appearance on <em><a>The Ellen DeGeneres Show</a></em> for a reprise performance.</p>
<p>The Knightingales, one of the all-female groups, are the second-oldest <em>a capella</em> group on campus.  They performed on a special radio performance hosted by <a>Garrison Keillor</a> at Dacie Moses House in 2002.</p>
<h3>Traditions</h3>
<p>Carleton has numerous student traditions. These include painting the college's water tower.  Most notably, a likeness of <a>President Clinton</a> was painted on the tower the night before his commencement speech in 2000.  Early the following morning, college maintenance quickly painted over it. The administration's view of this particular phenomenon have changed over time. For liability-related reasons, climbing the water tower is now considered a grave infraction.  <a>Streaking</a> is a ubiquitous phenomenon, most impressive when conducted during winter temperatures that average about 15 &#x00b0;F (-9 &#x00b0;C), and occasionally reach lows around -40&#x00b0; (-40 &#x00b0;C).</p>
<p><a>thumb|right|President Emeritus Laurence Gould is briefly reunited with the bust of Schiller in this undated archive photo from <em>The Carletonian</em></a> A bust of <a>Friedrich Schiller</a>, known simply as  &quot;Schiller&quot;, has made regular appearances, though briefly, at large campus events. The tradition dates back to 1957, when a student took the bust from an unlocked storage area in the Gould Library, only to have it taken from him in turn. Possession of the bust escalated into an elaborate competition, which took on a high degree of secrecy and strategy.</p>
<p>These days Schiller's appearance, accompanied by the shout &quot;Schiller!&quot;, is a tacit challenge to other students to try to capture the bust.  The currently circulating bust of Schiller was retrieved from <a>Puebla</a>, <a>Mexico</a> in the summer of 2003. In 2006, students created an online scavenger hunt, made up of a series of complex riddles about Carleton, which led participants to Schiller's hidden location. The bust was stolen from the winner of the scavenger hunt. At commencement in 2006, the holders of the bust arranged for Schiller to &quot;graduate.&quot;  When his name was called at the appropriate moment, the bust was pulled from behind the podium and prominently displayed.</p>
<p>In March 2010, the bust of Schiller appeared on The Colbert Report . The appearance was organized by custodians of Schiller who contacted Peter Gwinn, a writer for the program and an alumnus of Carleton.  </p>
<p>The bust also appeared on a Halloween broadcast of &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot; on Minnesota Public Radio. </p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p><a>thumb|left|300PX|Gould Library</a> The college campus was created in 1867 with the gifts of two  parcels from local businessmen Charles Goodsell and <a>Charles Augustus Wheaton</a>. The campus sits on a hill overlooking the <a>Cannon River</a>, at the northeast edge of Northfield. To the north and east are athletic fields and the <a>Cowling Arboretum</a>.  These were farm fields in the early years of the college. Open land beyond the Arboretum is still largely devoted to agriculture.</p>
<p>The center of campus is an open field called &quot;the Bald Spot,&quot; which is used for <a>ultimate frisbee</a> in the warmer months and flooded for skating and <a>broomball</a> in the winter. Most of the campus buildings built before <a>World War II</a> surround the Bald Spot (the exceptions are Goodsell Observatory and Margaret Evans Hall).</p>
<h3>Campus buildings</h3>
<p>Several of Carleton's older buildings have been listed on the <a>National Register of Historic Places</a> (NRHP). These include <a>Willis Hall</a>, the first building on campus, which was constructed beginning in 1869 and completed in 1872. Originally it contained the men's dormitory, classrooms, library, and chapel. The building was gutted by fire in 1879, after which it was entirely rebuilt within the existing stone shell. The original front of the building became the rear entrance with the construction of Severance Hall in 1928. As new buildings were built, academic departments shifted in and out of the building. Beginning in 1954, it was the college student union, until it was replaced in 1979 by the Sayles-Hill Student Center. It now houses the Economics, Political Science, and Educational Studies offices. The college's clock bell tower and the main college flagpole, along with the radio tower for KRLX, sit on the roof.</p>
<p><a>Goodsell Observatory</a>, also on the NRHP, was constructed in 1887 and at the time was the largest observatory in the state of Minnesota. It was named for Charles Goodsell, who donated land for the campus. Goodsell Obeservatory replaced the college's original one, built in 1877.  It was razed in 1905 to make room for Laird Hall. From the late 19th century to the end of the World War II, Goodsell Observatory kept the time for every major <a>railroad</a> west of the <a>Mississippi River</a>, including <a>Northern Pacific Railway</a>, the <a>Great Northern Railway</a>, the <a>Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Paul Railroad</a>, and the St. Paul, Minneapolis, and Manitoba railroads. Goodsell served as the headquarters of a state weather service from 1883 to 1886.</p>
<p>Scoville Hall (originally <a>Scoville Memorial Library</a>), completed in 1896, is on the NRHP.  It was later replaced as the college library by the Gould Library. It now houses the cinema and media studies department, the media center, and the academic support center.</p>
<p>Four nineteenth-century buildings were demolished: Gridley Hall was for many years the main women's dormitory. It was built in 1882 and demolished in 1967 to make way for the Music and Drama Center.  Williams Hall stood in front of Leighton Hall and was the college's first science building, built in 1880 and demolished in 1961. Seccombe House was located near the site of the current Skinner Chapel, and was used for music instruction from 1880 to 1914. The original Observatory was built 1878, was replaced as college observatory in 1887, and was demolished in 1905 to make way for Laird Hall</p>
<p>[[Image:Carleton chapel.JPG|thumb|[[Skinner Memorial Chapel]].]] <a>Skinner Memorial Chapel</a>, completed in 1916, is on the NRHP. Carleton built a new  Recreation Center in 2000.  A full indoor fieldhouse is located above a fitness center, which includes a <a>climbing wall</a> and bouldering wall.</p>
<h3>Cowling Arboretum</h3>
<p> The Cowling Arboretum, &quot;the Arb&quot;, was initially created from lands purchased in the 1920s by President Donald J. Cowling. As the college was having difficult financial times, it was first called &quot;Cowling's Folly&quot; but later became his legacy. After Carleton Farm was closed, its acreage was added to the Arboretum.</p>
<p>Since 1970 acreage has been removed from cultivation in sections. It consists of approximately 880 acres (3.6&nbsp;km&#x00b2;) of restored and remnant forest, Cannon River <a>floodplain</a>, bur oak (<em>Quercus macrocarpa</em>) <a>savannah</a>, and <a>tallgrass prairie</a>. The Arboretum is divided by Minnesota Highway 19 into the larger Lower Arb to the north (so called because it includes the Cannon River valley) and the smaller Upper Arb. There are pedestrian trails throughout the Arb, including the school's cross-country running and skiing courses, and a paved mixed-use bicycle/running trail in the Upper Arb.</p>
<h3>Sustainability</h3>
<p>Carleton is committed to environmentally conscious initiatives.  In October 2007, the Sustainable Endowments Institute, a <a>Cambridge, Massachusetts</a> organization, recognized Carleton as a leader in overall college sustainability. In the &quot;College Sustainability Report Card 2008&quot;, which evaluates the 200 colleges and universities with the largest endowments in the United States and Canada, Carleton received the highest evaluation grade of A-, putting the college in the category of College Sustainability Leader with <a>Dartmouth College</a>, <a>Harvard University</a>, <a>Brown University</a>, <a>Middlebury College</a>, <a>University of Vermont</a> and <a>University of Washington</a>. The Report Card also cited Carleton as an Endowment Sustainability Leader, along with Dartmouth College and <a>Williams College</a>. Carleton receives approximately 40% of its energy from a <a>wind turbine</a> located near the college.</p>
<h2>Athletics</h2>
<p>&lt;!---all sports should be named. Not sure this stuff should all be in here. Conference titles aren't usually mentioned---&gt; Carleton has athletic opportunities for students, including 19 <a>varsity team</a>s, 23 club teams, and dozens of <a>intramural</a> teams (including 40 separate <a>broomball</a> teams) forming every term. Carleton competes in <a>NCAA Division III</a>, meaning it offers no <a>athletic scholarship</a>s.</p>
<p>Its men's and women's <a>cross country</a> teams has produced a number of all-Americans and one national championship (Fellahs', 1980).</p>
<p>The Men and Women's Swimming and Diving program participates in the <a>Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference</a> (MIAC) conference.</p>
<p>The football team won the conference championship in 1992 with a 9-1 record and received one of 16 bids to the Division III National Championship Tournament.</p>
<p>In 2006, the men's basketball team tied the University of St. Thomas for the conference championship and received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament.</p>
<p>In 2007, the women's golf program sent its first individual qualifier to the Division III Women's Golf NCAA Tournament.</p>
<p>In 2008, the men's soccer team won the conference championship, thereby receiving an automatic NCAA bid.  They reached the Sweet 16 of the tournament, marking one of the most successful seasons in Carleton history.</p>
<p>The women's soccer team won the MIAC Playoffs in 2008, receiving an automatic NCAA bid. They attained the Elite 8 of the tournament, marking the first time in Carleton sports history.</p>
<p>Carleton hosted the only <a>NCAA</a>-sponsored metric football game in 1977. The game was dubbed the &quot;Liter Bowl&quot; and was measured in meters instead of yards. Carleton lost the game to <a>St. Olaf</a> by a score of 43-0.  The event was the last to fill Carleton's Laird Stadium.</p>
<h3>Club sports</h3>
<p>The student-run <a>Ultimate</a> <a>frisbee</a> clubs have had the most competitive success; most notably, the school's top men's team, Carleton Ultimate Team (CUT), and women's team, Syzygy, are perennial national contenders in the <a>Ultimate Players Association</a> College Division. CUT has qualified annually for nationals from 1989 to 2010, and won the National Championship in 2001 and 2009. Syzygy has qualified for women's nationals all but one year since 1987, and won the National Championship in 2000. The second men's Ultimate team, the <a>Gods of Plastic (GOP)</a>, won the 2009 and 2010 Division III National Championship tournaments</p>
<p>The spring intramural softball league is known as Rotblatt, in honor of baseball player <a>Marvin Rotblatt</a>. Once a year a day-long game, also known as Rotblatt, lasts the same number of innings as the number of years since Carleton's founding.  In 1997, <em><a>Sports Illustrated</a></em> honored Rotblatt in its &quot;Best of Everything&quot; section with the award, &quot;Longest Intramural Event.&quot;</p>
<h2>In fiction and popular culture</h2>
