It is located about a half hour from the regional city of <a>Moncton</a> and 20 minutes from the <a>Greater Moncton International Airport</a>. With a combination of historical architecture and modern facilities as well as its well-kept grounds, the campus is among the most beautiful in Canada. It has been ranked first or second in the country for the last 20 years by <em><a>Maclean's</a></em> magazine (in the category of &quot;primarily undergraduate&quot; universities) and given top ratings in <em>Maclean's</em> annual alumni survey.</p>
<p>Mount Allison University was the first university in the <a>British Empire</a> to award a baccalaureate to a woman (<a>Grace Annie Lockhart</a>, B.Sc, 1875). Over the years, Mount Allison graduates have been awarded a total of 49 <a>Rhodes Scholarship</a>s, more than any other liberal arts university in North America. Mount Allison is the wealthiest university in Canada on an endowment per student basis. Mount Allison students and alumni are referred to as &quot;Allisonians&quot;.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Mount Allison University is a United Church-affiliated, non-sectarian university established at <a>Sackville, New Brunswick</a> in 1862. Its origins were steeped in the <a>Methodist</a> faith. It was designed to prepare men for the ministry and to supply education for lay members. The university's affiliation was transferred to the <a>United Church of Canada</a> following church union in 1925. Original components of the university included: the Mount Allison Wesleyan Academy for Boys (1840&#x2013;1958), the Ladies' College (1854&#x2013;1958), and Mount Allison College. Mount Allison College was established in 1862 with degree-granting powers on behalf of the other two. <a>thumb|220px|right|Springtime in Sackville - a view of Convocation Hall from the swan pond, Mount Allison University.</a>  [[Image:SackvilleFoundersMonument.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The Sackville founders monument commemorates [[Sackville, New Brunswick|Sackville]]'s incorporation and its founding peoples. It was installed on the campus of Mount Allison University in 2003.]] Mount Allison's origins go back to a boys' academy founded in June 1839 by a local <a>Methodist</a> merchant, Charles Frederick Allison. Charles Allison's grandfather had emigrated from <a>Ireland</a> to Canada in the late 18th century because of the after effects of a dinner with the local government tax collector. Wanting to impress the man, the family had set the table with their one valuable possession; silver spoons. After entertaining their guest, the Allisons were informed by the tax collector that if they could afford silver spoons, then they could certainly afford to pay more taxes. The Allisons left <a>Ireland</a> shortly thereafter. The offending spoons are now on display in the main university library.</p>
<p>In June 1839, Charles Allison proposed to the <a>Wesleyan Methodists</a> that a school of elementary and higher learning be built. He offered to purchase a site in Sackville, to erect a suitable building for an academy, and to contribute operating funds of &#x00a3;100 a year for 10 years. This offer was accepted and the Wesleyan Academy for boys subsequently opened in 1843.</p>
<p>In 1854, a girls' institution (later known as the &quot;Ladies College&quot;) was opened to complement the boys' academy.</p>
<p>In July 1862, the degree-granting Mount Allison College was organised. The first two students, Howard Sprague and <a>Josiah Wood</a>, graduated in May 1863. Mount Allison was the first university in the <a>British Empire</a> to confer a Bachelor's degree to a woman (<a>Grace Annie Lockhart</a>, B.Sc. 1875).  It was also the first university in Canada to grant a Bachelor of Arts to a woman    (Harriet Starr Stewart). For nearly a century, Mount Allison functioned as three distinct, mutually enriching parts: the College proper, the Boys' Academy and the Ladies College.</p>
<p>The governance was modelled on the provincial University of Toronto Act of 1906 which established a bicameral system of university government consisting of a senate (faculty), responsible for academic policy, and a board of governors (citizens) exercising exclusive control over financial policy and having formal authority in all other matters. The president, appointed by the board, was to provide a link between the 2 bodies and to perform institutional leadership. The Memorial Library, built in 1927 to commemorate the sacrifices of students in The Great War, was designed by renowned Atlantic architect Andrew Cobb.  It is one of the few historic buildings that remain on campus.  The current administration of Mount Allison is seeking its demolition to be replaced with a Fine and Performing Arts centre.  </p>
<p>The closure of the School for Girls in 1946 and the Boy's Academy in 1953 coincided with a period of expansion and provided much-needed space for the growing university. In 1958, a period of construction and acquisition of buildings began, easing the strain of overcrowding at the institution. At this time the university board and administration decided to reaffirm the traditional aims of Mount Allison in providing a high-quality undergraduate <a>liberal arts</a> education, along with continuing to offer professional programmes in already-established fields. As such, the university decided not to compete for new professional programs and generally avoided post-graduate course development.</p>
<p>The policy of university education initiated in the 1960s responded to population pressure and the belief that higher education was a key to social justice and economic productivity for individuals and for society. Mount Allison University was established by the Mount Allison University Act, 1993.</p>
<p>Mount Allison University<code>s Arms and Badge were registered with the <a>Canadian Heraldic Authority</a> on November 15, 2007.</code></p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>In December 2010, Mount Allison University was ranked the #1 university in Canada for the 15th time in the primarily undergraduate university category, as rated by <a>Maclean's</a> magazine. Mount Allison has also produced 49 <a>Rhodes Scholars</a>, the highest number per capita of any university in the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>The mission statement of Mount Allison University promotes &quot;the creation and dissemination of knowledge in a community of higher learning, centred on the undergraduate student and delivered in an intimate and harmonious environment&quot;. Mount Allison currently offers Bachelor's degrees in Arts, Science, Commerce, Fine Arts and Music, as well as Master's degrees in Biology and Chemistry and Certificates in Bilingualism. A Bachelor's degree in Aviation has recently been developed in conjunction with the <a>Moncton Flight College</a>.</p>
<p>The university has a controlled full time enrollment of about 2,250 students. The student body at Mount Allison comes from every province in Canada and there is a large proportion of international students as well.</p>

In addition, Mount Allison also offers students a chance to live in one of four satellite residences (Pavillon Bousquet, Bermuda, Carriage and Cuthebertson), which are smaller in size, ranging from eleven residents to 26.  Three of these offer specific themes, Bermuda as the international house (housing a mix of students from around the world), Carriage as the animal house (taking care of animals for the Moncton SPCA) and Cuthbertson as the environmentally-friendly house.</p>
