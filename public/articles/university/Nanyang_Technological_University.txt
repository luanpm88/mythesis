<p><strong>Nanyang Technological University</strong> (<a>Abbreviation</a>: <strong>NTU</strong>) is a research <a>public university</a> in <a>Singapore</a>. The university's main 200-hectare garden campus, known as the Yunnan Garden campus, is in the south-western part of the island. It houses Singapore's largest on-campus residence infrastructure including 16 halls of residence for undergraduates and a graduate hall. In 2010 <a>QS World University Rankings</a> ranked the university 74th overall in the world, having been ranked joint 73rd in the 2009 <a>THE-QS World University Rankings</a> (in 2010 <a>Times Higher Education World University Rankings</a> and <a>QS World University Rankings</a> parted ways to produce separate rankings). NTU was ranked 174th place (out of 200) in 2010 Times Higher Education World University Rankings. NTU was the Olympic Village for the first-ever Youth Olympic Games in 2010. It is a founding member of Global Alliance of Technological Universities.</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>

<p>The Yunnan Garden campus, with its lush landscape and undulating terrain, is located in south-western <a>Singapore</a>, some  from the city-centre. The original part of the campus was built in 1986 and the campus buildings are laid out on a master plan drawn up by architect <a>Kenzo Tange</a>.</p>
<p>Members of the university community study and work in laboratories, lecture theatres and tutorial rooms. The School of Art, Design and Media has grassy-sloped roofs mimicking the rolling hills of the garden campus. </p>
<p>The campus has an e-learning infrastructure on top of a wired and wireless network setup. Seminars and lectures are supported by facilities that allow multi-media presentations, video-conferencing and communication between lecture theatres and venues.</p>
<p>Staff and students can choose to live in quarters and residential halls within the NTU Campus, and have access to leisure and recreational facilities. Currently, there are 16 Hall of Residences for the students within the campus. Students are able to choose from single or double-sharing rooms, although there have been proposals of triple room sharing.</p>
<p>In late 2000, NTU's <a>National Institute of Education</a> shifted into its new $400 million campus at the NTU grounds.</p>
<h2>Colleges, schools and institutes</h2>
<p>NTU has four colleges, comprising 12 schools. The College of Engineering, with six schools focused on technology innovation, enjoys wide renown and ranks fourth in the world in engineering publications. &lt;!-- What's the source for this next piece of self-praise??? Whoever wrote it has to prove the boasts are correct!.........The College of Science is at the forefront of Singapore's life sciences and science initiatives, while the Nanyang Business School (College of Business) offers one of the world's top 25 MBA programmes.--&gt; The College of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences has Singapore's first professional art school, the Humanities and Social Science School, and the Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information. The school is named after the late Dr <a>Wee Kim Wee</a>, a former President of Singapore who was a <a>journalist</a> and diplomat.</p>

<h2>The Nanyang Chronicle</h2>
<p></p>
<p>The <em>Nanyang Chronicle</em> is the campus' largest print and web news outlet, with a print circulation of approximately 15,000. Serving primarily NTU staff and students, the Chronicle is distributed across the campus on newsstands and is published once every three weeks. It is run entirely by a team of student editors with guidance from teacher advisors from the Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information (WKWSCI).</p>
<p>It was first published in July 1994 with the aim of providing timely campus news and information, as well as being the voice of the campus population. The paper also provides practical training for undergraduates who are keen to work in the field of journalism after graduation.</p>
<p>As of 2010, the chief editor is Shereen Naaz Charles and the managing editor is Elizabeth Law.</p>
<h2>Internet learning on Campus</h2>
<p>The University is connected to the Internet. All the facilities and resources available over the Internet are accessible by anyone on the campus network. The campus network, which links together all computing systems on the campus, is managed by the University's Centre for IT Services (<a>CITS</a>).</p>
<p>To supplement the fixed-line campus network, NTU implemented a campus-wide wireless network in 2000. This high-speed wireless network, capable of a transfer rate of up to 11 megabits per second, enables NTU staff and students equipped with mobile devices such as notebooks, PCs and PDAs to access all networked services from practically anywhere on the campus without the need of a hardwired network connection.</p>
<p>NTU provides e-learning services via <a>edveNTUre</a>. edveNTUre, based on BlackBoard technology, provides the framework and eco-system for learning and teaching. Besides providing a repository of lecture recordings, lecture notes, it also facilitates learning activities for collaboration, discussion, assessment and project work. During term time, the usage typically by faculty and students exceeds nine-million page views weekly (Jan 2010).</p>
