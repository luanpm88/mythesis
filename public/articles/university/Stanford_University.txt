<p> The <strong>Leland Stanford Junior University</strong>, commonly referred to as <strong>Stanford University</strong> or <strong>Stanford</strong>, is a <a>private research university</a> located in <a>Stanford, California</a>, United States with a strong emphasis on scientific, technological and social science research. The university is located on an  campus in northwestern <a>Santa Clara Valley</a> approximately  northwest of <a>San Jose</a> and  southeast of <a>San Francisco</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;stanford_tours&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p><a>Leland Stanford</a>, a Californian railroad tycoon and politician, founded the university in 1891 in honor of his son, <a>Leland Stanford, Jr.</a> who died of <a>typhoid</a> at the age of 16. The university was established as a coeducational and nondenominational institution, but struggled financially after the senior Stanford's 1893 death and much of the campus was damaged by the <a>1906 San Francisco earthquake</a>. Following World War II, Provost <a>Frederick Terman</a> supported faculty and graduates' entrepreneurialism to build self-sufficient local industry in what would become known as <a>Silicon Valley</a>. By 1970, Stanford was home to a <a>linear accelerator</a>, one of the original four <a>ARPANET</a> nodes, and had transformed itself into a major research university in <a>computer science</a>, <a>mathematics</a>, <a>natural sciences</a>, and <a>social sciences</a>. More than 50 Stanford faculty, staff and alumni have won the <a>Nobel Prize</a> (<a>list of Nobel Laureates by university affiliation</a>). Stanford also boasts the largest number of <a>Turing award</a> winners for a single institution. Stanford faculty and alumni have founded many prominent technology companies, including <a>Cisco Systems</a>, <a>Electronic Arts</a>, <a>Google</a>, <a>Hewlett-Packard</a>, <a>LinkedIn</a>, <a>Sun Microsystems</a>, and <a>Yahoo!</a>.</p>
<p>The university is organized into seven schools including academic schools of <a>Humanities and Sciences</a> and <a>Earth Sciences</a> as well as professional schools of <a>Business</a>, <a>Education</a>, <a>Engineering</a>, <a>Law</a>, and <a>Medicine</a>. Stanford has a student body of approximately 6,900 undergraduate&lt;ref name=&quot;stanford_facts_2010&quot; /&gt; and 8,400 graduate students.&lt;ref name=&quot;stanford_facts_2010&quot; /&gt; Stanford is a founding member of the <a>Association of American Universities</a> and managed US$1.15 billion in research funding and $15.9 billion in endowment support in 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;endowment&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Stanford competes in 34 varsity sports and is one of two private universities in the <a>NCAA Division I-A</a> <a>Pacific-10 Conference</a>. The <a>University of California, Berkeley</a> (&quot;Cal&quot;) is Stanford's traditional rival, and the two football teams compete annually in the &quot;<a>Big Game</a>&quot;. Stanford's athletic program has won the <a>NACDA Directors' Cup</a> every year since 1995.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the <a>2008 Summer Olympics</a> in <a>Beijing</a>, Stanford athletes won 25 medals, including 8 gold medals, more than any other university in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Origins</h3>
<p>Stanford was founded by <a>Leland Stanford</a>, a <a>railroad</a> magnate, <a>United States Senator</a>, and former <a>California Governor</a>, and his wife, <a>Jane Stanford</a>. It is named in honor of their only child, <a>Leland Stanford, Jr.</a>, who died in 1884 just before his 16th birthday. His parents decided to dedicate a university to their only son, and Leland Stanford told his wife, &quot;The children of California shall be our children.&quot;</p>
<p>[[File:Leland Stanford p1070023.jpg|thumb|right|Leland Stanford, the university's founder, as painted by [[Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier]] in 1881 and now on display at the <a>Cantor center</a>]] Senator and Mrs. Stanford visited Harvard's President <a>Eliot</a> and asked how much it would cost to duplicate Harvard in <a>California</a>. Eliot replied that he supposed $15 million would be enough. However, the Stanfords were gracefully rebuffed in securing <a>A.D. White</a>, the president of <a>Cornell University</a>, as Stanford's founding president.&lt;ref&gt;There exists a <a>popular story</a> that a lady in &quot;faded gingham&quot; and a gentleman in a &quot;homespun threadbare suit&quot; went to visit the president of <a>Harvard</a> about making a donation, were rebuffed, and then founded Stanford. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, White recommended <a>David Starr Jordan</a>, White's former student and the president of <a>Indiana University</a>. He was their eventual choice to direct Stanford, although they had offered leaders of the Ivy League twice his salary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Starr&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Locals and members of the university community are known to refer to the school as <strong>The Farm</strong>, a nod to the fact that the university is located on the former site of Leland Stanford's horse farm.</p>
<p>The motto of Stanford University, selected by President Jordan, is &quot;<em>Die Luft der Freiheit weht.</em>&quot; Translated from the <a>German</a>, this quotation from <a>Ulrich von Hutten</a> means &quot;The wind of freedom blows.&quot;  The motto was controversial during World War I, when anything in German was suspect; at that time the university disavowed that this motto was official.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</pre>
<p>The university's founding Grant of Endowment from Leland and Jane Stanford was written on November 11, 1885, and accepted by the first Board of Trustees on November 14.&lt;ref&gt;<a>The Founding Grant</a> The Founding Grant with  Amendments, Legislation,  and Court Decrees&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;<a>The Leland Stanford, Junior, University.</a> The Act of the Legislature of California. The Grant of Endowment.  Address of Leland Stanford to the Trustees.  Minutes of the First Meeting of Board of Trustees.&lt;/ref&gt;  Besides defining the operational structure of the University, the Grant of Endowment made several specific stipulations: &quot;The Trustees ... shall have the power and it shall be their duty:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To establish and maintain at such University an educational system, which will, if followed, fit the graduate for some useful pursuit, and to this end to cause the pupils, as easily as may be, to declare the particular calling, which, in life, they may desire to pursue;  ...</li>
  <li>To prohibit sectarian instruction, but to have taught in the University the immortality of the soul, the existence of an all-wise and benevolent Creator, and that obedience to His laws is the highest duty of man.</li>
  <li>To have taught in the University the right and advantages of association and co-operation.</li>
  <li>To afford equal facilities and give equal advantages in the University to both sexes.</li>
  <li>To maintain on the Palo Alto estate a farm for instruction in agriculture in all its branches.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>The cornerstone was laid on May 14, 1887, and after six years of planning and building, the university officially opened on October 1, 1891, to 559 students and 15 faculty members, seven of them from Cornell.&lt;ref name=&quot;cornell&quot;&gt;<a>Cornell/Stanford Connection</a>&lt;/ref&gt; When the school opened, students were not charged for tuition, a program which lasted into the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Among the first class of students was a young future president <a>Herbert Hoover</a>, who would claim to be the first student <em>ever</em> at Stanford, by virtue of having been the first person in the first class to sleep in the dormitory.&lt;ref&gt;Dave Revsine, <a>One-sided numbers dominate Saturday's rivalry games</a>, ESPN.com, November 30, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The original 'inner quad' buildings (1887&#x2013;91) were designed by <a>Frederick Law Olmsted</a>, <a>Francis A. Walker</a>, <a>Charles Allerton Coolidge</a>, and Leland Stanford himself.</p>
<h4>Coeducation</h4>
<p>The school was established as a <a>coeducation</a>al institution. However, Jane Stanford soon put a policy in place limiting female enrollment to 500 students because of the large number of women students enrolling. She did not want the school to become &quot;the <a>Vassar</a> of the West&quot; because she felt that would not be an appropriate memorial for her son. In 1933 the policy was modified to specify an undergraduate male:female ratio of 3:1.&lt;ref&gt;<a>The Stanford Daily, November 12, 2004</a>&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;Stanford ratio&quot; of 3:1 remained in place until the early 1960s. By the late 1960s the &quot;ratio&quot; was about 2:1 for undergraduates, but much more skewed at the graduate level, except in the humanities. As of 2005, undergraduate enrollment is split nearly evenly between the sexes, but males outnumber females about 2:1 at the graduate level.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h4>Early finances</h4>
<p>When Senator Stanford died in 1893, the continued existence of the university was in jeopardy. A $15 million government lawsuit against Senator Stanford's estate, combined with the <a>Panic of 1893</a>, made it extremely difficult to meet expenses. Most of the Board of Trustees advised a temporary closing until finances could be sorted out. However, Jane Stanford insisted that the university remain in operation. Faced with the possibility of financial ruin for the University she took charge of financial, administrative, and development matters at the university 1893-1905; from her experience as a mother and housewife, she ran the institution as a household. For the next several years, she paid salaries out of her personal resources, even pawning her jewelry to keep the university going. When the lawsuit was finally dropped in 1895, a university holiday was declared.&lt;ref&gt;Edith R. Mirrielees, <em>Stanford: The Story of a University</em>, (1959), pp. 82-91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p><a>Edward Alsworth Ross</a> gained fame as a founding father of American sociology; in 1900 Jane Stanford fired him for radicalism and racism, unleashing a major academic freedom case.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Jane Stanford's actions were sometimes eccentric. In 1897, she directed the board of trustees &quot;that the students be taught that everyone born on earth has a soul germ, and that on its development depends much in life here and everything in Life Eternal&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Starr1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; She forbade students from sketching nude models in life-drawing class, banned automobiles from campus, and did not allow a hospital to be constructed so that people would not form an impression that Stanford was unhealthy. Between 1899 and 1905, she spent $3 million on a grand construction scheme building lavish memorials to the Stanford family, while university faculty and self-supporting students were living in poverty.&lt;ref name=&quot;Starr1&quot; /&gt;</p>
<h3>20th century</h3>
<p>[[Image:StanfordLibrary-1906.jpg|thumb|left|The ruins of Stanford Library after the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]]]] The <a>1906 San Francisco earthquake</a> destroyed parts of the Main Quad (including the original iteration of <a>Memorial Church</a>) as well as the gate that first marked the entrance of the school; rebuilding on a somewhat less grandiose scale began immediately.</p>
<h4>Football</h4>
<p>From 1906 to 1919, in response to the crisis caused by numerous injuries, intercollegiate football was in jeopardy. While some colleges dropped football entirely, a few, such as the University of California and Stanford University, replaced it with English rugby. From 1906 to 1914, the two schools played rugby as their major sport, but they soon found that the objectionable practices they saw in football were introduced into rugby. Finally, when the football rules were changed, a move developed to return to football, reviving intercollegiate sports and enabling students and alumni to identify with football, an American sport.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h4>Hoover Institution</h4>
<p>The <a>Hoover Institution</a> (full name: the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution, and Peace) at Stanford was set up by <a>Herbert C. Hoover</a>, one of Stanford's first graduates. He had been in charge of American relief efforts in Europe after World War I before his election as president of the United States in 1928. Hoover's express purpose was to collect the records of contemporary history as it was happening. Hoover's helpers frequently risked their lives to rescue documentary and rare printed material, especially from countries under Nazi or Communist rule. Their many successes included the papers of <a>Rosa Luxembourg</a>, the Goebbels diaries, and the records of the Russian secret police in Paris. Research institutes were also set up under Hoover's influence, though inevitably there were to be clashes between the moving force, Hoover, and the host university. In 1960, W. Glenn Campbell was appointed director and substantial budget increases soon led to corresponding increases in acquisitions and related research projects. Despite student unrest in the 1960s, the institution continued to thrive and develop closer relations with Stanford. In particular, the Chinese and Russian collections grew considerably. The Institute increasingly became a conservative think tank, with ties to Washington, especially since 1980.  It continues as an integral component of the University.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>Post 1945</h3>
<h4>Biology</h4>
<p>The biological sciences department evolved rapidly from 1946 to 1972 as its research focus changed, due to the Cold War and other historically significant conditions external to academia. Stanford science went through three phases of experimental direction during that time. In the early 1950s the department remained fixed in the classical independent and self-directed research mode, shunning interdisciplinary collaboration and excessive government funding. Between the 1950s and mid-1960s biological research shifted focus to the molecular level. Then, from the late 1960s onward, Stanford's goal became applying research and findings toward humanistic ends. Each phase was preempted by larger social issues, such as the escalation of the Cold War, the launch of Sputnik, and public concern over <a>medical abuses</a>.&lt;ref&gt;Eric J.; Vettel,  &quot;The Protean Nature of Stanford University's Biological Sciences, 1946-1972&quot;, <em>Historical Studies in the Physical &amp; Biological Sciences; 2004 35(1): 95-113&lt;/ref&gt;</em></p>
<h4>High tech</h4>
<p>A powerful sense of regional solidarity accompanied the rise of Silicon Valley. From the 1890s, the university's leaders saw its mission as service to the West and shaped the school accordingly. At the same time, the perceived exploitation of the West at the hands of eastern interests fueled booster-like attempts to build self-sufficient indigenous local industry. Thus, regionalism helped align Stanford's interests with those of the area's high-tech firms for the first fifty years of Silicon Valley's development. The distinctive regional ethos of the West during the first half of the 20th century is an ingredient of Silicon Valley's already prepared environment, an ingredient that would-be replicators ignore at their peril.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>During the 1940s and 1950s, <a>Frederick Terman</a>, as dean of engineering and provost,  encouraged faculty and graduates to start their own companies. He is credited with nurturing <a>Hewlett-Packard</a>, <a>Varian Associates</a>, and other high-tech firms, until what would become <a>Silicon Valley</a> grew up around the Stanford campus. Terman is often called &quot;the father of Silicon Valley.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;C. Stewart Gillmor, &quot;Fred Terman at Stanford: Building a Discipline, a University, and Silicon Valley&quot; (2004); <a>netvalley.com background</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h4>Physics</h4>
<p>In 1962-70 negotiations took place between the Cambridge Electron Accelerator Laboratory (shared by Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology), the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, and the US Atomic Energy Commission over the proposed 1970 construction of the Stanford Positron Electron Asymmetric Ring (SPEAR). It would be the first US electron-positron colliding beam storage ring. Paris (2001) explores the competition and cooperation between the two university laboratories and presents diagrams of the proposed facilities, charts detailing location factors, and the parameters of different project proposals between 1967 and 1970. Several rings were built in Europe during the five years that it took to obtain funding for the project, but the extensive project revisions resulted in a superior design that was quickly constructed and paved the way for Nobel Prizes in 1976 for <a>Burton Richter</a> and in 1995 for <a>Martin Perl</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; During 1955-85, solid state technology research and development at Stanford University followed three waves of industrial innovation made possible by support from private corporations, mainly Bell Telephone Laboratories, Shockley Semiconductor, Fairchild Semiconductor, and Xerox PARC. In 1969 the <a>Stanford Research Institute</a> operated one of the four original nodes that comprised <a>ARPANET</a>, predecessor to the <a>Internet</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h2>Campus</h2>
<p>[[Image:Stanford Campus Aerial Photo.JPG|300px|thumb|right|An [[aerial photography|aerial photograph]] of the Stanford University campus]] Stanford University is located on an &lt;ref name=&quot;stanford_tours&quot;/&gt; campus on the <a>San Francisco Peninsula</a>, in the northwest part of the <a>Santa Clara Valley</a> (<a>Silicon Valley</a>) approximately  southeast of <a>San Francisco</a> and approximately  northwest of <a>San Jose</a>. The main campus is adjacent to the city of <a>Palo Alto</a>, bounded by <a>El Camino Real</a>, Stanford Avenue, Junipero Serra Boulevard, and <a>Sand Hill Road</a>. The university also operates the <a>Hopkins Marine Station</a> in <a>Pacific Grove, California</a>, in <a>Monterey Bay</a>.</p>
<p>Stanford University owns , which makes it the second largest university in the world in terms of contiguous area. <a>Moscow State University</a> is built vertically and has a larger total floor area but occupies a smaller piece of land. <a>Berry College</a>, near <a>Rome, Georgia</a> occupies  of contiguous land, and <a>Paul Smith's College</a> occupies  of land in the <a>Adirondack Mountains</a> of upstate New York, but neither is a university. <a>Duke University</a> occupies , but they are not contiguous.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The <a>United States Air Force Academy</a> has a contiguous  at its disposal, but it is not a university. <a>Dartmouth College</a>, with a large <a>land grant</a>,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; owns more than , but only  of those are part of the campus.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; <a>Sewanee: The University of the South</a> occupies  in its &quot;Domain&quot;; however, most of this is unused forest.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1886, when the campus was first being planned, Stanford brought the president of <a>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>, <a>Francis Amasa Walker</a>, and prominent <a>Boston</a> landscape architect <a>Frederick Law Olmsted</a> westward for consultations. Olmsted worked out the general concept for the campus and its buildings, rejecting a hillside site in favor of the more practical flatlands. <a>Charles Allerton Coolidge</a> then developed this concept in the style of his late mentor, <a>Henry Hobson Richardson</a>, in the <a>Richardsonian Romanesque</a> style, characterized by rectangular stone buildings linked by arcades of half-circle arches. The original campus was also designed in the Spanish-colonial style common to California known as <a>Mission Revival</a>. The red tile roofs and solid <a>sandstone</a> masonry are distinctly Californian in appearance and famously complementary to the bright blue skies common to the region, and most of the subsequently erected buildings have maintained consistent exteriors.</p>
<p>Much of this first construction was destroyed by the <a>1906 San Francisco earthquake</a>, but the university retains the Quad, the old Chemistry Building (which is not in use and has been boarded up since the 1989 <a>Loma Prieta earthquake</a>),&lt;ref&gt;<a>Stanford centennial tour</a>&lt;/ref&gt; and Encina Hall (the residence of <a>Herbert Hoover</a>, <a>John Steinbeck</a>, and <a>Anthony Kennedy</a> during their times at Stanford). After the 1989 earthquake inflicted further damage, the university implemented a billion-dollar capital improvement plan to retrofit and renovate older buildings for new, up-to-date uses.</p>
<p>Stanford University is actually its own <a>census-designated place</a> within <a>unincorporated</a> <a>Santa Clara County</a>, although some of the university land (including the <a>Stanford Shopping Center</a> and the <a>Stanford Research Park</a>) is within the city limits of Palo Alto. The campus also includes some land in the city limits of <a>Menlo Park</a> (Stanford Hills neighborhood), and in adjacent unincorporated areas of <a>San Mateo County</a> (including the <a>SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory</a> and the <a>Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve</a>). Stanford shares much with the city of Palo Alto, including its <a>school district</a> and <a>fire department</a>, although the police forces are separate. The <a>United States Postal Service</a> has assigned Stanford two <a>ZIP codes</a>: 94305 for campus mail and 94309 for <a>P.O. box</a> mail. It lies within <a>area code 650</a> and campus phone numbers start with 721, 723, 724, 725, 736, 497, or 498.</p>

<h3>Landmarks</h3>
<p> Contemporary campus landmarks include the <a>Main Quad</a> and <a>Memorial Church</a>, the <a>Cantor Center for Visual Arts</a> and <a>art gallery</a>, the <a>Stanford Mausoleum</a> and the <a>Angel of Grief</a>, <a>Hoover Tower</a>, the <a>Rodin</a> sculpture garden, the <a>Papua New Guinea Sculpture Garden</a>, the <a>Arizona Cactus Garden</a>, the <a>Stanford University Arboretum</a>, <a>Green Library</a> and <a>the Dish</a>. <a>Frank Lloyd Wright</a>'s 1937 <a>Hanna-Honeycomb House</a> and the 1919 <a>Lou Henry and Herbert Hoover House</a> are both listed on the <a>National Historic Register</a>. &lt;gallery&gt; Image:Stanford University Quad Memorial Church.JPG|&lt;center&gt;<a>Stanford Memorial Church</a>&lt;/center&gt; Image:Lou Henry Hoover House from NW.jpg|&lt;center&gt;<a>Lou Henry and Herbert Hoover House</a>&lt;/center&gt; Image:Stanford University Hoover Tower.JPG|&lt;center&gt;<a>Hoover Tower</a>&lt;/center&gt; Image:The Dish, Stanford University.jpg|&lt;center&gt;<a>The Dish</a>&lt;/center&gt; &lt;/gallery&gt;</p>
<h3>Faculty residences</h3>
<p>One of the benefits of being a Stanford faculty member is the &quot;Faculty Ghetto&quot;, where faculty members can live within walking or biking distance of campus. The Faculty Ghetto is composed of land owned entirely by Stanford. Similar to a <a>condominium</a>, the houses can be bought and sold but the land under the houses is rented on a 99-year lease. Houses in the &quot;Ghetto&quot; appreciate and depreciate, but not as rapidly as overall <a>Silicon Valley</a> values. However, it remains an expensive area in which to own property, and the average price of single-family homes on campus is actually higher than in Palo Alto. Stanford itself enjoys the rapid capital gains of Silicon Valley landowners, although by the terms of its founding the university cannot sell the land.</p>
<h3>Non-main campus</h3>
<p>On the founding grant but away from the main campus, <a>Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve</a> is a nature reserve owned by the university and used by wildlife biologists for research. <a>Hopkins Marine Station</a>, located in <a>Pacific Grove, California</a>, is a <a>marine biology</a> research center owned by the university since 1892. The university also has its own golf course and a seasonal lake (<a>Lake Lagunita</a>, actually an irrigation reservoir), both home to the endangered <a>California Tiger Salamander</a>. <a>Lake Lagunita</a> is often dry now, but the university has no plans to artificially fill it.&lt;ref&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; </p>
<h3>Sustainability</h3>
<p>Stanford offers a free shuttle bus service named <a>Marguerite</a> and offers monetary incentives to its employees for carpooling. The university also has several sustainability initiatives underway. The  Green Dorm currently under consideration under the design supervision of  Professor <a>Gil Masters</a> will house between forty and fifty students, have a net carbon emission of zero, and produce more electricity than the building itself uses.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A new environmentally friendly Environment and Energy building is also planned. The Woods Institute also serves to undergird the university's environmental movement, as a &quot;hub for multidisciplinary environmental research, teaching, and outreach.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Stanford is a member of the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The <a>Aspen Institute</a> has ranked the <a>Stanford Graduate School of Business</a> as the number one MBA program for incorporating social and environmental issues into the training of future business leaders, out of 590 schools worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; And in 2009, the Sustainable Endowments Institute awarded Stanford University a grade of A- in its annual College Sustainability Report Card, making it one of the top fifteen of the 300 colleges and universities in the U.S. and Canada reviewed. (Climate, energy, and transportation were weak points.)&lt;ref name=&quot;greenreportcard.org&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h2>Administration and organization</h2>
<p>Stanford University is a tax-exempt <a>corporate trust</a> owned and governed by a privately appointed 35-member <a>Board of Trustees</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;FG facts&quot;/&gt; Trustees serve five-year terms (not more than two consecutive terms) and meet five times annually.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Stanford trustees also oversee the <a>Stanford Research Park</a>, the <a>Stanford Shopping Center</a>, the <a>Cantor Center for Visual Arts</a>, <a>Stanford University Medical Center</a>, and many associated medical facilities (including the <a>Lucile Packard Children's Hospital</a>).&lt;ref name=&quot;FG facts&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The Board appoints a President to serve as the chief executive officer of the university and prescribe the duties of professors and course of study, manage financial and business affairs, and appoint nine vice presidents.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; <a>John L. Hennessy</a> was appointed the 10th President of the University in October 2000.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Provost is the chief academic and budget officer, to whom the deans of each of the seven schools report.&lt;ref name=&quot;Provost&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; <a>John Etchemendy</a> was named the 12th Provost in September 2000.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The university is organized into seven schools: <a>School of Humanities and Sciences</a>, <a>School of Engineering</a>, <a>School of Earth Sciences</a>, <a>School of Education</a>, <a>Graduate School of Business</a>, <a>Stanford Law School</a> and the <a>Stanford University School of Medicine</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;Provost&quot;/&gt; The powers and authority of the faculty are vested in the Academic Council, which is made up of tenure and non-tenure line faculty, research faculty, senior fellows in some policy centers and institutes, the president of the university, and some other academic administrators, but most matters are handled by the Faculty Senate, made up of 55 elected representatives of the faculty.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>In 2006, President Hennessy launched the Stanford Challenge, a $4.3 billion fund-raising campaign focusing on three components: multidisciplinary research initiatives, initiatives to improve education, and core support.&lt;ref name=StanfordChallenge&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Stanford raised $832.2 million in private donations from 69,350 donors in 2006&#x2013;2007, the most of all U.S. universities.&lt;ref name=&quot;FG facts&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>The <a>Associated Students of Stanford University</a> (ASSU) is the student government for Stanford University and all registered students are members.&lt;ref name=&quot;ASSU&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Its elected leadership consists of the Undergraduate Senate elected by the undergraduate students, the Graduate Student Council elected by the graduate students, and the President and Vice President elected as a <a>ticket</a> by the entire student body.&lt;ref name=&quot;ASSU&quot;/&gt;</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>

<h3>Research centers and institutes</h3>
<p><a>thumb|View of Hoover Tower from Main Quad.</a> Other Stanford-affiliated institutions include the <a>SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory</a> (originally the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center) and the <a>Stanford Research Institute</a>, a now independent institution which originated at the university, in addition to the <a>Stanford Humanities Center</a>.</p>
<p>Stanford also houses the <a>Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace</a>, a major <a>public policy</a> <a>think tank</a> that attracts visiting scholars from around the world, and the <a>Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies</a>, which is dedicated to the more specific study of <a>international relations</a>. Unable to locate a copy in any of its libraries, the Soviet Union was obliged to ask the Hoover Institution for a microfilm copy of its original edition of the first issue of <em><a>Pravda</a></em> (dated March 5, 1917).&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</pre>
<p>Stanford is home to the <a>John S. Knight Fellowships for Professional Journalist</a>.</p>
<h3>Libraries and digital resources</h3>
<p>The Stanford University Libraries hold a collection of more than eight million volumes. The main library in the SU library system is <a>Green Library</a>. <a>Meyer Library</a> holds the vast <a>East Asia</a> collection and the student-accessible media resources. Other significant collections include the Lane Medical Library, Terman Engineering Library, Jackson Business Library, Falconer Biology Library, Cubberley Education Library, Branner Earth Sciences Library, Swain Chemistry and Chemical Engineering Library, Jonsson Government Documents collection, Crown Law Library, Stanford Auxiliary Library (SAL), SLAC Library, Hoover library, Miller Marine Biology Library at Hopkins Marine Station, Music Library, and the university's special collections.

<p>[[Image:Stanford University campus from above.jpg|thumb|View from [[Hoover Tower]] observation deck of the Quad and surrounding area, facing west]] Stanford enrolled 6,602 undergraduate and 11,896 graduate students in 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;CDS&quot;/&gt; Women comprised 48.7% of undergraduates and 39% of professional and graduate students.&lt;ref name=&quot;CDS&quot;/&gt; The freshman retention rate for 2008 was 98%, the four-year graduation rate is 79.4%, and the six-year rate is 94.4%.&lt;ref name=&quot;CDS&quot;/&gt; The relatively low four-year graduation rate is a function of the university's coterminal degree (or &quot;coterm&quot;) program, which allows students to earn a Master's degree as an extension of their undergraduate program.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Stanford awarded 1,646 undergraduate degrees, 1,984 Master's degrees, 673 doctoral degrees, and 271 professional degrees in 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;CDS&quot;/&gt; The most popular Bachelor's degrees were in the social sciences, interdisciplinary studies, and engineering.</p>
<p>Stanford received 25,299 applications for admissions to the undergraduate program in 2007&#x2013;2008, admitting 2,400 (9.8%), and enrolling 1,703 (71%), the lowest percentage in the university's 117-year history.&lt;ref name=&quot;CDS&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 92% of students graduated in the top tenth of their high-school class and the inter-quartile ranges for the <a>SAT</a> were 680&#x2013;780 for math, 670&#x2013;760 for writing, and 650&#x2013;760 for reading.&lt;ref name=&quot;CDS&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>For the class of 2013, Stanford received 5300 single-choice early action applications and accepted 689 of them, for an early admission rate of approximately 13%. This application season Stanford received more than 30,000 total applications from both the regular and early rounds and expects an overall admission rate of about 7.2%, the lowest rate yet in the university's history and more than 2% lower than for the class of 2012.</p>
<p>Stanford's admission process is need-blind for US citizens and permanent residents. The university awarded $75.6 million in financial aid to 2,960 students, an average package of $33,108.&lt;ref name=&quot;CDS&quot;/&gt; Stanford does not require a parental contribution for families with income below $60,000, and families with income below $100,000 currently have tuition charges covered.&lt;ref name=&quot;CDS&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h3>Rankings</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Stanford is consistently ranked among the top universities in the world, both for undergraduate teaching and graduate-level research. The magazine <em><a>U.S. News and World Report</a></em> (USNWR)&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; ranks it fifth among large universities for its undergraduate program in 2009. Stanford was ranked 3rd best research university in the world by the <a>Academic Ranking of World Universities</a> (ARWU) in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; ARWU ranked Stanford 7th in Natural Sciences and Mathematics, 2nd in Engineering/Technology and Computer Sciences, 5th in Life and Agriculture Sciences, 12th in Clinical Medicine and Pharmacy, and 3rd in Social Sciences worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.arwu.org/Institution.jsp?param=Stanford%20University</a>&lt;/ref&gt; The <a>Times Higher Education World University Rankings</a> ranked Stanford 4th best research university in the world in 2010&lt;ref name=&quot;World University Rankings&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (In 2010 <a>Times Higher Education World University Rankings</a> and <a>QS World University Rankings</a> parted ways to produce separate rankings). Its subject rankings in Times Higher 2010 rankings were: engineering and technology : 3rd, life sciences: 3rd, physical sciences: 5th, arts &amp; humanities: 2nd, social sciences: 3rd, clinical, pre-clinical and health sciences: 2nd).&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>According to MINE ParisTech rankings in 2008 measuring the number of Chief Executive Officers among the Fortune Global 500, Stanford is one of the world's top five universities, along with <a>Tokyo University</a>, <a>Harvard University</a>, <a>Keio University</a> and <a>University of Pennsylvania</a>.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.mines-paristech.fr/Actualites/PR/Archives/2008/EMP-ranking.pdf</a>&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.bestuniversities.com/what-are-the-best-universities-in-the-world/</a>&lt;/ref&gt; fourth among national universities by <em><a>The Washington Monthly</a></em>,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; second among &quot;global universities&quot; by <em><a>Newsweek</a></em>,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and tied for 1st with <a>MIT</a> and <a>Columbia University</a> in the first tier among national universities by the <a>Center for Measuring University Performance</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Stanford Law School is ranked third in the nation while its Education School is ranked second and Business School is ranked first according to <em><a>U.S. News and World Report</a></em>. <em>Forbes</em> ranked the Stanford Graduate School of Business at the top in its 2009 &quot;Best Business Schools&quot; list.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Stanford School of Medicine is currently ranked eleventh in research according to <em>U.S. News and World Report 2010</em>. <em>The Princeton Review</em> ranked Stanford as the number one &quot;Dream School&quot; in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2010 <a>QS Global 200 Business Schools Report</a>&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Stanford was placed 4th in North America, having improved its standing from 5th in 2009.</p>
<h3>Arts</h3>
<p>[[Image:Les-bourgeois-de-Calais.jpg|thumb|left|Bronze statues by [[Auguste Rodin]] are scattered through the campus, including these <em><a>Burghers of Calais</a></em>.]] Stanford University is home to the <a>Cantor Center for Visual Arts</a> museum with 24 galleries, sculpture gardens, terraces, and a courtyard first established in 1891 by Jane and Leland Stanford as a memorial to their only child. Notably, the Center possesses the largest collection of Rodin works outside of Paris, France. There are also a large number of outdoor art installations throughout the campus, primarily sculptures, but some murals as well. The Papua New Guinea Sculpture Garden near Roble Hall features handmade wood carvings and &quot;totem poles.&quot;</p>
<p>Stanford has a thriving artistic and musical community. Extracurricular activities include theater groups such as Ram's Head Theatrical Society and the Stanford Shakespeare Society, award-winning <a>a cappella</a> music groups such as the <a>Mendicants</a>, Counterpoint, the Stanford Fleet Street Singers, <a>Harmonics</a>, Mixed Company, Testimony, <a>Talisman</a>, Everyday People, Raagapella, and a group dedicated to performing the works of <a>Gilbert and Sullivan</a>, the Stanford Savoyards. Beyond these, the <a>music department</a> sponsors many ensembles including five choirs, the <a>Stanford Symphony Orchestra</a>, <a>Stanford Taiko</a>, and the Stanford Wind Ensemble.</p>
<p>Stanford's dance community is one of the most vibrant in the country, with an active dance division in the Drama Department and over 30 different dance-related student groups, including the <a>Stanford Band</a>'s <a>Dollie</a> dance troupe.</p>
<p>Perhaps most distinctive of all is its <a>social</a> and <a>vintage dance</a> community, cultivated by dance historian <a>Richard Powers</a> and enjoyed by hundreds of students and thousands of alumni. Stanford hosts monthly informal dances (called Jammix) and large quarterly dance events, including Ragtime Ball (fall), the Stanford Viennese Ball (winter), and Big Dance (spring). Stanford also boasts a student-run swing performance troupe called <a>Swingtime</a> and several alumni performance groups, including Decadance and the Academy of Danse Libre.</p>
<p>The <a>creative writing</a> program brings young writers to campus via the <a>Stegner Fellowship</a>s and other graduate scholarship programs. <em><a>This Boy's Life</a></em> author <a>Tobias Wolff</a> teaches writing to undergraduates and graduate students. Knight Journalism Fellows are invited to spend a year at the campus taking seminars and courses of their choice. There is also an extracurricular writing and performance group called the Stanford Spoken Word Collective, which also serves as the school's poetry slam team.</p>
<p>Stanford also hosts various publishing courses for professionals. Stanford Professional Publishing Course, which has been offered on campus since the late 1970s, brings together international publishing professionals to discuss changing business models in magazine and book publishing.</p>
<h2>Endowment and fundraising</h2>
<p>Stanford was the top fund-raising university in the United States for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2008 with $785 million.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The university's <a>endowment</a>, managed by the <a>Stanford Management Company</a>, was valued at $17.2 billion in 2008 and had achieved an annualized rate of return of 15.1% since 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;FG facts&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; In the economic downturn of January 2009, however, the endowment has dropped 20 to 30 percent.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to the <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em>, &quot;Stanford's endowment has lost approximately $4 billion to $5 billion, or 20 to 30 percent of its value&quot; since 2008. As a result, all campus units are cutting their budgets by 15 percent in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h2>Student life</h2>
<p>[[Image:Stanford-bikes.jpg|thumb|Many students use [[bicycle]]s to get around the large campus.]]</p>
<h3>Dormitories and student housing</h3>
<p>Eighty-nine percent of undergraduate students live in on-campus university housing, partially because first-year students are required to live on campus, and because students are guaranteed housing for all four years of their undergraduate careers.&lt;ref name=&quot;CDS&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Stanford Housing Assignments Office, undergraduates live in 80 different houses, including dormitories, co-ops, <a>row houses</a>, <a>fraternities and sororities</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;ugradres&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; At Manzanita Park, 118 <a>mobile home</a>s were installed as &quot;temporary&quot; housing from 1969 to 1991, but it is now the site of modern dorms Castano, Kimball, and Lantana.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Most student residences are located just outside the campus core, within ten minutes (on foot or bike) of most classrooms and libraries. Some are for freshmen only; others give priority to sophomores, others to both freshmen and sophomores; some are for upperclass students only, and some are open to all four classes. Most residences are co-ed; seven are all-male <a>fraternities</a>, three are all-female <a>sororities</a>, and there is also one all-female non-sorority house, Roth House. In most residences, men and women live on the same floor, but a few dorms are configured for men and women to live on separate floors (single-gender floors), including all Wilbur dorms except for Arroyo and Okada.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 2009-10, the University's housing plan anticipates that all freshmen desiring to live in all-freshman dorms will be accommodated. In the 2009-10 year, almost two-thirds of freshmen will be housed in Stern and Wilbur Halls. The one-third who requested four-class housing will be located in other dormitories throughout campus, including Florence Moore (FloMo).&lt;ref name=&quot;froshhousing&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2008, Stanford unveiled a new pilot plan to test out gender-neutral housing in five campus residences, allowing males and females to live in the same room. This was after concerted student pressure, as well as the institution of similar policies at peer institutions such as <a>Wesleyan</a>, <a>Oberlin</a>, <a>Clark</a>, <a>Dartmouth</a>, <a>Brown</a>, and <a>UPenn</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;genderblind&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Several residences are considered theme houses. The Academic, Language and Culture Houses include EAST (East Asian Studies Theme), Hammarskj&#x00f6;ld (International Theme), Haus Mitteleuropa (Central European Theme), La Casa Italiana (Italian Language and Culture), La Maison Fran&#x00e7;aise (French Language and Culture House), Slavianskii Dom (Slavic/East European Theme House), Storey (Human Biology Theme House), and Yost (Spanish Language and Culture).Cross-Cultural Theme Houses include Casa Zapata (Chicano/Latino Theme in Stern Hall), Muwekma-tah-ruk (American Indian/Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian Theme), Okada (Asian-American Theme in Wilbur Hall), and Ujamaa (Black/African-American Theme in Lagunita Court). Focus Houses include Freshman-Sophomore College (Freshman Focus), Branner Hall (Community Service), Kimball (Arts &amp; Performing Arts), Crothers (Global Citizenship), and Toyon (Sophomore Priority).&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Another famous style of housing at Stanford is the <a>co-ops</a>. These houses feature cooperative living, where residents and eating associates each contribute work to keep the house running, such as cooking meals or cleaning shared spaces. The co-ops on campus are Chi Theta Chi, Columbae, Enchanted Broccoli Forest (EBF), Hammarskj&#x00f6;ld (which is also the International Theme House), Kairos, Terra, and Synergy.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>At any time, around 50 percent of the graduate population lives on campus. Now that construction has concluded on the new Munger graduate residence, this percentage has probably increased. First-year graduate students are guaranteed housing.</p>
<h3>Traditions</h3>
<p><a>right|thumb|Vintage Stanford University postcard</a></p>
<ul>
  <li>Full Moon on the Quad: A student gathering in the Main Quad of the university. Traditionally, seniors exchange kisses with freshmen, although students of all four classes (as well as the occasional graduate student or stranger) have been known to participate.</li>
  <li>Sunday Flicks: A weekly Sunday night film screening in <a>Memorial Auditorium</a>. Usually, students are very loud and crazy during the screenings, and can be seen flying <a>paper airplanes</a> or simply throwing wads of newspaper at each other. Flicks ran into significant financial trouble in 2006 and after an ASSU bail-out became free for all students.</li>
  <li>Steam-tunnelling: The act of exploring the <a>steam tunnels</a> under the Stanford campus.</li>
  <li>Fountain-hopping: The act of running from one fountain on campus to another, or simply leaping/swimming around in any of Stanford's many fountains (such as the Stanford Claw fountain in White Plaza).</li>
  <li><a>Big Game</a> events: The events in the week leading up to the <a>Big Game</a> vs. <a>UC Berkeley</a>, including Gaieties (a musical written, composed, produced, and performed by the students of Ram's Head Theatrical Society), The Bearial (in which the <a>Stanford Band</a> performs a funeral-like procession and pierces a stuffed-animal bear on the tip of the Stanford Claw fountain), and an hourly train whistle that counts down the hours until Big Game, orchestrated by the Stanford Axe Committee.</li>
  <li>Primal scream: Performed by stressed students at midnight during <a>Dead Week</a> (the week prior to finals).</li>
  <li><a>Midnight Breakfast</a>: During Winter quarter dead week, Stanford faculty serves breakfast to students in several locations on campus (you might see a vice-provost refilling orange juice, etc.)</li>
  <li>Viennese Ball: a formal <a>ball</a> with <a>waltzes</a> that was started in the 1970s by students returning from the now-closed Stanford in <a>Vienna</a> overseas program.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</li>
  <li>The Stanford <a>Powwow</a>: Organized by the Stanford American Indian Organization since 1971 and held every <a>Mother's Day</a> weekend.&lt;ref&gt;<a>The 37th Annual Stanford Powwow May 9-11, 2008&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</li>
  <li>Mausoleum Party: An annual <a>Halloween</a> Party at the <a>Stanford Mausoleum</a>, which contains the corpses of <a>Leland Stanford, Jr.</a> and his parents. A 20-year tradition, the Mausoleum party was on hiatus from 2002 to 2005&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; due to a lack of funding from the alumni,&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.stanforddaily.com/cgi-bin/?p=1018874</a>&lt;/ref&gt; but was revived in 2006. In 2008, it was hosted in Old Union rather than at the actual Mausoleum, because rain prohibited generators from being rented.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.stanforddaily.com/cgi-bin/?p=954</a>&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, after fundraising efforts by the Junior Class Presidents and the ASSU Executive, the event was able to return to the Mausoleum despite facing budget cuts earlier in the year.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</li>
  <li>Stanford Charity Fashion Show: A large student-run diversity fashion show showcasing student, local, and international designers that was started in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[charityfashionshow.stanford.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;</li>
  <li>Senior Pub Night: On most Thursdays during the school year, seniors gather at a bar in Palo Alto or San Francisco. The location rotates week to week, and chartered buses are organized to take the seniors safely between the bar and campus.</li>
  <li>Uncommon Man/Uncommon Woman: Stanford does not award honorary degrees,&lt;ref&gt;<a>Stanford Bulletin: Conferral of Degrees</a>&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;<a>Stanford Bulletin 2008/2009: Conferral of Degrees</a>&lt;/ref&gt; but in 1953 the University created the degree of Uncommon Man/Uncommon Woman for individuals who give rare and extraordinary service to the University. The University's highest honor, the degree is not given at prescribed intervals, but only when appropriate to recognize extraordinary service. Recipients include <a>Herbert Hoover</a>, <a>Bill Hewlett</a>, <a>Dave Packard</a>, <a>Lucile Packard</a>, and <a>John Gardner</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</li>
  <li>Birthday Showers: Students get thrown in the shower by their friends at midnight on their birthdays.</li>
  <li>A Capella groups perform in student residences during New Student Orientation and throughout the year. Some of the most notable original songs include those by humor-focused Fleet Street Singers, such as &quot;Everyone Pees in the Shower&quot; and &quot;Pray to the God of Partial Credit.&quot;</li>
  <li><a>The Game</a>: Is a scavenger hunt put on by dorm staff usually in the spring and summer quarters.</li>
  <li>Secret Snowflake: Students are given three dares by anonymous residents within their dorm. These students have to perform these dares (one a night for three nights) in front of the whole dorm. These dare can range from tame activities (e.g. singing Like a Virgin in a wedding dress) to extreme (e.g. nudity, stunts). This week of dares is carried out near the end of fall quarter before Christmas Break.</li>
  <li>Valentine's Day Serenade: In the freshmen dorms, all of the guys in the dorm wake up all of the girls very early in the morning on Valentine's Day. Each girl is given a single rose and is then brought to the dorm lounge where all of the guys serenade the girls with a love song.</li>
  <li>Assassin: Participating students are assigned a target to &quot;kill&quot; with a water gun.  A &quot;kill&quot; is only valid if no other person witnesses the &quot;kill&quot; and the target is &quot;killed&quot; outside of his/her dorm room and bathroom.  Over a period of weeks, targets are eliminated until only one assassin victoriously remains.</li>
</ul>
<p>Former campus traditions include the Big Game bonfire on <a>Lake Lagunita</a> (a seasonal lake usually dry in the fall), which is now inactive because of the presence of endangered salamanders in the lake bed.</p>
<h3>Greek life</h3>
<p>Fraternities and sororities have been active on the Stanford campus since 1891, when the University first opened. In 1944, University President <a>Donald Tresidder</a> banned all Stanford sororities due to extreme competition.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, following <a>Title IX</a>, the Board of Trustees lifted the 33-year ban on sororities in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://cgi.stanford.edu/group/chiomega/cgi-bin/history.php</a>&lt;/ref&gt; Stanford is now home to 29 Greek organizations, including 13 sororities and 16 fraternities, representing 13% of undergraduates. In contrast to many universities, nine of the ten housed Greek organizations live in University-owned houses, the exception being <a>Sigma Chi</a>, which owns its own house (but not the land) on The Row. Six chapters are members of the African American Fraternal and Sororal Association, 11 chapters are members of the Interfraternity Council, 6 chapters belong to the Intersorority Council, and 6 chapters belong to the Multicultural Greek Council.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Stanford is home to three unhoused historically NPHC (<a>National Pan-Hellenic Council</a> or &quot;Divine Nine&quot;) three sororities (<a>Alpha Kappa Alpha</a>, <a>Delta Sigma Theta</a>, and <a>Sigma Gamma Rho</a>) and three unhoused NPHC fraternities (<a>Alpha Phi Alpha</a>, <a>Kappa Alpha Psi</a>, and <a>Phi Beta Sigma</a>). These fraternities and sororities operate under the AAFSA (African American Fraternal Sororal Association) at Stanford.</li>
  <li>Six historically NPC (<a>National Panhellenic Conference</a>) sororities, three of which are unhoused (<a>Alpha Epsilon Phi</a>, <a>Chi Omega</a>, and <a>Kappa Kappa Gamma</a>) and three of which are housed (<a>Delta Delta Delta</a>, <a>Kappa Alpha Theta</a>, and <a>Pi Beta Phi</a>) call Stanford home. These sororities operate under the Stanford Inter-sorority Council (ISC).</li>
  <li>Eleven historically NIC (<a>National Interfraternity Conference</a>) fraternities are also represented at Stanford, including four unhoused fraternities (<a>Alpha Epsilon Pi</a>, <a>Delta Kappa Epsilon</a>, <a>Delta Tau Delta</a>, and <a>Sigma Phi Epsilon</a>), and seven housed fraternities (<a>Kappa Alpha</a>, <a>Kappa Sigma</a>, <a>Phi Kappa Psi</a>, <a>Sigma Alpha Epsilon</a>, <a>Sigma Chi</a>, <a>Sigma Nu</a>, and <a>Theta Delta Chi</a>). These fraternities operate under the Stanford Inter-fraternity Council (IFC).</li>
  <li>There are also four unhoused MGC (Multicultural Greek Council) sororities on campus (<a>Alpha Kappa Delta Phi</a>, <a>Lambda Theta Nu</a>, <a>Sigma Psi Zeta</a>, and <a>Sigma Theta Psi</a>), as well as two unhoused MGC fraternities (<a>Gamma Zeta Alpha</a> and <a>Lambda Phi Epsilon</a>). Lambda Phi Epsilon is recognized by the National Interfraternity Conference (NIC).&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Student groups</h3>
<p>Stanford offers its students the opportunity to engage in over 650 groups.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Groups are often, though not always, partially funded by the University via allocations directed by the student government organization, the ASSU. These funds include &quot;special fees&quot;, which are decided by a Spring Quarter vote by the student body. Groups span from Athletic/Recreational, Careers/Pre-professional, Community Service, Ethnic/Cultural, Fraternities/Sororities, Health/Counseling, Media/Publications, Music/Dance/Creative Arts, Political/Social Awareness to Religious/Philosophical.</p>
<p>Groups include (but are not limited to):</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <em><a>Stanford Daily</a></em> is actually an independent organization, but it is the daily newspaper serving Stanford University, and it has published since the University was founded in 1892.</li>
  <li>The Stanford Axe Committee is the official guardian of the <a>Stanford Axe</a> and the rest of the time assists the <a>Stanford Band</a> as a supplementary spirit group.</li>
  <li>The Stanford Pre-Business Association&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; is the largest business-focused undergraduate organization. It plays an instrumental role in establishing an active link between the industry, alumni, and student communities.</li>
  <li>The <a>Stanford solar car project</a>, where students build a solar-powered car every 2 years and race it in either the <a>North American Solar Challenge</a> or the <a>World Solar Challenge</a>.</li>
  <li>Stanford Astronomical Society organizes viewings of meteor showers, lunar eclipses, and other astronomical events.</li>
  <li>The Stanford Kite Flying Society&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (founded 2008), a group of undergraduates dedicated to flying kites. Society &quot;meetings&quot; are usually on Wilbur Field when it is windy out.</li>
  <li>The Pilipino American Student Union (PASU),&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--Adding reference since the name is a point of contention--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; a culture-oriented community service and social activism group. Also integral to PASU is a traditional performing arts arm called Kayumanggi.</li>
  <li>Stanford Finance is a pre-professional organization aimed at mentoring students who want to enter a career in finance, through mentors and internships.</li>
  <li><a>BASES</a>, the Business Association of Stanford Entrepreneurial Students is one of the largest professional organizations in Silicon Valley, with over 5,000 members. Its goal is to support the next generation of entrepreneurs.</li>
  <li>The Stanford Fleet Street Singers is an all-male <a>Acappella</a> group specializing in comedic original compositions, <a>jazz</a>, and Stanford fight songs. Because Fleet Street maintains Stanford songs as a regular part of its performing repertoire, Stanford University used the group as ambassadors during the University's centennial celebration and commissioned an album, entitled Up Toward Mountains Higher (1999), of Stanford songs which were sent to alumni around the world.</li>
  <li>The Stanford Martial Arts Program (SMAP) is an umbrella organization for 11 different martial arts groups on campus: Aikido, Capoeira, Eskrima, Judo, Jujitsu, Kenpo Karate, Muay Thai, Wing Chun, JKA Shotokan, Taekwondo, and Wushu.</li>
  <li>The <a>Stanford Women In Business</a> (SWIB)&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; is an on-campus business organization consisting of over a board of 40 and 100 active members. Each year, SWIB organizes over 25 events and workshops, hosts a winter and spring conference, and provides mentorship and spring quarter internships.</li>

Stanford has constantly won the NACDA Directors' Cup, The University of North Carolina won the award for best Division I collegiate athletics program in its inaugural year. Since then, Stanford University has won it sixteen straight years, winning sixteen out of the seventeen years it has been offered. It also participates in the <a>Mountain Pacific Sports Federation</a> for indoor <a>track</a> (men and women), <a>water polo</a> (men and women), women's <a>gymnastics</a>, women's <a>lacrosse</a>, men's <a>gymnastics</a>, and men's <a>volleyball</a>. The women's <a>field hockey</a> team is part of the <a>NorPac Conference</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Stanford's traditional sports rival is the <a>University of California, Berkeley</a>, its neighbor to the north in the East Bay.</p>

<p>The winner of the annual &quot;<a>Big Game</a>&quot; between the Cal and Stanford football teams gains custody of <a>the Stanford Axe</a>. The first &quot;Big Game&quot;, played at Haight Street Park in San Francisco on March 19, 1892, established football on the west coast. Stanford won 14 to 10 in front of 8 thousand spectators. Stanford's football team played in the first <a>Rose Bowl</a> in 1902. However, the violence of the sport at the time, coupled with the post-game rioting of drunken spectators, led San Francisco to bar further &quot;Big Games&quot; in the city in 1905. In 1906, David Starr Jordan banned football from Stanford. The 1906&#x2013;1914 &quot;Big Game&quot; contests featured rugby instead of football. Stanford football was resumed in 1919.&lt;ref name=&quot;Starr3&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Stanford won back-to-back Rose Bowls in 1971 and 1972. Stanford has played in 12 Rose Bowls, most recently in 2000. Stanford's <a>Jim Plunkett</a> won the <a>Heisman Trophy</a> in 1970.</p>
<p>Club sports, while not officially a part of Stanford athletics, are numerous at Stanford. Sports include <a>archery</a>, <a>badminton</a>, <a>cheerleading</a>, <a>cricket</a>, <a>cycling</a>, <a>equestrian</a>, <a>hurling</a>, <a>ice hockey</a>, <a>judo</a>, <a>kayaking</a>, <a>men's lacrosse</a>, <a>polo</a>, <a>racquetball</a>, <a>rugby union</a>, <a>squash</a>, <a>skiing</a>, <a>taekwondo</a>, <a>tennis</a>, <a>triathlon</a> and <a>Ultimate</a>. The men's Ultimate team won national championships in 1984 and 2002,&lt;ref name=&quot;UPA College Open Champions&quot;&gt;<a>College Open Champions Ultimate Players Association</a>&lt;/ref&gt; the women's Ultimate team in 1997, 1998, 1999, 2003, 2005, 2006, and 2007,&lt;ref name=&quot;UPA College Women's Champions&quot;&gt;<a>College Women's Champions Ultimate Players Association</a>&lt;/ref&gt; the women's rugby team in 1999, 2005, 2006 and 2008. The cycling team won the 2007 Division I USA Cycling Collegiate Road National Championships.</p>
<p>Until 1930, Stanford did not have a &quot;mascot&quot; name for its athletic teams. In that year, the athletic department adopted the name &quot;Indians.&quot; In 1972, &quot;Indians&quot; was dropped after a complaint of racial insensitivity was lodged by Native American students.

<p>The Stanford sports teams are now officially referred to as the Stanford <a>Cardinal</a>, referring to the deep red color, not the <a>cardinal bird</a>. Cardinal, and later cardinal and white has been the university's official color since the 19th century. The Band's mascot, <a>&quot;The Tree&quot;</a>, has become associated with the school in general. Part of the <a>Leland Stanford Junior University Marching Band (LSJUMB)</a>, the tree symbol derives from the <a>El Palo Alto</a> redwood tree on the Stanford and City of Palo Alto seals.</p>
<p>Stanford hosts an annual <a>U.S. Open Series</a> tennis tournament, the <a>Bank of the West Classic</a>, at <a>Taube Stadium</a>. <a>Cobb Track</a>, <a>Angell Field</a>, and <a>Avery Stadium Pool</a> are considered world-class athletic facilities. <a>Stanford Stadium</a> hosted <a>Super Bowl XIX</a> on January 20, 1985, featuring the local <a>San Francisco 49ers</a> defeating the <a>Miami Dolphins</a> by a score of 38&#x2013;16.</p>
<p>Stanford has won the award for the top ranked collegiate athletic program &mdash; the <a>NACDA Director's Cup</a>, formerly known as the <em>Sears Cup</em> &mdash; every year for the past sixteen years. Stanford has had at least one NCAA team champion every year since the 1976-77 school year.&lt;ref&gt;<a>USA Today, June 22, 2010</a>&lt;/ref&gt; </p>
