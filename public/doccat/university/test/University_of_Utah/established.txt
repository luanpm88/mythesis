<p>The <strong>University of Utah</strong>, also known as <strong>the U</strong> or <strong>the U of U</strong>, is a <a>public</a>, <a>coeducational</a> <a>research university</a> in <a>Salt Lake City</a>, <a>Utah</a>, United States.
The university was established in 1850 as the University of Deseret by the General Assembly of the provisional <a>State of Deseret</a>,&lt;ref name=&quot;sesquicentennial&quot; /&gt; making it Utah's oldest institution of higher education.&lt;ref
name=&quot;fast facts&quot; /&gt; It received its current name in 1892, four years before Utah attained statehood, and moved to its current location in 1900.&lt;ref
name=&quot;fast facts&quot; /&gt; Graduate studies include the <a>S.J. Quinney College of Law</a> and the <a>School of Medicine</a>, Utah's only <a>medical school</a>.&lt;ref

<p>[[Image:MountVanCott.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Block U]] has overlooked the university since 1907&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;]]The university was established on February 28, 1850, as the University of Deseret by the General Assembly of the provisional <a>State of Deseret</a>, and <a>Orson Spencer</a> was appointed as the first chancellor of the university.
Early classes were held in private homes or wherever space could be found.
The university closed in 1853 due to lack of funds and lack of <a>feeder school</a>s.</p>
<p>Following years of intermittent classes in the Salt Lake City Council House, the university began to be reestablished in 1867 under the direction of <a>David O. Calder</a>, who was followed by <a>John R. Park</a> in 1869.
In 1892, the school's name was changed to the University of Utah, and <a>John R. Park</a> began arranging to obtain land belonging to the U.S. Army's <a>Fort Douglas</a> on the east bench of the <a>Salt Lake Valley</a>, where the university moved permanently in 1900.
Additional <a>Fort Douglas</a> land has been granted to the university over the years, and the fort was officially closed on October 26, 1991.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Upon his death in 1900, Dr. John R. Park bequeathed his entire fortune to the university.&lt;ref

One third of the faculty resigned in protest of these dismissals.
Some felt that the dismissals were a result of the <a>LDS Church</a>'s influence on the university, while others felt that they reflected a more general pattern of repressing religious and political expression that might be deemed offensive.
The controversy was largely resolved when Kingsbury resigned in 1916, but university operations were again interrupted by World War I, and later <a>The Great Depression</a> and World War II.
Student enrollment dropped to a low of 3,418 during the last year of World War II, but <a>A.
Ray Olpin</a> was able to make substantial additions to campus following the war, and enrollment reached 12,000 by the time he retired in 1964.
Growth continued throughout the following decades as the university developed into a center for computer, medical, and other research.&lt;ref
<p>During the <a>2002 Winter Olympics</a>, the university hosted the Olympic Village&lt;ref name=&quot;olympic village&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the opening and closing ceremonies.&lt;ref
<p>Most courses take place on the west side of campus, known as lower campus due to its lower elevation.

Venues for performing arts include <a>Kingsbury Hall</a>, used for touring companies and concerts, Pioneer Memorial Theatre, used by the professional <a>Pioneer Theatre Company</a>, David P. Gardner Hall, used by the School of Music and for musical performances, and the Marriott Center for Dance.
The <a>Utah Transit Authority</a> (UTA) runs several buses through the university area as well as the <a>TRAX</a> <a>University Line</a> (<a>light rail</a>), which travels through downtown Salt Lake City, where riders can transfer to the <a>Sandy / Salt Lake Line</a>, and terminates at the <a>Salt Lake City Intermodal Hub</a>, where riders can transfer to <a>FrontRunner</a> (<a>heavy rail</a>).
UTA runs limited trains directly from the university to Sandy on the <a>Sandy / University Line</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
<p>The university is ranked 4th by the <a>EPA</a> for annual <a>green power</a> usage among universities, with 23% of its power coming from <a>wind</a> and <a>solar</a> sources.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
