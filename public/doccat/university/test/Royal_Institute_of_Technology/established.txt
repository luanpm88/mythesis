KTH was founded in 1827 as Sweden's first <a>polytechnic</a> and is one of Scandinavia's largest institutions of higher education in technology, (the largest by certain definitions).
KTH is one of the leading technical universities in <a>Europe</a>  and highly respected worldwide, especially in the domains of technology and natural sciences.</p>
While the original campus was large for its time, KTH very soon outgrew it and the campus was expanded with new buildings.
<p>KTH was founded in 1827 under the name Technological Institute (<em>Teknologiska institutet</em>), following the establishment of polytechnical schools in many European countries the early years of the 19th century, often based on the model of <a>&#x00c9;cole Polytechnique</a> in <a>Paris</a> in 1794.</p>
The models were used intermittently for teaching practical mechanics by different masters until the School of Mechanics (<em>Mekaniska skolan</em>) was founded in 1798.
This is the year from which there has been continuous teaching of technology in Sweden.
A governmental committee was appointed in 1844 to solve the issues, which led to the removal of Schwartz in 1845.
He led a complete reorganisation of the institute in 1846-1848, after which he returned to his post in Falun.
In 1869, the School of Mining in Falun was moved to Stockholm and merged with the institute, and in 1871 the institute took over the <a>civil engineering</a> course previously arranged by the Higher Artillery College in <a>Marieberg</a>.</p>
<p>In 1917, the first buildings of KTH's new campus on <a>Valhallav&#x00e4;gen</a> were completed, and still constitute its main campus.</p>
<p>Although the engineering education of the late 19th and early 20th century were scientifically founded, up until the early 20th century, research as such was not seen as a central activity of an Institute of Technology.
In 1927, KTH was finally granted the right to confer its own doctorates, under the designation <em>Teknologie doktor</em> (Doctor of Technology), and the first five doctors were created in 1929.</p>
From 1989, the shorter  training in technology arranged by the municipal polytechnical schools in Sweden was gradually extended and moved in to the university system, from 1989 as two-year courses and from 1995 alternatively as three-year courses.
R1 was to be the main site for almost all Swedish nuclear research until 1970 when the reactor was finally decommissioned, mostly due to the increased awareness of the risks associated with operating a reactor in a densely populated area of Stockholm.

In 2009, KTH was the only institution among all Sweden's universities to be awarded &quot;Centre of Excellent Quality in Higher Education&quot;(in Computer Science)..
In 2010 the university was ranked 150th in the world by <a>QS World University Rankings</a>, ranking 60th for Engineering &amp; Technology (making it the highest ranked institution in Scandinavia) and 99th in the Natural Sciences.</p>
