Founded in 1969, it traces its roots back to its two earlier predecessor organizations, <a>St.
Dunstan's University</a> and <a>Prince of Wales College</a>, founded in 1855 and 1860.&lt;ref
PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=U1ARTU0003534&lt;/ref&gt; The two institutions were merged in 1969 by the government of <a>Alex Campbell</a> as part of a campaign to integrate the Island's <a>Roman Catholic</a> and <a>Protestant</a> communities, which had previously maintained the two separate institutions of higher learning.
<a>Holland College</a> was later created to fill the void left by the merger of Prince of Wales College into the university.
<p>The University of Prince Edward Island is a non-denominational university established in 1969 by the amalgamation of <a>Prince of Wales College</a> (PWC) founded in 1834, and <a>St.
Dunstan's University</a> (SDU) founded in 1855.&lt;ref
Its predecessor institutions ceased to operate although St. Dunstan's still retains its charter and the lands that were home to Prince of Wales became the campus for Holland College.
<p>UPEI's campus, located at the corner of Belvedere and University Avenues in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island's capital city, is built on 134 acres (54 hectares) of land.
<p>Original SDU buildings in the central quadrangle have been renovated to retain integrity of their exterior aesthetic design while meeting modern standards.
