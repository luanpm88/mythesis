<p> :<em>This section incorporates text translated from the Dutch wikipedia article</em> Utrecht University was founded on March 26, 1636.
<a>Bernardus Schotanus</a>, professor of law and mathemetics, was the university's first <a>rector magnificus</a>.
<p>Utrecht University flourished in the seventeenth century, despite of the competition with the older universities of <a>Leiden</a> (1575), <a>Franeker</a> (1585) and <a>Groningen</a> (1614) and the schools of <a>Harderwijk</a> (1599, university since 1648) and Amsterdam (1632).
Leiden in particular was a strong competitor.
A <a>hortus botanicus</a> was built on the stronghold of <a>Sonnenborgh</a> and three years later the <a>Smeetoren</a> received a astronomical observatory.</p>
<p>The <a>French occupants of the Netherlands</a> in 1806 degraded Utrecht University to '&#x00e9;cole secondaire' (high school), but after the establishment of the <a>Kingdom of the Netherlands</a> in 1813, Utrecht University regained its original rights.
Leiden received the title of 'eerste hoge school' (First University).
Utrecht had a prominent role in the flourishing of Dutch science.
Around 1850 the so called 'Utrechtian School' of science was formed with <a>Pieter Harting</a>, <a>Gerardus J. Mulder</a>, <a>Christophorus H. D. Buys Ballot</a> and <a>Franciscus C. Donders</a> being the leading scientists.
