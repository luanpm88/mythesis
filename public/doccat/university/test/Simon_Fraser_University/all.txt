image_size$$$@@@%%%<h3>Founding</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Simon Fraser University was founded upon the recommendation of a 1958 report entitled <em>Higher Education in British Columbia and a Plan for the Future</em>, by <a>Dr.
established$$$@@@%%%J.B. Macdonald</a>, who recommended the creation of a new university in the Lower Mainland.
nickname$$$@@@%%%The British Columbia Legislature gave formal assent two months later for the establishment of the university.
established$$$@@@%%%In May of the same year Dr. Gordon M. Shrum was appointed as the university's first Chancellor.
calendar$$$@@@%%%From a variety of sites which were offered, Shrum recommended to the provincial government that the summit of Burnaby Mountain be chosen for the new university.
established$$$@@@%%%Architects <a>Arthur Erickson</a> and Geoffrey Massey won a competition to design the university, and construction began in the spring of 1964.
postgrad$$$@@@%%%Eighteen months later, on September 9, 1965, the university began its first semester with 2,500 students.</p>
image_size$$$@@@%%%<h3>Early activism</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p> The campus was noted in the 1960s and early 1970s as a hotbed of political activism, culminating in a crisis in the Department of Political Science, Sociology, and Anthropology in a dispute involving ideological differences among faculty.
mottoeng$$$@@@%%%The resolution to the crisis included the dismantling of the department and its breaking-up into today's separate departments.</p>
alumni$$$@@@%%%<h3>Coat of Arms</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The school's original <a>coat of arms</a> was used from the university's inception until 2006, at which point the Board of Governors voted to adapt the old coat of arms and thereby register a second coat of arms.
postgrad$$$@@@%%%The adaptation replaced two crosslets with books after some in the university asserted the crosses had misled prospective foreign students into believing SFU was a private, religious institution rather than a public, secular one.
calendar$$$@@@%%%In 2007, the university decided to register both the old coat of arms and the revised coat of arms featuring the books.
president$$$@@@%%%In 2007, a new marketing logo was unveiled, consisting of white letters on block red.</p>
