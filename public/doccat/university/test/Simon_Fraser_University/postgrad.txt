Eighteen months later, on September 9, 1965, the university began its first semester with 2,500 students.</p>
The adaptation replaced two crosslets with books after some in the university asserted the crosses had misled prospective foreign students into believing SFU was a private, religious institution rather than a public, secular one.
International students comprise 20% of the graduate student population as a whole and 30-40% in science and technology areas.
Archaeological collections arising from excavations and other research by faculty, staff and students are also housed in the museum.</p>
The new facility accommodates the increasing enrollment of students in the programme and new cultural facilities, including the Fei and Milton Wong Experimental theatre, screening rooms, sound studios, and art galleries.
