<p>Due to the contemporary <a>Brutalist architecture</a> of the WAC Bennett Library and Academic Quadrangle, the main campus has been used for location shots in science fiction television series such as <em><a>Stargate SG-1</a></em>, <em><a>Battlestar Galactica</a></em> and <em><a>Andromeda</a></em>. Its first use as a film set was for the 1972 science fiction film <em><a>The Groundstar Conspiracy</a></em>, in which the entire campus complex was used.
The campus served as a high-tech corporate setting in the film <em><a>Antitrust</a></em>. Recently, in addition to other <a>Vancouver</a>-area landmarks, many parts of the Burnaby campus were used for the filming of the movie <em><a>The 6th Day</a></em> as well as <em><a>Agent Cody Banks</a></em>.
In early 2008, the Burnaby campus was again used for filming, this time for <em><a>The Day the Earth Stood Still</a></em> (2008 Remake).
