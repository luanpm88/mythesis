The <a>University of California, Berkeley</a> (&quot;Cal&quot;) is Stanford's traditional rival, and the two football teams compete annually in the &quot;<a>Big Game</a>&quot;.
<p>The motto of Stanford University, selected by President Jordan, is &quot;<em>Die Luft der Freiheit weht.</em>&quot;
Besides defining the operational structure of the University, the Grant of Endowment made several specific stipulations: &quot;The Trustees ... shall have the power and it shall be their duty:</p>
The &quot;Stanford ratio&quot; of 3:1 remained in place until the early 1960s.
Most of the Board of Trustees advised a temporary closing until finances could be sorted out.
The red tile roofs and solid <a>sandstone</a> masonry are distinctly Californian in appearance and famously complementary to the bright blue skies common to the region, and most of the subsequently erected buildings have maintained consistent exteriors.</p>
Stanford shares much with the city of Palo Alto, including its <a>school district</a> and <a>fire department</a>, although the police forces are separate.

The university also has several sustainability initiatives underway.
<p>The Stanford University Libraries hold a collection of more than eight million volumes.
The main library in the SU library system is <a>Green Library</a>.
There are 20 libraries in all.</p>
statues by [[Auguste Rodin]] are scattered through the campus, including these <em><a>Burghers of Calais</a></em>.]]
There are also a large number of outdoor art installations throughout the campus, primarily sculptures, but some murals as well.
Knight Journalism Fellows are invited to spend a year at the campus taking seminars and courses of their choice.
As a result, all campus units are cutting their budgets by 15 percent in 2009.</p>
Most student residences are located just outside the campus core, within ten minutes (on foot or bike) of most classrooms and libraries.
Most residences are co-ed; seven are all-male <a>fraternities</a>, three are all-female <a>sororities</a>, and there is also one all-female non-sorority house, Roth House.
The one-third who requested four-class housing will be located in other dormitories throughout campus, including Florence Moore (FloMo).
<p>Several residences are considered theme houses.
The co-ops on campus are Chi Theta Chi, Columbae, Enchanted Broccoli Forest (EBF), Hammarskj&#x00f6;ld (which is also the International Theme House), Kairos, Terra, and Synergy.</p>
<li><a>The Game</a>: Is a scavenger hunt put on by dorm staff usually in the spring and summer quarters.</li>
<li>Assassin: Participating students are assigned a target to &quot;kill&quot; with a water gun.
Over a period of weeks, targets are eliminated until only one assassin victoriously remains.</li>
However, following <a>Title IX</a>, the Board of Trustees lifted the 33-year ban on sororities in 1977.
In contrast to many universities, nine of the ten housed Greek organizations live in University-owned houses, the exception being <a>Sigma Chi</a>, which owns its own house (but not the land) on The Row. Six chapters are members of the African American Fraternal and Sororal Association, 11 chapters are members of the Interfraternity Council, 6 chapters belong to the Intersorority Council, and 6 chapters belong to the Multicultural Greek Council.</p>
Groups are often, though not always, partially funded by the University via allocations directed by the student government organization, the ASSU.
<p>Groups include (but are not limited to):</p>
<li>The Stanford Axe Committee is the official guardian of the <a>Stanford Axe</a> and the rest of the time assists the <a>Stanford Band</a> as a supplementary spirit group.</li>
<li>The Stanford Kite Flying Society (founded 2008), a group of undergraduates dedicated to flying kites.
Society &quot;meetings&quot; are usually on Wilbur Field when it is windy out.</li>
<li>The Pilipino American Student Union (PASU), a culture-oriented community service and social activism group.
<li>The <a>Stanford Women In Business</a> (SWIB) is an on-campus business organization consisting of over a board of 40 and 100 active members.
The women's <a>field hockey</a> team is part of the <a>NorPac Conference</a>.
The university offers about 300 athletic scholarships.

<p>The winner of the annual &quot;<a>Big Game</a>&quot; between the Cal and Stanford football teams gains custody of <a>the Stanford Axe</a>.
The 1906&#x2013;1914 &quot;Big Game&quot; contests featured rugby instead of football.
<p>Club sports, while not officially a part of Stanford athletics, are numerous at Stanford.
The cycling team won the 2007 Division I USA Cycling Collegiate Road National Championships.</p>

<p>The Stanford sports teams are now officially referred to as the Stanford <a>Cardinal</a>, referring to the deep red color, not the <a>cardinal bird</a>.
The Band's mascot, <a>&quot;The Tree&quot;</a>, has become associated with the school in general.
Part of the <a>Leland Stanford Junior University Marching Band (LSJUMB)</a>, the tree symbol derives from the <a>El Palo Alto</a> redwood tree on the Stanford and City of Palo Alto seals.</p>
