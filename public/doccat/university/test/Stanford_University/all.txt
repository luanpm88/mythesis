website$$$@@@%%%<p> The <strong>Leland Stanford Junior University</strong>, commonly referred to as <strong>Stanford University</strong> or <strong>Stanford</strong>, is a <a>private research university</a> located in <a>Stanford, California</a>, United States with a strong emphasis on scientific, technological and social science research.
staff$$$@@@%%%The university is located on an  campus in northwestern <a>Santa Clara Valley</a> approximately  northwest of <a>San Jose</a> and  southeast of <a>San Francisco</a>.</p>
staff$$$@@@%%%<p><a>Leland Stanford</a>, a Californian railroad tycoon and politician, founded the university in 1891 in honor of his son, <a>Leland Stanford, Jr.</a> who died of <a>typhoid</a> at the age of 16.
established$$$@@@%%%The university was established as a coeducational and nondenominational institution, but struggled financially after the senior Stanford's 1893 death and much of the campus was damaged by the <a>1906 San Francisco earthquake</a>.
staff$$$@@@%%%Following World War II, Provost <a>Frederick Terman</a> supported faculty and graduates' entrepreneurialism to build self-sufficient local industry in what would become known as <a>Silicon Valley</a>.
staff$$$@@@%%%By 1970, Stanford was home to a <a>linear accelerator</a>, one of the original four <a>ARPANET</a> nodes, and had transformed itself into a major research university in <a>computer science</a>, <a>mathematics</a>, <a>natural sciences</a>, and <a>social sciences</a>.
staff$$$@@@%%%More than 50 Stanford faculty, staff and alumni have won the <a>Nobel Prize</a> (<a>list of Nobel Laureates by university affiliation</a>).
staff$$$@@@%%%Stanford also boasts the largest number of <a>Turing award</a> winners for a single institution.
staff$$$@@@%%%Stanford faculty and alumni have founded many prominent technology companies, including <a>Cisco Systems</a>, <a>Electronic Arts</a>, <a>Google</a>, <a>Hewlett-Packard</a>, <a>LinkedIn</a>, <a>Sun Microsystems</a>, and <a>Yahoo!</a>.</p>
staff$$$@@@%%%<p>The university is organized into seven schools including academic schools of <a>Humanities and Sciences</a> and <a>Earth Sciences</a> as well as professional schools of <a>Business</a>, <a>Education</a>, <a>Engineering</a>, <a>Law</a>, and <a>Medicine</a>.

image_size$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
image_size$$$@@@%%%<h3>Origins</h3>
staff$$$@@@%%%<p>Stanford was founded by <a>Leland Stanford</a>, a <a>railroad</a> magnate, <a>United States Senator</a>, and former <a>California Governor</a>, and his wife, <a>Jane Stanford</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%It is named in honor of their only child, <a>Leland Stanford, Jr.</a>, who died in 1884 just before his 16th birthday.
website$$$@@@%%%His parents decided to dedicate a university to their only son, and Leland Stanford told his wife, &quot;The children of California shall be our children.&quot;</p>

staff$$$@@@%%%Stanford, the university's founder, as painted by [[Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier]] in 1881 and now on display at the <a>Cantor center</a>]] Senator and Mrs. Stanford visited Harvard's President <a>Eliot</a> and asked how much it would cost to duplicate Harvard in <a>California</a>.
image_size$$$@@@%%%Eliot replied that he supposed $15 million would be enough.
staff$$$@@@%%%However, the Stanfords were gracefully rebuffed in securing <a>A.D. White</a>, the president of <a>Cornell University</a>, as Stanford's founding president.
staff$$$@@@%%%Instead, White recommended <a>David Starr Jordan</a>, White's former student and the president of <a>Indiana University</a>.
mottoeng$$$@@@%%%He was their eventual choice to direct Stanford, although they had offered leaders of the Ivy League twice his salary.</p>
mottoeng$$$@@@%%%<p>Locals and members of the university community are known to refer to the school as <strong>The Farm</strong>, a nod to the fact that the university is located on the former site of Leland Stanford's horse farm.</p>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>The motto of Stanford University, selected by President Jordan, is &quot;<em>Die Luft der Freiheit weht.</em>&quot;
staff$$$@@@%%%Translated from the <a>German</a>, this quotation from <a>Ulrich von Hutten</a> means &quot;The wind of freedom blows.&quot;
established$$$@@@%%%The motto was controversial during World War I, when anything in German was suspect; at that time the university disavowed that this motto was official.</pre>
president$$$@@@%%%<p>The university's founding Grant of Endowment from Leland and Jane Stanford was written on November 11, 1885, and accepted by the first Board of Trustees on November 14.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Besides defining the operational structure of the University, the Grant of Endowment made several specific stipulations: &quot;The Trustees ... shall have the power and it shall be their duty:</p>
image_size$$$@@@%%%<ul>
mottoeng$$$@@@%%%  <li>To establish and maintain at such University an educational system, which will, if followed, fit the graduate for some useful pursuit, and to this end to cause the pupils, as easily as may be, to declare the particular calling, which, in life, they may desire to pursue;  ...</li>
established$$$@@@%%%  <li>To prohibit sectarian instruction, but to have taught in the University the immortality of the soul, the existence of an all-wise and benevolent Creator, and that obedience to His laws is the highest duty of man.</li>
established$$$@@@%%%  <li>To have taught in the University the right and advantages of association and co-operation.</li>
established$$$@@@%%%<li>To afford equal facilities and give equal advantages in the University to both sexes.</li>
established$$$@@@%%%<li>To maintain on the Palo Alto estate a farm for instruction in agriculture in all its branches.&quot;</li>
image_size$$$@@@%%%</ul>
president$$$@@@%%%<p>The cornerstone was laid on May 14, 1887, and after six years of planning and building, the university officially opened on October 1, 1891, to 559 students and 15 faculty members, seven of them from Cornell.
calendar$$$@@@%%%When the school opened, students were not charged for tuition, a program which lasted into the 1930s.
established$$$@@@%%%Among the first class of students was a young future president <a>Herbert Hoover</a>, who would claim to be the first student <em>ever</em> at Stanford, by virtue of having been the first person in the first class to sleep in the dormitory.</p>
staff$$$@@@%%%<p>The original 'inner quad' buildings (1887&#x2013;91) were designed by <a>Frederick Law Olmsted</a>, <a>Francis A. Walker</a>, <a>Charles Allerton Coolidge</a>, and Leland Stanford himself.</p>
image_size$$$@@@%%%<h4>Coeducation</h4>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The school was established as a <a>coeducation</a>al institution.
postgrad$$$@@@%%%However, Jane Stanford soon put a policy in place limiting female enrollment to 500 students because of the large number of women students enrolling.
calendar$$$@@@%%%She did not want the school to become &quot;the <a>Vassar</a> of the West&quot; because she felt that would not be an appropriate memorial for her son.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1933 the policy was modified to specify an undergraduate male:female ratio of 3:1.
nickname$$$@@@%%%The &quot;Stanford ratio&quot; of 3:1 remained in place until the early 1960s.
calendar$$$@@@%%%By the late 1960s the &quot;ratio&quot; was about 2:1 for undergraduates, but much more skewed at the graduate level, except in the humanities.
calendar$$$@@@%%%As of 2005, undergraduate enrollment is split nearly evenly between the sexes, but males outnumber females about 2:1 at the graduate level.</p>
image_size$$$@@@%%%<h4>Early finances</h4>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>When Senator Stanford died in 1893, the continued existence of the university was in jeopardy.
website$$$@@@%%%A $15 million government lawsuit against Senator Stanford's estate, combined with the <a>Panic of 1893</a>, made it extremely difficult to meet expenses.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Most of the Board of Trustees advised a temporary closing until finances could be sorted out.
established$$$@@@%%%However, Jane Stanford insisted that the university remain in operation.
established$$$@@@%%%Faced with the possibility of financial ruin for the University she took charge of financial, administrative, and development matters at the university 1893-1905; from her experience as a mother and housewife, she ran the institution as a household.
mottoeng$$$@@@%%%For the next several years, she paid salaries out of her personal resources, even pawning her jewelry to keep the university going.
established$$$@@@%%%When the lawsuit was finally dropped in 1895, a university holiday was declared.</p>
staff$$$@@@%%%<p><a>Edward Alsworth Ross</a> gained fame as a founding father of American sociology; in 1900 Jane Stanford fired him for radicalism and racism, unleashing a major academic freedom case.</p>
image_size$$$@@@%%%<p>Jane Stanford's actions were sometimes eccentric.
postgrad$$$@@@%%%In 1897, she directed the board of trustees &quot;that the students be taught that everyone born on earth has a soul germ, and that on its development depends much in life here and everything in Life Eternal&quot;.
postgrad$$$@@@%%%She forbade students from sketching nude models in life-drawing class, banned automobiles from campus, and did not allow a hospital to be constructed so that people would not form an impression that Stanford was unhealthy.
postgrad$$$@@@%%%Between 1899 and 1905, she spent $3 million on a grand construction scheme building lavish memorials to the Stanford family, while university faculty and self-supporting students were living in poverty.</p>
image_size$$$@@@%%%<h4>Hoover Institution</h4>
free_label$$$@@@%%%<p>The <a>Hoover Institution</a> (full name: the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution, and Peace) at Stanford was set up by <a>Herbert C. Hoover</a>, one of Stanford's first graduates.
established$$$@@@%%%He had been in charge of American relief efforts in Europe after World War I before his election as president of the United States in 1928.
president$$$@@@%%%Hoover's express purpose was to collect the records of contemporary history as it was happening.
free_label$$$@@@%%%Hoover's helpers frequently risked their lives to rescue documentary and rare printed material, especially from countries under Nazi or Communist rule.
calendar$$$@@@%%%Their many successes included the papers of <a>Rosa Luxembourg</a>, the Goebbels diaries, and the records of the Russian secret police in Paris.
established$$$@@@%%%Research institutes were also set up under Hoover's influence, though inevitably there were to be clashes between the moving force, Hoover, and the host university.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1960, W. Glenn Campbell was appointed director and substantial budget increases soon led to corresponding increases in acquisitions and related research projects.
established$$$@@@%%%Despite student unrest in the 1960s, the institution continued to thrive and develop closer relations with Stanford.
calendar$$$@@@%%%In particular, the Chinese and Russian collections grew considerably.
mottoeng$$$@@@%%%The Institute increasingly became a conservative think tank, with ties to Washington, especially since 1980.
established$$$@@@%%%It continues as an integral component of the University.</p>
image_size$$$@@@%%%<h3>Post 1945</h3>
image_size$$$@@@%%%<h4>Biology</h4>
mottoeng$$$@@@%%%<p>The biological sciences department evolved rapidly from 1946 to 1972 as its research focus changed, due to the Cold War and other historically significant conditions external to academia.
alumni$$$@@@%%%Stanford science went through three phases of experimental direction during that time.
location$$$@@@%%%In the early 1950s the department remained fixed in the classical independent and self-directed research mode, shunning interdisciplinary collaboration and excessive government funding.
calendar$$$@@@%%%Between the 1950s and mid-1960s biological research shifted focus to the molecular level.
calendar$$$@@@%%%Then, from the late 1960s onward, Stanford's goal became applying research and findings toward humanistic ends.
established$$$@@@%%%Each phase was preempted by larger social issues, such as the escalation of the Cold War, the launch of Sputnik, and public concern over <a>medical abuses</a>.</em></p>
image_size$$$@@@%%%<h4>High tech</h4>
alumni$$$@@@%%%<p>A powerful sense of regional solidarity accompanied the rise of Silicon Valley.
established$$$@@@%%%From the 1890s, the university's leaders saw its mission as service to the West and shaped the school accordingly.
calendar$$$@@@%%%At the same time, the perceived exploitation of the West at the hands of eastern interests fueled booster-like attempts to build self-sufficient indigenous local industry.
calendar$$$@@@%%%Thus, regionalism helped align Stanford's interests with those of the area's high-tech firms for the first fifty years of Silicon Valley's development.
calendar$$$@@@%%%The distinctive regional ethos of the West during the first half of the 20th century is an ingredient of Silicon Valley's already prepared environment, an ingredient that would-be replicators ignore at their peril.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>During the 1940s and 1950s, <a>Frederick Terman</a>, as dean of engineering and provost,  encouraged faculty and graduates to start their own companies.
staff$$$@@@%%%He is credited with nurturing <a>Hewlett-Packard</a>, <a>Varian Associates</a>, and other high-tech firms, until what would become <a>Silicon Valley</a> grew up around the Stanford campus.
calendar$$$@@@%%%Terman is often called &quot;the father of Silicon Valley.&quot;</p>
image_size$$$@@@%%%<h4>Physics</h4>
calendar$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1962-70 negotiations took place between the Cambridge Electron Accelerator Laboratory (shared by Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology), the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, and the US Atomic Energy Commission over the proposed 1970 construction of the Stanford Positron Electron Asymmetric Ring (SPEAR).
calendar$$$@@@%%%It would be the first US electron-positron colliding beam storage ring.
calendar$$$@@@%%%Paris (2001) explores the competition and cooperation between the two university laboratories and presents diagrams of the proposed facilities, charts detailing location factors, and the parameters of different project proposals between 1967 and 1970.
staff$$$@@@%%%Several rings were built in Europe during the five years that it took to obtain funding for the project, but the extensive project revisions resulted in a superior design that was quickly constructed and paved the way for Nobel Prizes in 1976 for <a>Burton Richter</a> and in 1995 for <a>Martin Perl</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%During 1955-85, solid state technology research and development at Stanford University followed three waves of industrial innovation made possible by support from private corporations, mainly Bell Telephone Laboratories, Shockley Semiconductor, Fairchild Semiconductor, and Xerox PARC.
staff$$$@@@%%%In 1969 the <a>Stanford Research Institute</a> operated one of the four original nodes that comprised <a>ARPANET</a>, predecessor to the <a>Internet</a>.</p>

staff$$$@@@%%%<p>In the summer of 1886, when the campus was first being planned, Stanford brought the president of <a>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>, <a>Francis Amasa Walker</a>, and prominent <a>Boston</a> landscape architect <a>Frederick Law Olmsted</a> westward for consultations.
established$$$@@@%%%Olmsted worked out the general concept for the campus and its buildings, rejecting a hillside site in favor of the more practical flatlands.
staff$$$@@@%%%<a>Charles Allerton Coolidge</a> then developed this concept in the style of his late mentor, <a>Henry Hobson Richardson</a>, in the <a>Richardsonian Romanesque</a> style, characterized by rectangular stone buildings linked by arcades of half-circle arches.
established$$$@@@%%%The original campus was also designed in the Spanish-colonial style common to California known as <a>Mission Revival</a>.
nickname$$$@@@%%%The red tile roofs and solid <a>sandstone</a> masonry are distinctly Californian in appearance and famously complementary to the bright blue skies common to the region, and most of the subsequently erected buildings have maintained consistent exteriors.</p>
staff$$$@@@%%%<p>Much of this first construction was destroyed by the <a>1906 San Francisco earthquake</a>, but the university retains the Quad, the old Chemistry Building (which is not in use and has been boarded up since the 1989 <a>Loma Prieta earthquake</a>), and Encina Hall (the residence of <a>Herbert Hoover</a>, <a>John Steinbeck</a>, and <a>Anthony Kennedy</a> during their times at Stanford).
website$$$@@@%%%After the 1989 earthquake inflicted further damage, the university implemented a billion-dollar capital improvement plan to retrofit and renovate older buildings for new, up-to-date uses.</p>
staff$$$@@@%%%<p>Stanford University is actually its own <a>census-designated place</a> within <a>unincorporated</a> <a>Santa Clara County</a>, although some of the university land (including the <a>Stanford Shopping Center</a> and the <a>Stanford Research Park</a>) is within the city limits of Palo Alto.

image_size$$$@@@%%%<h3>Faculty residences</h3>
calendar$$$@@@%%%<p>One of the benefits of being a Stanford faculty member is the &quot;Faculty Ghetto&quot;, where faculty members can live within walking or biking distance of campus.
chancellor$$$@@@%%%The Faculty Ghetto is composed of land owned entirely by Stanford.
calendar$$$@@@%%%Similar to a <a>condominium</a>, the houses can be bought and sold but the land under the houses is rented on a 99-year lease.
established$$$@@@%%%Houses in the &quot;Ghetto&quot; appreciate and depreciate, but not as rapidly as overall <a>Silicon Valley</a> values.
established$$$@@@%%%However, it remains an expensive area in which to own property, and the average price of single-family homes on campus is actually higher than in Palo Alto.
calendar$$$@@@%%%Stanford itself enjoys the rapid capital gains of Silicon Valley landowners, although by the terms of its founding the university cannot sell the land.</p>
image_size$$$@@@%%%<h3>Non-main campus</h3>
staff$$$@@@%%%<p>On the founding grant but away from the main campus, <a>Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve</a> is a nature reserve owned by the university and used by wildlife biologists for research.
staff$$$@@@%%%<a>Hopkins Marine Station</a>, located in <a>Pacific Grove, California</a>, is a <a>marine biology</a> research center owned by the university since 1892.
staff$$$@@@%%%The university also has its own golf course and a seasonal lake (<a>Lake Lagunita</a>, actually an irrigation reservoir), both home to the endangered <a>California Tiger Salamander</a>.

location$$$@@@%%%<h3>Dormitories and student housing</h3>
doctoral$$$@@@%%%<p>Eighty-nine percent of undergraduate students live in on-campus university housing, partially because first-year students are required to live on campus, and because students are guaranteed housing for all four years of their undergraduate careers.
staff$$$@@@%%%According to the Stanford Housing Assignments Office, undergraduates live in 80 different houses, including dormitories, co-ops, <a>row houses</a>, <a>fraternities and sororities</a>.
website$$$@@@%%%At Manzanita Park, 118 <a>mobile home</a>s were installed as &quot;temporary&quot; housing from 1969 to 1991, but it is now the site of modern dorms Castano, Kimball, and Lantana.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Most student residences are located just outside the campus core, within ten minutes (on foot or bike) of most classrooms and libraries.
website$$$@@@%%%Some are for freshmen only; others give priority to sophomores, others to both freshmen and sophomores; some are for upperclass students only, and some are open to all four classes.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Most residences are co-ed; seven are all-male <a>fraternities</a>, three are all-female <a>sororities</a>, and there is also one all-female non-sorority house, Roth House.
staff$$$@@@%%%In most residences, men and women live on the same floor, but a few dorms are configured for men and women to live on separate floors (single-gender floors), including all Wilbur dorms except for Arroyo and Okada.
established$$$@@@%%%Beginning in 2009-10, the University's housing plan anticipates that all freshmen desiring to live in all-freshman dorms will be accommodated.
established$$$@@@%%%In the 2009-10 year, almost two-thirds of freshmen will be housed in Stern and Wilbur Halls.
nickname$$$@@@%%%The one-third who requested four-class housing will be located in other dormitories throughout campus, including Florence Moore (FloMo).
established$$$@@@%%%In April 2008, Stanford unveiled a new pilot plan to test out gender-neutral housing in five campus residences, allowing males and females to live in the same room.
staff$$$@@@%%%This was after concerted student pressure, as well as the institution of similar policies at peer institutions such as <a>Wesleyan</a>, <a>Oberlin</a>, <a>Clark</a>, <a>Dartmouth</a>, <a>Brown</a>, and <a>UPenn</a>.</p>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>Several residences are considered theme houses.

president$$$@@@%%%Focus Houses include Freshman-Sophomore College (Freshman Focus), Branner Hall (Community Service), Kimball (Arts &amp; Performing Arts), Crothers (Global Citizenship), and Toyon (Sophomore Priority).</p>
calendar$$$@@@%%%<p>Another famous style of housing at Stanford is the <a>co-ops</a>.
mottoeng$$$@@@%%%These houses feature cooperative living, where residents and eating associates each contribute work to keep the house running, such as cooking meals or cleaning shared spaces.
nickname$$$@@@%%%The co-ops on campus are Chi Theta Chi, Columbae, Enchanted Broccoli Forest (EBF), Hammarskj&#x00f6;ld (which is also the International Theme House), Kairos, Terra, and Synergy.</p>
type$$$@@@%%%<p>At any time, around 50 percent of the graduate population lives on campus.
