Despite some more contemporary building developments further away from the centre, Uppsala's historic centre continues to be dominated by the presence of the university.</p>
To the right is the 17th century Oxenstierna Palace, which in the 18th century was used for the university hospital, and now houses the Faculty of Law.
In the center a part of <em>Skytteanum</em> (the residence of the <em>professor skytteanus</em>) can be seen.
At the end of the century the situation had changed, and Uppsala became a bastion of Lutheranism, which Duke Charles, the third of the sons of Gustavus Vasa to eventually become king (as <a>Charles IX</a>) used to consolidate his power and eventually oust his nephew <a>Sigismund</a> from the throne.
In 1599 the number of students was approximately 150.
In 1600 the first post-reformation conferment of degrees took place.
In the same year, the antiquarian and mystic <a>Johannes Bureus</a> designed and engraved the seal of the university, which is today used as part of the logotype.</p>
The immediate rule was the responsibility of the <a>consistory</a>, to which belonged all the professors of the university, and the <a>rector magnificus</a>, who was elected for a semester at the time; the latter position circulated among the professors, each of whom sometimes held it several times.</p>
During the late 16th and early 17th centuries (and perhaps even earlier), the university was located to the old chapter house parallel to the south side of the cathedral, later renamed the <em>Academia Carolina</em>.
In 1622-1625 a new university building was built east of the cathedral, the so-called <em>Gustavianum</em>, named after the reigning king.
In the 1630s, the total number of students were about one thousand.</p>
His most significant remaining architectural work is the anatomical theatre, which was added to Gustavianum in the 1660s and crowned with the characteristic cupola for which the building is today known.</p>
<p>A gifted scientist, architect and engineer, Rudbeck was the dominant personality of the university in the late 17th century who laid some of the groundwork for Linnaeus and others, but he is perhaps more known today for the pseudohistorical speculations of his <em>Atlantica</em>, which consumed much of his later life.
When large parts of Uppsala burned down in 1702, Gustavianum, which contained the university library and its many valuable manuscripts, escaped the fire; local lore has it that the aging Rudbeck stood on the roof directing the work of fighting the fire.</p>

The university was not immune to the parliamentary struggle between the parties known as the &quot;Hats&quot; and the &quot;Caps&quot;, with the former having a preference for hard sciences and practical knowledge.
In the following years the issue continued to be debated at the universities.
In 1892, she founded the Uppsala Women's Student Association, who set up spex performances and other things enjoyed by male students but from which the women were excluded at the time.
<p>The governing board of the university is the <a>consistory</a>, with representatives of the faculties as well as members representing the students and non-academic employees (3 professors and 3 students), and a number of university outsiders appointed by the Swedish government (10 people).
<p>Since the last reorganization in 1999 the university has a separate body called the <em>academic senate</em>, which is a wider, but mostly advisory group representing teaching staff / researchers and students.
The executive head of the university is the <em>rector magnificus</em> (that also have the title &quot;vice-chancellor&quot;), whose deputy is the <em>prorector</em>.
<li>The <em>disciplinary domain of Arts and Social Sciences</em> includes the <strong>Faculty of Arts</strong>*, the <strong>Faculty of Social Sciences</strong>*, the <strong>Faculty of Languages</strong>*, the <strong>Faculty of Theology</strong> and the <strong>Faculty of Law</strong>.</li>
In the mid-18th century, there were plans to move it back to the Academia Carolina or a new building on the same spot.
<p>The first clinic with the specific intention to facilitate the practical education of medical students was the <em>Nosocomium Academicum</em>, founded in 1708 and located to the Oxenstierna Palace at Riddartorget beside the cathedral (see illustration above).
The system of dividing students into nations according to origin can ultimately be traced back to the nations at the medieval <a>University of Paris</a> and other early medieval universities, but the Uppsala nations appear only about 1630&#x2013;1640, most likely under influence of the <em><a>Landsmannschaft</a>en</em> which existed at some of the German universities visited by Swedish students.
The student at the faculty of Pharmacy were also exempt from the compulsory membership in the nations, but most pharmacy-students belonged to one.
However they were obliged to take up membership in the Pharmaceutical Association of Uppsala Students, an organisation having the same role as the nations and the student union at the rest of the university.</p>
Its leader has the title of <em>director musices</em>.
Both have partial roots in the 17th century institution of extracurricular exercises for students from the nobility.</p>
Leaders of the activities are the Academy Stable Master and the <em>Inspector Equitandi</em> (currently Marianne Andersson, Head of the university's Legal Affairs Office).
Leader of the musical activities is the <em>director musices</em>, who is the conductor of the <a>Royal Academic Orchestra</a> The current Director Musices is Professor Stefan Karpe.
As of 2005, the position is held by graphic artist Ulla Fries.
Although rowing never got the strong position it has at the English universities, an annual Uppsala-Lund regatta has been arranged since 1992, between rowing teams from Uppsala and <a>Lund University</a>.
Each year there is at least one full eight crew with cox competing, with both men's and women's teams present.
During the 20th century several <a>Nobel laureates</a> in the sciences have been Uppsala alumni or professors at the university.</p>
Students at Uppsala consider this song the un-official anthem of the University.</p>
