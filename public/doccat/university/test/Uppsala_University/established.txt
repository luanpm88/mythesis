<p><strong>Uppsala University</strong> () is a research <a>university</a> in <a>Uppsala</a> and is the oldest university in <a>Scandinavia</a>, founded in 1477.
Uppsala also has an important historical place in Swedish national culture, identity and for the Swedish establishment: in historiography, literature, politics, and music.
Many aspects of Swedish academic culture in general, such as the white <a>student cap</a>, originated in Uppsala.
Of its annual turnover of around 4.3 billion SEK (approx.
<p>As with most medieval universities, Uppsala University initially grew out of an ecclesiastical center.
Uppsala's bull, which granted the university its corporate rights, was issued by <a>Pope Sixtus IV</a> in 1477, and established a number of provisions.
Among the most important of these was that the university was officially given the same freedoms and privileges as the <a>University of Bologna</a>.
The archbishop of Uppsala was also named as the university's <a>Chancellor</a>, and was charged with maintaining the rights and privileges of the university and its members.</p>
<p><a>thumb|In the late 16th and early 17th century the university was mainly located in the old chapter house, later renamed <em>Academia Carolina</em>.

<p>The turbulent period of the reformation of King <a>Gustavus Vasa</a> resulted in a drop in the already relatively insignificant number of students in Uppsala, which was seen as a center of <a>Catholicism</a> and of potential disloyalty to the Crown.
<a>The Meeting of Uppsala</a> in 1593 established <a>Lutheran</a> orthodoxy in Sweden, and Charles and the Council of state gave new privileges to the university on August 1 of the same year.</p>
<p>Theology still had precedence, but in the privileges of 1593, the importance of a university to educate secular servants of the state was also emphasized.
Three of the seven professorial chairs which were established were in Theology; of the other four, three were in Astronomy, Physics (or general natural sciences) and Latin eloquence.
An eighth chair, in Medicine, was established in 1595 but received no appointee for several years.
Sweden both grew through conquests and went through a complete overhaul of its administrative structure.
Beside Uppsala, new universities were founded in more distant parts of the <a>Swedish Realm</a>, the <a>University of Dorpat</a> (present-day Tartu) in Estonia (1632) and the <a>University of &#x00c5;bo</a> in Finland (1640).
After the Scanian provinces were taken from Denmark, <a>Lund University</a> was founded in 1666.</p>
<p>Instrumental in the reforms of the early 17th century Swedish state was the long-dominant Chancellor <a>Axel Oxenstierna</a>, who had spent his own student days in German universities and who for the last years before his death was also chancellor of the university.
King <a>Gustavus Adolphus</a> showed the university a keen interest and increased the professorial chairs from eight to thirteen in 1620, and again to seventeen in 1621.
The king's former private tutor, <a>Johan Skytte</a>, who was made chancellor of the university in 1622, donated the Skyttean chair in Eloquence and Government which still exists.
The university received a stable structure with its constitution of 1626.
The head of the university was to be the <a>chancellor</a>, his deputy was the &quot;pro-chancellor&quot; (always the <a>archbishop</a> <em>ex officio</em>).
Returning in 1654, he received an assistantship in Medicine in 1655, and had already gone to work on a program of improving aspects of the university.
With the patronage of the university chancellor <a>Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie</a>, Rudbeck was made full professor in 1660, was elected rector for two terms, despite his youth, and started a revision of the work of the other professors and a building spree with himself as architect.
Designed by architect [[Carl H&#x00e5;rleman]] and completed in 1755, it remained the administrative core of the university for a long time.]]
The Hat government then in power established a chair in economics (<em>&#x0152;conomia publica</em>) in 1741 and called <a>Anders Berch</a> as its first incumbent.
This was the first professorship in economics outside Germany, and possibly the third in Europe (the first chairs having been established in <a>Halle</a> and <a>Frankfurt (Oder)</a> in 1727).
University studies had until this time been very informal in their overall organization, with the all-purpose <em>philosophi&#x00e6; magister</em>-degree being the only one frequently conferred and many never graduating, as there were no degree applicable to their intended area of work (and well-connected aristocratic students often not graduating as they did not need to).
He also modified Gustavianum, designed a new conservatory for Linnaeus' botanical garden and built the new Consistory house, which was to be the administrative core of the university.</p>
<p>Another magnificent royal donation was that of the large baroque garden of the castle, given by <a>Gustavus III</a> to the university when it was obvious that the old botanical garden was insufficient.
The old garden of Rudbeck and Linnaeus was largely left to decay, but was reconstructed in the years between 1918 and 1923 according to the specifications of Linnaeus in his work <em>Hortus Upsaliensis</em> from 1745.</p>
The issue of women's right to study at universities was raised during the very last session of the estate parliament in 1865 in a motion from Carl Johan Svens&#x00e9;n, a member of the farmers' estate.
In 1870, it was decided to let women take the secondary school examination (&quot;studentexamen&quot;) that gave the right to entry at universities and the right to study and complete degrees at the faculties of Medicine in Uppsala and Lund and at the Caroline Institute of Medicine and Surgery in Stockholm.
Women's rights to higher education was extended in 1873, when all degrees except those in the faculties of theology and the licentiate degree in Law were made accessible for women.</p>
With a royal dispensation, she was allowed to enter university in Uppsala in 1872, the year before studies at the Philosophical faculty would actually be made generally available to women.
She studied modern European languages and was the first woman in Sweden to complete an academic degree when she finished a fil.
kand. in 1875.
The first woman in Sweden to complete a doctoral degree was <a>Ellen Fries</a> (1855&#x2013;1900), who entered Uppsala university in 1877 and became a Ph.D. in history in 1883.
Defending a dissertation in history in 1900, she became the second woman to finish a doctorate at a Swedish university.
After years of conflicts with the professor of civil law A. O. Winroth and with the university board, she died in 1911 from an overdose of sleeping-powder.</p>
This was changed in 1925, and the first woman to hold a professorial chair at Uppsala University was <a>Gerd Enequist</a>, appointed professor of human geography in 1949.</p>
<p>Through division of faculties and the addition of a previously independent school of Pharmacy as a new faculty, the traditional four-faculty organization of European universities has evolved into the present nine faculties:</p>
The Faculty of Pharmacy was originally an independent institute in Stockholm, which was in 1968 moved to Uppsala and incorporated with the university.</li>
This has however never been a separate institution, but only a unit within the Faculty of Science and Technology and use of the term has been phased out after the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences was renamed the Faculty of Sciences and Technology in the 1990s.</li>
<li>The <strong>Faculty of Educational Sciences</strong>, formerly the Department of Education, was in 2002 raised to the status of a faculty in its own right, but does not belong to any of the three disciplinary domains.</li>
: &lt;small&gt;**The Faculty of Pharmacy was originally a school in Stockholm, in 1968 moved to Uppsala and incorporated with the university.&lt;/small&gt;</p>
<h3>University Library</h3>
[[Carolina Rediviva]], the main building of the university library, designed by <a>Carl Fredrik Sundvall</a> and completed in 1841.]]
The university library holds about 5.25 million volumes of books and periodicals (131,293 shelf meters), 61,959 manuscripts, 7,133 music prints, and 345,734 maps and other graphic documents.
<p>The most widely recognized building of the <a>university library</a> is <a>Carolina Rediviva</a>, the &quot;revived Carolina&quot;, thus named in reference to <em>Academia Carolina</em> (see illustration), which held the university library from the earliest times until 1691, when it was moved to the upper floor of Gustavianum, where it miraculously survived the great city fire of 1702.
The present Carolina Rediviva was built in a different place and completed in 1841.</p>
<p>The present university library system comprises 19 branches, including the one in the Carolina building.</p>
<h3>Uppsala University Hospital</h3>
<p>The university hospital is actually older than the university, as it goes back to the earliest hospital, founded in Uppsala in 1302, much later merged with the university clinic.
A new hospital, which later became the Uppsala county hospital, was built in its place, but was moved out of the town in 1811.</p>
<p>The present <em>Akademiska sjukhuset</em> was founded in 1850 as an organizational merger of the county hospital and the university clinic, and a new building was inaugurated in 1867 on the hill below <a>Uppsala Castle</a> to the southeast.

<p>The compulsory membership in a student union was abolished July 1, 2010, but the unions will still be the representing organisations in the university boards and committees.</p>
<p><a>thumb|Student singers marching down the staircase in Carolina Rediviva, on the occasion of the 400th anniversary of the university in 1877.
The &quot;staircase march&quot; (<em>trappmarschen</em>) when the singers led the audience in a march out of the hall where the concert was held, is an annual tradition that was later moved to the new main university building completed in 1887.
The University's <a>Royal Academic Orchestra</a> was founded in 1627.
Affiliated with the University are three choirs, the mixed <a>Uppsala University Choir</a> (<em>Allm&#x00e4;nna S&#x00e5;ngen</em>), founded in 1830, the male choir <a>Orphei Dr&#x00e4;ngar</a>, founded in 1853, and the <a>Academy Chamber Choir of Uppsala</a>, founded in 1957.
<p>An important name in the recent history of the choirs is <a>Eric Ericson</a>, who was conductor of both Orphei Dr&#x00e4;ngar and the Chamber Choir.
In honour of Ericson, the <a>F&#x00f6;reningsSparbanken</a> endowed the Eric Ericson Chair in Choral Directing, and the Uppsala University Choral Centre was inaugurated in 2000.
<p>Sports play a very small role in the life of the university, compared to British and especially U.S. universities, but have existed in various forms since the early 17th century.
The initiative came from Chancellor <a>Axel Oxenstierna</a>, who saw the value in a well-educated class of civil servants and the danger to his own class if its members would fall behind in academic education compared to those students who came from the lower estates.
An &quot;exercise yard&quot;, built for the riding and fencing exercises, was demolished in the late 19th century to give place to the new University Hall.
<li><em>Riding</em>, arranged by the Equestrian department of the University, which has its own stables.
The university appoints an established artist as Drawing Master.
The <a>Upsala Sims&#x00e4;llskap</a>, &quot;Uppsala Swimming Society&quot;, which is the oldest swimming club in the world, was founded in 1796 by the mathematician <a>J&#x00f6;ns Svanberg</a>.
It had no formal connection to the university, but all its earliest members came from academic life.
Svanberg even arranged a mock graduation ceremony, a <em>simpromotion</em>, in parody of the university ceremonies, where those who had graduated from its swimming training were awarded &quot;degrees&quot; of master (<em>magister</em>) and bachelor (<em>kandidat</em>).
<p>An attempt was made in the 1870s to introduce academic rowing after the <a>Oxbridge</a> model.
With the recent victory for Uppsala in 2005, the score stands 24 - 23 in Uppsala's favor.</p>
<p>Uppsala University has signed student exchange agreements with about 500 universities across all parts of the world.
It takes part in the <a>Erasmus programme</a> programme and the Nordplus programme.Uppsala University has signed university-wide student exchange programmes with the following universities (selection):</p>
<p>Uppsala University places well in many rankings.
Hammarskj&#x00f6;ld and Blix both graduated from the Uppsala Faculty of Law, as did the Swedish Minister of Foreign Affairs <a>Anna Lindh</a>, who was assassinated in 2003.</p>
<a>J&#x00f6;ns Jakob Berzelius</a>, considered one of the fathers of modern chemistry, received his doctorate in medicine in Uppsala in 1804, but later moved to Stockholm.
The less than happy experiences of the Uppsala student life of novelist and playwright <a>August Strindberg</a> (1849&#x2013;1912), resulted in his <em>Fr&#x00e5;n Fj&#x00e4;rdingen och Svartb&#x00e4;cken</em> (1877), a collection of short stories set in Uppsala (&quot;From Fj&#x00e4;rdingen and Svartb&#x00e4;cken&quot;, the title refers to two districts in Uppsala).
<h2>Uppsala University in fiction and popular culture</h2>
Specifically, Uppsala University has appeared notably in <em>M&#x00e4;n som hatar kvinnor</em> or <em>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</em> by Steig Larsson.</p>
The song, originally written in German, lasted 14 weeks in the German charts.
