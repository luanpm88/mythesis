Later that year, the university welcomed its first class of 24 students.
Among these are student housing; food service; health, wellness and counseling; activities, organizations and leadership development; recreation and intramurals.
120 promising minority students from Ohio's nine largest urban public school districts are selected prior to entering high school.
There are over 1,000 registered student organizations that involve many thousands of students.
All of these programs have the ultimate goal of making students better leaders, people, and citizens of Ohio.</p>
