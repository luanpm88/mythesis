Meany and his colleague, Dean Herbert T. Condon, dubbed each of the columns &quot;Loyalty,&quot; &quot;Industry,&quot; &quot;Faith&quot; and &quot;Efficiency,&quot; or &quot;LIFE.&quot;
The plan for the A-Y-P Exposition prepared by <a>John Charles Olmsted</a> was later incorporated into the overall campus master plan and permanently affected the layout of the campus.</p>
The main campus is bounded on the west by 15th Avenue N.E., on the north by N.E.
Although it is rarely used today, the observatory is the second oldest building on campus.
<p>After the exposition, the Board of Regents sought a master plan that would unite the newly developed lower campus with the original buildings of the upper campus including Denny Hall.
This axis joins the lower campus axis laid down during the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition at an open space left behind after a large temporary structure built for the fair was torn down.
Some of the buildings from the exposition were kept by the university and have been retrofitted over the years since.
