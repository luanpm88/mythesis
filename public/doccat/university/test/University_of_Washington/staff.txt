Not to be mistaken for <a>Washington State University</a>, <a>Washington University in St. Louis</a>, or <a>George Washington University</a></em> </p>
<p>The <strong>University of Washington</strong> (<strong>UW</strong>, commonly called <strong>U-Dub</strong>) is a public research <a>university</a>, founded in 1861 in <a>Seattle, Washington</a>, <a>United States</a>.
The university has three campuses, with its largest campus in the <a>University District</a>, <a>Seattle</a> and two other campuses <a>Tacoma</a> and <a>Bothell</a>.
Its operating budget for fiscal year 2005 was $3.1 billion.
UW is considered a <a>Public Ivy</a> institution.</p>
In 1854, territorial governor <a>Isaac Stevens</a> recommended the establishment of a university in <a>Washington</a>.
<p><a>left|thumb|The original University building on Denny's Knoll, c. 1870</a> In 1861, scouting began for an appropriate  site in Seattle to serve as the campus for a new university.
Denny, along with fellow pioneers <a>Edward Lander</a> and <a>Charlie Terry</a>, donated a site on &quot;Denny's Knoll&quot; in <a>downtown Seattle</a>.
However, <a>Clara Antoinette McCarty Wilt</a> became the first graduate of UW in 1876 when she graduated from UW with a <a>bachelor's degree</a> in science.
A special legislative committee headed by UW graduate <a>Edmond Meany</a> was created for the purpose of finding a new campus better able to serve the growing student population.
The committee selected a site on <a>Union Bay</a> northeast of <a>downtown</a>, and the legislature appropriated funds for its purchase and subsequent construction.</p>
In the heart of the city, it is among the most valuable pieces of <a>real estate</a> in Seattle and generates millions of <a>dollars</a> in revenue annually.</p>
[[Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition]]'s lower campus axis toward <a>Mount Rainier</a>]] Organizers of the 1909 <a>Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition</a> eyed the still largely undeveloped campus as a prime setting for their <a>world's fair</a>.
This included a detailed site plan and several buildings.
Construction of the <a>liberal arts</a> <a>quadrangle</a>, known to students as &quot;The Quad,&quot; began in 1916 and continued in stages until 1939.
Further growth came with the end of <a>World War II</a> and passage of the <a>G.I.
Bill</a>.
It would eventually grow into the <a>University of Washington Medical Center</a>, now ranked by <em><a>U.S. News and World Report</a></em> among the top ten hospitals in the <a>United States</a>.
As was the case at many American universities, this era was marked by high levels of <a>student activism</a>, with much of the unrest focused around opposition to the <a>Vietnam War</a>.
<p>The University opened campuses in <a>Bothell</a> and <a>Tacoma</a> in 1990.
Initially, these campuses offered curricula for students seeking <a>bachelor's degree</a>s who have already completed two years of higher education, but both schools have transitioned to four year universities, accepting the first freshman class in the fall of 2006.
Both campuses offer <a>master's degree</a> programs as well.</p>
Its most popular views are from <a>Suzzallo Library</a>, which has a vista of <a>Mount Rainier</a> to the southeast, the Quad and its <a>Yoshino cherry trees</a> that <a>bloom</a> spectacularly each spring to the north, and <a>Red Square</a> spreading out in front of it to the west.

South Campus occupies the land between Pacific Street and the <a>Lake Washington Ship Canal</a> which used to be a <a>golf course</a> and is given over to the <a>health sciences</a>, <a>oceanography</a>, <a>fisheries</a>, and the <a>University of Washington Medical Center</a>.
Built of <a>Tenino</a> <a>sandstone</a> in 1895, it is in the <a>French Renaissance</a> style and named in honor of Seattle pioneers <a>Arthur A.</a> and <a>Mary Denny</a>.
Early plans, including a preliminary proposal by <a>John Charles Olmsted</a>, stepson of renowned <a>landscape architect</a> <a>Frederick Law Olmsted</a>, had little impact.</p>
Library]] looking east across <a>Red Square</a>]] Instead, it was the <a>Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition</a> that defined much of the campus' future layout.
Most of the University's <a>science</a> and <a>engineering</a> buildings line this axis.</p>
Rejecting a further proposal from Olmsted, the regents instead turned to local architects <a>Carl F. Gould</a> and <a>Charles H. Bebb</a>.
Business facilities on the upper campus, science and engineering structures on lower campus, and a new wing of Suzzallo Library, were all built in a <a>modernist</a> style, as was a unique, glass-walled building housing an experimental <a>nuclear reactor</a>.
The reactor opened in 1961; a small <a>radiation</a> leak in 1972 resulted only in a temporary shutdown, but security concerns eventually led to it being decommissioned.
Significant funding came from <a>Microsoft</a> co-founders <a>Paul Allen</a> and <a>Bill Gates</a>, who have strong family connections to the university but did not attend UW. <a>Mary Gates Hall</a> opened in May 2000, and in September 2003, the UW law school relocated to the $74 million <a>William H. Gates</a> Hall on the northwest corner of campus, and the $90 million <a>UW Medical Center</a> surgery pavilion opened for operation.
In March 2006, the $150 million <a>William H. Foege</a> <a>bioengineering</a> and genome sciences building was dedicated by <a>Bill Gates</a> and former U.S. president <a>Jimmy Carter</a>.</p>
<p>Other attractions on campus include the <a>Henry Art Gallery</a> and the <a>Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture</a>.
<p>Several major motion picture films were filmed on campus or used it as a backdrop, including <a>The Sixth Man</a>, <a>WarGames</a>, and <a>What the Bleep!?: Down the Rabbit Hole</a>.</p>
Its most notable current regent is likely <a>William H. Gates, Sr.</a>, father of <a>Bill Gates</a>.
<p>The University offers <a>bachelor's</a>, <a>master's</a> and <a>doctoral</a> degrees through its 140 departments, themselves organized into various colleges and schools: </p>
<p>Among the faculty, there are five winners of <a>Albert Lasker Award for Clinical Medical Research</a>, one winner of the <a>Fields Medal</a>, eight winners of <a>Gairdner International Awards</a>, twelve <a>MacArthur Fellows</a>, two winners of the <a>National Book Award</a>, one winner of the <a>National Medal of Arts</a>, five winners of the <a>National Medal of Science</a>, six <a>Nobel Prize</a> laureates, nineteen winners of the <a>Presidential Early Career Awards in Science and Engineering</a>, and two <a>Pulitzer Prize</a> winners.
Additionally, among UW faculty are fifty-eight members of the <a>American Academy for Arts and Sciences</a>, four members of the <a>American Philosophical Society</a>, thirteen <a>Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigators</a>, forty-eight members of the <a>Institute of Medicine</a>, fifteen members of the <a>National Academy of Engineering</a>, and sixty members of the <a>National Academy of Sciences</a>.</p>
<p>To promote equal academic opportunity, especially for people of low income, UW launched <em>Husky Promise</em> in 2006.
<p>Since 1977, there has been a <a>Transition School and Early Entrance Program</a> on campus.
This Robinson Center also has a program called the UW <a>Academy for Young Scholars</a>: &quot;The UW Academy is the premier early university entrance program for high school students in Washington State.
<p>A private review by the <a>National Opinion Research Center</a>, and published in the <a>Washington Monthly</a>, ranked the university 14th in the United States for 2006.</p>
It was a finalist for the 2009 Pacemaker Newspaper of the Year, and earned second place for Best of Show at the National College Media Conference held in Austin, Texas.</p>
(It should be noted that the traditional bounds of the <a>Montlake neighborhood</a> do <em>not</em> extend north of the <a>Montlake Cut</a> to include the campus.)
The school colors of <a>purple</a> and <a>gold</a> were adopted in 1892 by student vote.
<p>The sports teams participate in the <a>National Collegiate Athletic Association</a>'s Division I-A and in the <a>Pacific-10 Conference</a>.
The <a>golf</a> team plays at the Washington National Golf Club and the <a>swimming</a> team calls the <a>Weyerhaeuser</a> Aquatic Center and the Husky pool home.</p>
<p>The <a>University football team</a> is traditionally competitive, having won four national titles in 1960, 1985, 1990 and 1991, to go along with eight <a>Rose Bowl</a> victories and an <a>Orange Bowl</a> title.
From 1907 to 1917, Washington football teams were unbeaten in 63 consecutive games, an <a>NCAA</a> record.
<a>Tailgating</a> by boat has been a Husky Stadium tradition since 1920 when the stadium was first built on the shores of <a>Lake Washington</a>.
With Romar as head coach, the team went to 5 <a>NCAA tournaments</a> (2003-2004 season, 2004-2005 season, 2005-2006 season, 2008&#x2013;2009 and 2009-2010 season),2 consecutive top 16 (sweet sixteen) appearances, and secured a #1 seed in 2005.
The Washington men's crew gained international prominence by winning the <a>gold medal</a> at the <a>1936 Summer Olympics</a> in <a>Berlin</a>, defeating the <a>German</a> and <a>Italian</a> crews much to the chagrin of <a>Adolf Hitler</a> who was in attendance.
In 1958, the men's crew furthered their lore with a shocking win over <a>Leningrad</a> <a>Trud</a>'s world champion rowers in <a>Moscow</a>, resulting in the first <a>American</a> sporting victory on <a>Soviet</a> soil, and certainly the first time a <a>Russia</a>n crowd gave any American team a standing ovation during the <a>Cold War</a>.
<p>Recent national champions include the <a>softball</a> team (<a>2009</a>), the men's rowing team (2009, 2007), NCAA Division I women's <a>cross country</a> team (2008), and the women's <a>volleyball</a> team (<a>2005</a>).
Individually, <a>James Lepp</a> was the 2005 NCAA men's <a>golf</a> champion.
<p>Several drawings by <a>Populous</a> (formerly HOK Sport) have been released depicting what the future Husky Stadium might look like.</p>
<h2>Services for students</h2>
<p>Construction on <a>Paccar Hall</a> began with a groundbreaking ceremony on Aug 26, 2008.
Completed in 2010, the building acts as a convergence zone for business leaders, alumni, faculty and students.
This project will be subdivided into a Research Lab and Ultra Sensitive Ground Contact Lab, each with support space.
A second phase is anticipated for future growth for a total of approximately 160,000 gross square feet for both Phase 1 and 2. The initial phase for design of the building must consider ground contact and basement levels to provide instrumentation labs with ultra low vibration and electromagnetic interference, as well as above-ground preparatory laboratories and flexible Molecular Engineering research and teaching laboratories.
Like many college bands, the Husky band has several traditional songs that it has played for decades, including the official <a>fight song</a> &quot;<a>Bow Down to Washington</a>&quot; and &quot;<a>Tequila</a>&quot;, as well as fan-favorite &quot;<a>Africano</a>&quot;.
In addition to athletic events, the band also plays at various other events such as <a>commencement</a> and <a>convocation</a>.</p>
<p>Originally the dogs were cared for by the <a>Sigma Alpha Epsilon</a> fraternity, followed by a 49 year tradition (1959&#x2013;2008) of care by the Cross family (a UW professor followed by his son).</p>
All new state-funded buildings and major renovations must meet a <a>LEED</a> standard of at least Silver.
