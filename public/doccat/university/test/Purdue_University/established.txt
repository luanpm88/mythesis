The school is also one of the only institutions in the country that offers <a>AAAE</a> certification for the management of airports.
Clifford Turpin, from the class of 1908, was the first Purdue graduate to become an aviator, and received flight instruction from <a>Orville Wright</a>.
<p>In 1930 Purdue became the first university in the country to offer college credit for flight training, and later became the first university to open its own airport, the <a>Purdue University Airport</a>.
<p>Over the past ten years, Purdue&#x2019;s School of Aeronautics and Astronautics has awarded more aerospace engineering degrees than any other institution in the country, issuing 6% of all undergraduate degrees and 7% of all Ph.D. degrees.
These alumni have led significant advances in research and development of aerospace technology, headed major corporations and government agencies, and have established an amazing record for exploration of space.
Also near the Purdue Mall is Felix Haas Hall, which was constructed in 1909 as Memorial Gymnasium in memory of the 17 Purdue University football players, coaches, alumni, and fans who perished in the <a>Purdue Wreck</a> railroad accident on October 31, 1903.
In 2006, it was renamed in honor of retired Provost Felix Haas and began to also house the Statistics department.</p>
Construction began in 1871, when the building was known as &quot;The Main Building&quot;.
The building was dedicated in 1877 and the project cost $35,000 to complete.
University Hall originally housed the office of the president, a chapel, and classrooms, but was remodeled in 1961 to house only the department of history and classrooms used by the School of Liberal Arts.
According to folklore, at the request of <a>John Purdue</a>, he was buried in the Memorial Mall, directly across from the main entrance of University Hall.
Purdue's Recreational Sports Center, built in 1957, is the first building in the nation created solely to serve university student recreational needs.
This area also includes the <a>Slayter Center of Performing Arts</a> and Cary Quadrangle, one of the largest all-male housing units in the country.
These two academic units retained their &quot;school&quot; status during a university-wide renaming policy in 2004 and 2005 in deference to national <a>professional school</a> naming conventions.
<p>The original faculty of six in 1874 has grown to 2,563 tenured and tenure-track faculty in the Purdue Statewide System by Fall 2007 totals.
Purdue employs 892 non-tenure-track faculty, Lecturers, and Postdoctorals at its West Lafayette campus.
Purdue also was rated the nation's fourth best place to work in academia, according to rankings released in November 2007 by <em><a>The Scientist</a></em> magazine.
Purdue University's nanotechnology research program, built around the new Birck Nanotechnology Center in Discovery Park, ranks among the best in the nation.</p>
<p>The Board of Trustees directly appoints other major officers of the university including a <a>provost</a>, who serves as the chief academic officer for the university, a number of vice presidents with oversight over specific university operations, and the satellite campus chancellors.</p>
The school is also in the process of developing an arboretum on campus.
The cooperative system claims that it allows for a much lower cost of living than other types of housing, as the members take an active role in sharing chores and cooking all meals themselves, as opposed to hiring out cleaning and cooking staff.</p>
<p>The &quot;Movie Tribute Show with Erik Mygrant&quot; was created in a small television studio (now known as the Erik Mygrant Studio) on campus in 1999.</p>
W9YB also holds the self declared title of having one of the largest and most active collegiate <a>amateur radio</a> stations in the country.
<p>Purdue University adopted its school colors, <a>Old Gold</a> and Black, in the fall of 1887.

Armstrong]]]] Purdue alumni has achieved strong recognition in a wide range of areas, but particularly in science and industry.
These individuals have led significant advances in research and development of aerospace technology and established an amazing record for exploration of space.</p>
In 2010, Bloomberg also revealed that Purdue was one of the universities in America with the most undergraduate alumni serving as chief executive officers of Standard &amp; Poor's 500 firms.
