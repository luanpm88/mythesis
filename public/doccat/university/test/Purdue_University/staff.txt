<p><strong>Purdue University</strong>, located in <a>West Lafayette</a>, <a>Indiana</a>, <a>U.S.</a>, is the <a>flagship university</a> of the six-campus <a>Purdue University System</a>.
Purdue was founded on May 6, 1869, as a <a>land-grant university</a> when the <a>Indiana General Assembly</a>, taking advantage of the <a>Morrill Act</a>, accepted a donation of land and money from <a>Lafayette</a> businessman <a>John Purdue</a> to establish a college of science, technology, and agriculture in his name.
<p>Purdue offers both <a>undergraduate</a> and <a>graduate</a> programs in over 210 <a>major</a> areas of study.
The university has been highly influential in America's <a>history of aviation</a>, and Purdue's <a>aviation</a> <a>technology</a> and <a>aeronautical engineering</a> programs remain among the highest rated and most competitive in the world.
Purdue established the first <a>college credit</a> offered in <a>flight training</a>, the first four-year <a>bachelor's degree</a> in <a>aviation</a>, and the first university <a>airport</a> (<a>Purdue University Airport</a>).
Twenty-two Purdue graduates have gone on to become <a>astronaut</a>s, including <a>Gus Grissom</a> (one of the original <a>Mercury Seven</a> astronauts), <a>Neil Armstrong</a> (the first person to walk on the moon), and <a>Eugene Cernan</a> (the last person to walk on the moon).</p>

In 1865, the <a>Indiana General Assembly</a> took advantage of the <a>Morrill Act</a>, and began plans to establish an institution with a strong focus on engineering.
<a>John Purdue</a>, a Lafayette business leader and <a>philanthropist</a> (buried at Purdue), sought to help establish a &quot;land grant&quot; college in Indiana.
Purdue's Aviation Technology Department is also actively involved and partners regularly with <a>National Business Aviation Association</a> and the <a>International Society of Transport Aircraft Trading</a> on a multitude of research projects.</p>
<p>In 2010, Purdue University received a $1.35 million grant from the <a>United States Air Force</a> to develop alternative fuels and test aircraft engines at a new facility.
Purdue also purchased sixteen <a>Cirrus SR-20</a> training aircraft, one <a>Embraer Phenom 100</a> very light jet, and a <a>Bombardier CRJ 700</a> simulator for their exclusive flight training program which only accepts 60 people per year.</p>
Famed aviator <a>Amelia Earhart</a> came to Purdue in 1935 and served as a &quot;Counselor on Careers for Women,&quot; a staff position she held until her disappearance in 1937.
Purdue played a meaningful role in Earhart's ill-fated &quot;Flying Laboratory&quot; project, providing funds for the <a>Lockheed Model 10 Electra</a> aircraft she intended to fly around the world.
<p>At one point, Purdue University owned and operated a <a>charter airline</a> operation under <a>FAR</a> part 121 simply called &quot;Purdue Airlines&quot;.
In fact, <a>Hugh Hefner</a>'s famous <a>Playboy</a> <a>DC-9</a> aircraft was leased from Purdue, and its permanent storage was at Purdue University.</p>
East of the Memorial Mall is the <a>Purdue Memorial Union</a>, Purdue's <a>student union</a> building, and the adjacent Union Club Hotel.</p>
