Sussex is also a founder member of the <a>1994 Group</a> of research-intensive universities.</p>
<p>Sussex quickly came to be identified with postwar social change and developed a reputation for <a>radicalism</a> which it retains.

The plans also include reductions in funding and reorganising of many of the university's non-academic services, including severe cuts to student advice services, sexual health clinic UNISEX, and the on-campus nursery and creche.
<p>Alongside the UCU action, the student body formed a &quot;Stop The Cuts&quot; activism movement, which supported the official UCU strike action with picket lines and vocal peaceful protests outside management buildings, as well as sit-in protests of campus facilities.
On 3 March 2010, citing &quot;management's refusal to consider alternative proposals put by the UCU, student advisors, and the cr&#x00e8;che&quot; a group of approximately 50 students from the Stop The Cuts movement barricaded themselves inside the University's main administrative building after breaking in through a fire exit.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.thebadgeronline.co.uk/news/university-calls-police-on-students-who-protest-outside-sussex-house-against-university-cuts/</a>&lt;/ref&gt;
The protest ended uneventfully after several hours, though two students were arrested and later released over assault on a security guard and a police officer, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/sussex/8548529.stm</a>&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;houses&quot;, of which all but Kent House were based on a courtyard design, featured several long corridors with kitchens and bathrooms at the end and a social space on the ground floor, very much in the manner of a traditional hall of residence.
Park Village, by contrast, consists of individual houses with four bedrooms per floor, a kitchen on both the bottom and the top floor, and bathroom facilities on the middle floor.
The houses are arranged in &quot;streets&quot; with a social centre building including porters' office, pigeon-holes for post, and a bar, towards the campus end of the area.
This development also has a social building with a porters' office and bar.</p>
