<p><a>thumb|The Arts Building on the University of Sussex campus.</a>
The <em>University of Sussex</em> initially began as an idea for the construction of a university to serve <a>Brighton</a>.
In December 1911 there was a public meeting at the <a>Royal Pavilion</a> in order to discover ways in which to fund the construction of a university.
However, the project was halted by the <a>First World War</a> and the money raised was instead used for books for the <a>Municipal Technical College</a>.
However, the idea was revived in the 1950s, and in June 1958, the government approved the corporation's scheme for a university at <a>Brighton</a>, the first of a new generation of <a>red brick universities</a> which came to be known as <a>plate glass universities</a>.&lt;ref
name=&quot;history &quot;/&gt; The University was established as a company in 1959, with a <a>Royal Charter</a> being granted on 16 August 1961.&lt;ref
name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt; The University's organisation broke new ground in seeing the campus divided into Schools of Study, with students able to benefit from a multidisciplinary teaching environment.</p>
In 1973, a crowd of 500 students forcibly prevented United States government adviser Samuel Huntington from giving a speech on campus due to his involvement in the <a>Vietnam War</a>.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.thebadgeronline.co.uk/news/huntingtondie</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>In 2004 the University started to use a new logo in place of its traditional <a>coat of arms</a>, as part of a wider new 'visual identity'.&lt;ref

The campus, designed by Sir <a>Basil Spence</a>, is located in the village of <a>Falmer</a>, next to its railway station, and accessed by car from the <a>A27 road</a>.
The <a>gatehouse</a>-inspired Falmer House won a <a>bronze medal</a> from the <a>Royal Institute of British Architects</a>.&lt;ref
name=&quot;South Downs&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the <a>South Downs National Park</a> replaced the <a>Sussex Downs AONB</a> in March 2010, most of the campus was excluded from the park.</p>
<p>The Gardner Arts Centre, another of Basil Spence's designs, was opened in 1969 as the first university campus arts centre.&lt;ref
name=&quot;Gardner&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It had a 480 seat purpose built theatre, a visual art gallery and studio space and was regularly used for theatre and dance as well as showing a range of films on a modern cinema screen.
The Centre closed in the summer of 2007:&lt;ref name=&quot;Closure&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; withdrawal of funding and the cost of renovating the building were given as the key reasons.</p>
<p>Plans have been put forward to the local council to refurbish the centre, with work starting as soon as mid 2009.
<p>The university was founded with the unusual structure of &quot;Schools of Study&quot; (ubiquitously abbreviated to &quot;schools&quot;) rather than traditional university departments within arts and science faculties.
<p>In the early 1990s, the University promoted the system by claiming, &quot;Clusters of faculty [come] together within schools to pursue new areas of intellectual enquiry.
University of Sussex (1990, 1991).
<em>The University of Sussex Undergraduate Prospectus 1991</em> &lt;/ref&gt; By this time, the original schools had been developed somewhat and were:</p>
<p>In 2001, as the university was celebrating its 40th anniversary, the then Vice Chancellor Alasdair Smith proposed &lt;ref&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; major changes to the curriculum across the 'Arts schools', and structural changes were agreed by the senate which would create two Arts schools and a &quot;Sussex Institute&quot; in place of the five schools then in place.
Corresponding changes would be made in Sciences.</p>
After discussion in senate and the schools, the university adopted for the first time in its history the concept of a department.
All subjects were located firmly in one school, and undergraduates were offered straightforward degree subjects rather than the distinctive Sussex differentiation based on the context provided by school courses.</p>
The term &quot;Schools of Studies&quot; was retained, but each was headed by a &quot;Head of School&quot; rather than the traditional &quot;Dean&quot;.

<p>In 2009, despite an annual turnover of &#x00a3;160 million, the University announced that it had to make cuts of &#x00a3;3 million in the current academic year and &#x00a3;5 million in 2010-11 due to reductions in government funding.
The proposal for the cuts includes 115 compulsory redundancies, including a third of the academics in the School of Life Sciences, 13 academics in Informatics, and more redundancies in the schools of Engineering, History, English and the Centre for Continuing Education.
The necessity of the cuts have been widely criticised, particularly while they run parallel to the University's &#x00a3;100m investment plan for new academic and residential campus buildings.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.sussex.ac.uk/press_office/bulletin/22may09/article6.shtml</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
On 18 March 2010, the <a>University and College Union</a> (UCU) staged a one-day staff strike, urging management to consider alternative cost-cutting proposals,&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/sussex/8574448.stm</a>&lt;/ref&gt; as well as separate protests by parents displeased with the proposed closure of the University's nursery and cr&#x00e8;che facilities.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.ucu.org.uk/index.cfm?articleid=4498</a>&lt;/ref&gt;
The UCU planned further industrial action on 19 and 21 June 2010, but cancelled these actions citing &quot;significant progress&quot; in reaching negotiated settlement for the voluntary departure of staff.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.ucu.org.uk/index.cfm?articleid=4701</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
Six students were later suspended from the University over the protest, though reinstated after paying fines.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/sussex/8556772.stm</a>&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://defendsussex.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/outcome-of-student-disciplinary-hearing.pdf</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>A group of approximately 500 Sussex students were involved in the <a>Fund Our Future: Stop Education Cuts</a> London demonstration on 10th November 2010, which was organised to protest the government's rise of the tuition fee cap.
The University of Sussex's Students Union subsequently issued a statement refusing to condemn the use of violence by a minority of students who occupied the Conservative Party Headquarters during the protest, claiming it was &quot;a drop in the ocean compared to the true violence and vandalism [by the government]&quot;.
The occupation resulted in dozens of injuries (including three police officers) and criminal damage to the building, including smashed windows and spraypaint graffiti.</p>
