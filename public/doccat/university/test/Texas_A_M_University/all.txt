calendar$$$@@@%%%On the top, the words Texas A&amp;M University 1876 encircle an eagle atop a shield over the numbers 0 and 4. The left side contains a large star and an oak.
nickname$$$@@@%%%The right shows a cannon, saber, and rifle with the crossed flags of the United States and Texas.</a>
established$$$@@@%%%The Texas A&amp;M culture is a product of the university's founding as a rural military and agricultural school.
established$$$@@@%%%Although the school and surrounding community have grown, and military training is no longer required, the <a>school's history</a> has instilled in students &quot;the idealized elements of a small-town life: community, tradition, loyalty, optimism, and unabashed sentimentality.&quot;
staff$$$@@@%%%<em><a>Texas Monthly</a></em> posits that Texas A&amp;M students' respect for school <a>traditions</a> and values is the university's greatest strength.
established$$$@@@%%%Some of the school traditions date to the 1890s, while others have been introduced more recently.
calendar$$$@@@%%%These traditions help current and former students to cultivate the Aggie Spirit, a sense of loyalty and respect for the school.
established$$$@@@%%%They dictate many aspects of student life, including how to greet others (using the official school greeting &quot;Howdy!&quot;),
established$$$@@@%%%how to act at an A&amp;M sporting event, and, in many cases, what words a student may use in conversation.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The most visible tradition among seniors and former students is the wearing of the <a>Aggie Ring</a>, whose design has been relatively unchanged since its introduction in 1894.
free_label$$$@@@%%%Students may order a ring after completing 90 <a>credit hours</a> of coursework, including at least 45 hours at A&amp;M, or after graduation.
calendar$$$@@@%%%Graduate students may receive a ring after 75% of their graduate coursework is completed or after the acceptance of their dissertation or thesis.
calendar$$$@@@%%%Though unsanctioned by the University, many students &quot;dunk&quot; their newly acquired Aggie Rings into a pitcher of beer and quickly chug the entire pitcher to &quot;earn&quot; the ring.
postgrad$$$@@@%%%Some students dunk their rings in alternative substances, including ice cream or nonalcoholic beverages.</p>

calendar$$$@@@%%%In keeping with the idea that all current and former students comprise a family, Aggies have created two traditions to honor members of the Aggie family who have died.
calendar$$$@@@%%%<a>Aggie Muster</a> is held annually on the anniversary of the <a>Battle of San Jacinto</a>, April 21, to honor any current and former student who died during the previous year.
nickname$$$@@@%%%Over 300 Musters are held around the world, with the largest taking place at <a>Reed Arena</a> on the <a>Texas A&amp;M University campus</a>.
calendar$$$@@@%%%All Muster ceremonies feature the Roll Call for the Absent.
nickname$$$@@@%%%As the names of the deceased Aggies are called, a family member or friend answers &quot;Here&quot; and lights a candle, to symbolize that although their loved one is not present in body, his or her spirit will shine forever.
staff$$$@@@%%%The event received worldwide attention during <a>World War II</a>, when 25 Aggies &quot;mustered&quot; during the <a>battle</a> for the island of <a>Corregidor</a>.</p>
calendar$$$@@@%%%<p>Students who die while enrolled at Texas A&amp;M are also honored at Silver Taps, a ceremony held, when necessary, on the first Tuesday of the month.
staff$$$@@@%%%This tradition began as a memorial for former Texas A&amp;M president <a>Lawrence Sullivan Ross</a>.
calendar$$$@@@%%%On the day of the ceremony, flags fly half-staff and notices are posted throughout campus.
postgrad$$$@@@%%%At 10:15 p.m. the lights around campus are extinguished and hymns chime from Albritton Tower while students and faculty collect in the Academic Plaza.

mottoeng$$$@@@%%%The song is not played to the east symbolizing that the sun will never rise on that Aggie again.

staff$$$@@@%%%King Gill</a>, a reserve who had left football after the regular season to play basketball.
mottoeng$$$@@@%%%Although he did not actually play, his readiness symbolized the willingness of all Aggies to support their team to the point of actually entering the game.
calendar$$$@@@%%%A&amp;M won 22&#x2013;14, but E. King Gill was the only man left standing on the sidelines for the Aggies.
calendar$$$@@@%%%In recent decades, the 12th Man is represented on the field by a <a>walk-on</a> player who wears the No. 12 jersey and participates in kick-offs.</p>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>The 12th Man uses a variety of school yells, rather than cheers, to support Aggie teams.
mottoeng$$$@@@%%%Each year the student body elects five students to serve as the Yell Leaders.
free_label$$$@@@%%%At <a>midnight</a> before each home <a>football</a> game at Kyle Field or at a predesignated location at away games, the fans gather together to practice the yells for the next day's game.
staff$$$@@@%%%<em><a>Sports Illustrated</a></em> named Midnight Yell as one of the &quot;100 Things You Gotta Do Before You Graduate.&quot;</p>

website$$$@@@%%%<p>Almost every year since 1909, A&amp;M students have built a large bonfire to celebrate their &quot;burning desire to beat the hell outta&quot; the University of Texas.
staff$$$@@@%%%<a>Aggie Bonfire</a> was traditionally lit around <a>Thanksgiving</a> in conjunction with the festivities surrounding the annual <a>college football</a> game between the schools.
