<p><strong>William Marsh Rice University</strong> (commonly known as <strong>Rice University</strong>) opened in 1912 as <strong>The William Marsh Rice Institute for the Advancement of Letters, Science and Art</strong> is a <a>private</a> <a>coeducational</a> research university located in <a>Houston</a>, <a>Texas</a>, <a>United States</a>.
Rice is noted for its <a>applied science</a> programs in the fields of <a>nanotechnology</a>, <a>artificial heart</a> research, structural chemical analysis and space science.
It is listed as one of thirty <a>Hidden Ivies</a> and as one of <a>Newsweek</a>'s &quot;New Ivies.&quot;
Rice's friend and personal lawyer in Houston, <a>James A. Baker, Sr.</a>, aided in the discovery of what turned out to be a fake will with a forged signature.
He came recommended by Princeton's president, <a>Woodrow Wilson</a>.
The <a>residential college</a> system proposed by President Lovett was adopted in 1958, with the East Hall residence becoming <a>Baker College</a>, South Hall residence becoming <a>Will Rice College</a>, West Hall becoming <a>Hanszen College</a>, and the temporary Wiess Hall becoming <a>Wiess College</a>.</p>
Rice acted as a temporary intermediary in the transfer of land between Humble Oil and Refining Company and <a>NASA</a>, for the creation of <a>NASA</a>'s Manned Space Flight Center (now called <a>Johnson Space Center</a>) in 1962.
Rice began charging tuition for the first time in 1965.
In the same year, Rice launched a $33 million ($ million) development campaign.
In 1974, two new schools were founded at Rice, the <a>Jesse H. Jones Graduate School of Management</a> and the <a>Shepherd School of Music</a>.
<p>On-campus housing was exclusively for men for the first forty years.
<a>Jones College</a> was the first women's residence on the Rice campus, followed by <a>Brown College</a>.
By then, several new residential colleges had been built on campus to handle the university's growth, including <a>Lovett College</a>, <a>Sid Richardson College</a>, and <a>Martel College</a>.</p>
In 1993, the <a>James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy</a> was created.
In 1997, the Edyth Bates Old Grand Organ and Recital Hall and the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology, renamed in 2005 for the late Nobel Prize winner and Rice professor <a>Richard E. Smalley</a>, were dedicated at Rice.
In 1999, the Center for Biological and Environmental Nanotechnology was created.
The <a>Rice Owls baseball</a> team was ranked #1 in the nation for the first time in that year (1999), holding the top spot for eight weeks.
In 2008, President <a>David Leebron</a> issued a ten point plan titled &quot;Vision for the Second Century&quot; outlining plans to increase research funding, strengthen existing programs, and increase collaboration.
The plan has brought about another wave of campus constructions, including the erection the newly renamed <a>Bioscience Research Collaborative</a> building (intended to foster collaboration with the adjacent <a>Texas Medical Center</a>), a new recreational center and renovated <a>basketball stadium</a>, and the addition of two new residential colleges, <a>Duncan College</a> and <a>McMurtry College</a>.

<p>Rice's campus is a heavily-wooded  tract of land located close to the city of <a>West University Place</a>, in the museum district of <a>Houston</a>.
The <a>Lynn R. Lowrey Arboretum</a>, consisting of more than 4000 trees and shrubs (giving birth to the legend that Rice has a tree for every student), is spread throughout the campus.
<p>The university's first president, <a>Edgar Odell Lovett</a>, intended for the campus to have a uniform architecture style to improve its aesthetic appeal.
To that end, nearly every building on campus is noticeably <a>Byzantine</a> in style, with sand and pink-colored bricks, large archways and columns being a common theme among many campus buildings.
Noteworthy exceptions include the glass-walled Brochstein Pavilion, <a>Lovett College</a> with its <a>Brutalist</a>-style concrete gratings, and the eclectic-Mediterranean Duncan Hall.
The Academic Quad, anchored by a statue of founder <a>William Marsh Rice</a>, includes <a>Ralph Adams Cram</a>'s masterpiece, the asymmetrical Lovett Hall, the original administrative building; Fondren Library; Herzstein Hall, the physics building and home to the largest <a>amphitheater</a> on campus; Sewall Hall for the social sciences and arts; Rayzor Hall for the languages; and Anderson Hall of the Architecture department.
Further west lies a quad surrounded by McNair Hall of the <a>Jones Business School</a>, the <a>Baker Institute</a>, and Alice Pratt Brown Hall of the <a>Shepherd School of Music</a>.

Other stadia include the <a>Rice Track/Soccer Stadium</a> and the <a>Jake Hess Tennis Stadium</a>.
<p>The university and <a>Houston Independent School District</a> jointly established <a>The Rice School</a>, a <a>kindergarten</a> through 8th grade public magnet school in Houston.
Through Cy-Fair ISD Rice University offers a credit course based summer school for grades 8 through 12.
<a>David W. Leebron</a> was appointed President in 2004 and succeeded <a>Malcom Gillis</a> who served since 1993.
The President presides over a Faculty Council which has the authority to alter curricular requirements, establish new degree programs, and approve candidates for degrees.
Rice's undergraduate program ranked 17th (tied with <a>Vanderbilt University</a>) among &quot;National Universities&quot; by <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></em> (USNWR) in its 2009 edition and 41st nationally by <em><a>Forbes Magazine</a></em> in 2008.
The <em><a>Princeton Review</a></em> ranked Rice 1st for &quot;Best Quality of Life&quot;, 2nd for &quot;Lots of Race/Class Interaction&quot;, 15th for &quot;Happiest Students&quot;, and 4th for &quot;Best Value&quot; in its 2009 edition.
<p>Rice is noted for its pioneer <a>applied science</a> programs in the fields of <a>nanotechnology</a>, - the nation's first nanotechnology center</li>
<li>Center for Biological and Environmental Nanotechnology (CBEN) - promotes the discovery and development of nanomaterials that enable new medical and environmental technologies</li>
<li>Laboratory for Nanophotonics (LANP) - provides a resource for education and research breakthroughs and advances in the broad, multidisciplinary field of nanophotonics</li>

Rice's campus adjoins <a>Hermann Park</a>, the <a>Texas Medical Center</a>, and a neighborhood commercial center called the <a>Rice Village</a>.
Hermann Park includes the <a>Houston Museum of Natural Science</a>, the <a>Houston Zoo</a>, <a>Miller Outdoor Theatre</a> and an 18-hole municipal golf course.
<a>Reliant Park</a>, home of <a>Reliant Stadium</a> and the <a>Astrodome</a>, is two miles (3&nbsp;km) south of the campus.
The campus recently joined the <a>Zipcar</a> program with two vehicles to increase the transportation options for students and staff that need that currently don't utilize a vehicle.</p>
<p> In 1957, Rice University implemented a <a>residential college</a> system, as proposed by the university's first president, <a>Edgar Odell Lovett</a>.
<p>There are currently eleven residential colleges, with six (<a>Baker</a>, <a>Hanszen</a>, <a>Lovett</a>, <a>Sid Richardson</a>, <a>Wiess</a>, and <a>Will Rice</a>) on the south side of campus and five (<a>Brown</a>, <a>Jones</a>, <a>Martel</a>, <a>Duncan</a>, and <a>McMurtry</a>) on the north.
Students develop strong loyalties to their college and maintain friendly rivalry with other colleges, especially during events such as <a>Beer Bike</a> and <a>O-Week</a>.
Colleges keep their rivalries alive by performing &quot;jacks,&quot; or pranks, on each other, especially during O-Week and <a>Willy Week</a>.
Ten riders and ten chuggers make up a team.
Elaborate rules include details such as a prohibition of &quot;bulky or wet clothing articles designed to absorb beer/water or prevent spilled beer/water from being seen&quot; and regulations for chug can design.
Each residential college as well as the Graduate Student Association participates with a men's team, a women's team, and alumni (co-ed) team.
Each leg of the race is a relay in which a team's &quot;chugger&quot; must chug 24 ounces of beer or water for the men's division and 12 ounces for women before the team's &quot;rider&quot; may begin to ride.

Many of these organizations have been operating for several decades.</p>
It provides the graduate student community and the Rice community as a whole with a family-friendly place to unwind and relax after a long work day, and a comfortable place for graduate students to relax and relate on the woes of graduate research.
<p>Rice has a weekly student-run newspaper (<em><a>The Rice Thresher</a></em>), radio station (<a>KTRU-FM</a>), and campus-wide television network (RTV5).
&lt;!--TO THOSE EDITING THIS SECTION: There have been some &quot;EDIT WARS&quot; in this section of the article, with sections for &quot;Rice Standard&quot; and &quot;Open&quot; being persistently deleted and reinstated.
It is distributed around campus, and at a few other local businesses and has a website on the <a>College Publisher</a> network.
In 2000 and 2006, <a>KTRU</a> won Houston Press' Best Radio Station in Houston.
In the spring of 2005, RBT members decided the station needed a new image and a new name: Rice Television 5.
One such show is held in fall and another in spring, usually during a weekend allocated for visits by prospective students.
A mixture of essays, editorials, stories and artistic photography brought Open attention both on campus and in the <a>Houston Chronicle</a>.
<p> <a>thumb|left|200px|Rice Stadium during an Owls game</a> Rice participates in <a>NCAA</a> <a>Division I</a> athletics and is part of <a>Conference USA</a>.
Rice was a member of the <a>Western Athletic Conference</a> before joining Conference USA in 2005.
Rice is the second-smallest school, measured by undergraduate enrollment, competing in NCAA <a>Division I FBS</a> <a>football</a>, only slightly ahead of <a>Tulsa</a>.</p>
<p>The <a>Rice baseball team</a> won the <a>2003 College World Series</a>, defeating <a>Stanford</a>, giving Rice its only national championship in a team sport.
As of 2010, the baseball team has won 14 consecutive conference championships in three different conferences: the final championship of the defunct <a>Southwest Conference</a>, all nine championships while a member of the <a>Western Athletic Conference</a>, and five more championships in its first five years as a member of <a>Conference USA</a>.
Additionally, Rice's baseball team has finished third in both the <a>2006</a> and <a>2007 College World Series</a> tournaments.
In 2004, Rice became the first school ever to have three players selected in the first eight picks of the <a>MLB draft</a> when <a>Philip Humber</a>, <a>Jeff Niemann</a>, and <a>Wade Townsend</a> were selected third, fourth, and eighth, respectively.
In 2007, <a>Joe Savery</a> was selected as the 19th overall pick.

Rice Stadium also serves as the performance venue for the university's <a>Marching Owl Band</a>, or &quot;MOB.&quot;
Despite its name, the MOB is a <a>scatter band</a> that focuses on performing humorous skits and routines rather than traditional formation marching.</p>
<p><a>Rice Owls men's basketball</a> won 10 conference titles in the former Southwest Conference (1918, 1935*, 1940, 1942*, 1943*, 1944*, 1945, 1949*, 1954*, 1970; * denotes shared title).
Most recently, guard Morris Almond was drafted in the first round of the <a>2007 NBA Draft</a> by the <a>Utah Jazz</a>.
Rice recently named former <a>Cal Bears</a> head coach <a>Ben Braun</a> as head basketball coach to succeed Willis Wilson, fired after Rice finished the 2007-2008 season with a winless (0-16) conference record and overall record of 3-27.</p>
