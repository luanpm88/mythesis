Rice was elected to the <a>Association of American Universities</a> in 1985.
<p>Rice began operation in 1912 as a coeducational institution with free tuition.
The university was founded several years after the murder of its namesake, the prominent Houston businessman <a>William Marsh Rice</a>, who left a $4.6 million ($ million in current dollars) founding endowment in his will.
Rice University is currently ranked 17th among &quot;national universities&quot; in the United States according to the 2010 US News and World Report.</p>
Rice made his fortune in real estate, railroad development and cotton trading in the state of <a>Texas</a>.
On the morning of September 23, 1900, Rice was found dead by his valet, and presumed to have died in his sleep.
Shortly thereafter, a suspiciously large check made out to Rice's New York City lawyer, signed by the late Rice, was noticed by a bank teller due to a misspelling in the recipient's name.
A subsequent investigation led by the District Attorney of New York resulted in the arrests of Patrick and of Rice's butler and valet Charles F. Jones, who had been persuaded to administer chloroform to Rice while he slept.
Patrick was convicted of murder in 1901.
Baker helped Rice's estate direct the fortune, worth $4.6 million in 1904 ($ million today), towards the founding of what was to be called the Rice Institute.
In 1907, the Board of Trustees selected the head of the Department of Mathematics and Astronomy at <a>Princeton University</a>, <a>Edgar Odell Lovett</a>, to head the Institute, which was still in the planning stages.
Lovett was impressed by such things as the aesthetic beauty of the uniformity of the architecture at the <a>University of Pennsylvania</a>, a theme which was adopted by the Institute, as well as the <a>residential college</a> system at <a>Cambridge University</a> in <a>England</a>, which was added to the Institute several decades later.
Lovett called for the establishment of a university &quot;of the highest grade,&quot; &quot;an institution of liberal and technical learning&quot; devoted &quot;quite as much investigation as to instruction.&quot;
<p><a>thumb|An illustration of the Administration Building of Rice University in 1913</a> In 1911, the cornerstone was laid for the Institute's first building, the Administration Building, now known as Lovett Hall in honor of the founding president.
Rice was unusual for the time in that it had coeducational admissions.
Three weeks after opening, a spectacular international academic festival was held in celebration, bringing Rice to the attention of the entire academic world.
The first doctorate was conferred in 1918.</p>
<p>The Founder's Memorial Statue, a bronze statue of a seated William Marsh Rice, holding the original plans for the campus, was dedicated in 1930, and installed in the central academic quad, facing Lovett Hall.
1960 saw Rice Institute formally renamed William Marsh Rice University.
In 1964, Rice officially desegregated its graduate and undergraduate divisions.
$43 million ($ million) was raised by its conclusion in 1970.
The Brown Foundation Challenge, a fund-raising program designed to encourage annual gifts, was launched in 1976 and ended in 1996 having raised $185 million ($ million).
The <a>Rice School of Social Sciences</a> was founded in 1979.</p>
Individual colleges became coeducation between 1973 and 1987, with the single-sex floors of colleges that had them becoming co-ed in 2006.

<p>In 2003, the Owls won their first national championship in baseball, which was the first for the university in any team sport, beating Southwest Missouri State in the opening game and then the University of Texas and Stanford University twice each en route to the title.
<p>Beginning in late 2008, the university considered a merger with <a>Baylor College of Medicine</a>, though the merger was ultimately rejected in 2010.
<p>Five streets demarcate the campus: Greenbriar Street, Rice Boulevard, Sunset Boulevard, Main Street, and University Boulevard.
For most of its history, all of Rice's buildings have been contained within this &quot;outer loop&quot;.
After improvements in 2006, the stadium is currently configured to seat 47,000 for football but can readily be reconfigured to its original capacity of 70,000, more than the total number of Rice alumni, living and deceased.
The school opened in August 1994.
They also have skills based classes during the summer in the Rice Summer School.</p>
The board of trustees delegates its power by appointing a President to serve as the chief executive of the university.
Rice has recently begun to offer minors in areas such as <a>business</a>, energy and water sustainability, and global health.</p>
<p>With an estimated total expenses of $45,638 for the 2009-2010 school year, Rice awarded $34.1 million in financial aid for 2007&#x2013;2008 and 2,139 (71.2%) of undergraduates received some sort of aid.
<p> In 2010 Rice was ranked 47th in the world by the <a>Times Higher Education World University Rankings</a>, 115th in the world by <a>QS World University Rankings</a>, and 99th internationally (54th nationally) by the <a>Academic Ranking of World Universities</a>.
Rice was ranked 26th among national universities by <em><a>The Washington Monthly</a></em> in 2006, and 41st among research universities by the Center for Measuring University Performance in 2007.</p>

During Matriculation, Commencement, and other formal academic ceremonies, the colleges process in the order in which they were established.</p>
Will Rice College first swept in 1983, then again in 1986, then in 1999, and most recently in 2009.
<p>Rice Coffeehouse finds its beginnings in Hanszen College, where students would serve coffee in the Weenie Loft - a study room in the old section's fourth floor.
Due to flooding, an unfortunate effect of 1) its location in the basement and 2) the Houston climate, this coffee house closed.
Demand for an on-campus Coffeehouse grew and in 1990, the Rice Coffeehouse was founded.</p>
Additionally, Valhalla plays a pivotal role in many campus traditions including the Baker 13 and Beer Bike.</p>
<p>It was founded in 1970, but did not get an alcohol license until 1971.
The pub's patrons have expanded beyond graduate students and other members of the local community in recent years, and the pub has become a regular on the annual &quot;Best of Houston&quot; published by the <em><a>Houston Press</a></em>, being named the &quot;Best Place to Meet Single Women&quot; in 2004 due to the frequency of intelligent conversation and smart, single women.</p>
The name was chosen by students in tribute to the university's founder, <a>William Marsh Rice</a>.
After the drinking age in Texas was raised in 1986, the pub entered a period of financial difficulties and in April 1995, was destroyed in a fire.
In addition, Rice hosts several student magazines dedicated to a range of different topics; in fact, the spring semester of 2008 saw the birth of two such magazines, a literary sex journal called <em>Open</em> and an undergraduate science research magazine entitled <em>Catalyst</em>.
The Thresher has a small, dedicated staff and is known for its coverage of campus news, open submission opinion page, and the satirical Backpage, which has often been the center of controversy.
It is known for playing genres and artists of music and sound unavailable on other radio stations in Houston, and often, the US.
RTV5 was created initially as Rice Broadcast Television in 1997; RBT began to broadcast the following year in 1998, and aired its first live show across campus in 1999.
It experienced much growth and exposure over the years with successful programs like &quot;Drinking with Phil,&quot; a weekly news show, and extensive live coverage in December 2000 of the shut down of KTRU by the administration.
In spring 2001, the Rice undergraduate community voted in the general elections to support RBT as a blanket tax organization, effectively providing a yearly income of $10,000 to purchase new equipment and provide the campus with a variety of new programming.
The station has recently set about revitalizing its staff roster and campus image; one of RTV5's most popular shows is the 24 hour show, where a camera and couch placed in the RMC stay on air for 24 hours.
The journal was founded in 2004 by creative writing professor and author <a>Justin Cronin</a>.</p>
<p><em>Open</em>, a magazine dedicated to &quot;literary sex content,&quot; predictably caused a stir on campus with its initial publication in spring 2008.
However, as of spring 2010 UBlue has not been published in four years, and has had its blanket tax allocation revoked.</p>
The victory made Rice University the smallest school in 51 years to win a national championship at the highest collegiate level of the sport.
Tensions remain high between the athletic department and faculty, as a few professors who chose to voice their opinion were in favor of abandoning the football program.
<p>In 2008, the football team posted a 9-3 regular season, capping off the year with a 38-14 victory over Western Michigan University in the Texas Bowl.
<p>Rice has been very successful in women's sports in recent years.
In 2004-05, Rice sent its women's volleyball, soccer, and basketball teams to their respective NCAA tournaments.
In previous decades, the university kept several live owls on campus in front of <a>Lovett College</a>, but this practice has been discontinued.</p>
