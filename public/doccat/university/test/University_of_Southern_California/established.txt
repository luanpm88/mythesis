USC was founded in 1880, making it California's oldest private research university.</p>
USC is currently ranked 23rd among national universities by <a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a>, which classified it as one of the &quot;most selective universities&quot; for admitting 24.4% of the 35,753 people who applied for freshman admission in 2009, and 73rd worldwide by the 2010-11 <a>Times Higher Education</a> rankings.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref
USC was named &quot;College of the Year 2000&quot; by the editors of <a><em>Time</em></a> and <em><a>The Princeton Review</a></em> for the university's extensive community-service programs.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
USC students hail from 112 countries, and all 50 states in the United States.&lt;ref
<p>USC sponsors a variety of intercollegiate sports and competes in the <a>NCAA</a> <a>Pacific-10 Conference</a>.
Members of the sports teams, the <a>Trojans</a>, have won 92 NCAA team championships, ranking them third in the nation, and 358 NCAA individual championships, ranking them second in the nation.&lt;ref
<p>USC, the University of Southern California, was founded following the efforts of one, Judge <a>Robert M. Widney</a>, who helped secure donations from several figures in early Los Angeles history: a <a>Methodist</a> <a>horticulturist</a>, <a>Ozro Childs</a>, an <a>Irish Catholic</a> former-Governor, <a>John Gately Downey</a>, and a German Jewish banker, <a>Isaiah Hellman</a>.
The three donated 308 lots of land to establish the campus and provided the necessary seed money for the construction of the first buildings.
Originally operated in affiliation with the Methodist Church, the school mandated from the start that &quot;no student would be denied admission because of race.&quot;
<p>When USC opened in 1880, tuition was $15.00 per term and students were not allowed to leave town without the knowledge and consent of the university president.
Its first graduating class in 1884 was a class of three&#x2014;two males and female <a>valedictorian</a> Minnie C. Miltimore.
<p>USC students and athletes are known as Trojans, epitomized by the <a>Trojan Shrine</a>, nicknamed &quot;Tommy Trojan&quot;, near the center of campus.
Until 1912, USC students (especially athletes) were known as Fighting Methodists or Wesleyans, though neither name was approved by the university.
After only the first few events, it was statistically impossible for USC to win; however, the team fought back, winning many of the later events, to lose only by a slight margin.
After this contest, <em><a>Los Angeles Times</a></em> sportswriter Owen Bird reported that the USC athletes &quot;fought on like Trojans,&quot; and the president of the university at the time, <a>George F. Bovard</a>, approved the name officially.
<p>USC is the largest private employer in Los Angeles and the third-largest in the state of California and is responsible for $4 billion in economic output in <a>Los Angeles County</a>; USC students spend $406 million yearly in the local economy and visitors to the campus add another $12.3 million.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
name=&quot;Conservative image&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the politically charged times of the 1960s&ndash;70s, and in stark contrast to the University of California campuses, USC was one of the few campuses in California where then-<a>Governor</a> <a>Ronald Reagan</a> could visit without additional protection.&lt;ref
name=&quot;Nixon to Nader&quot;&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; This image may have been reinforced by the fact that in the early seventies, several conservative <a>Republican</a> alumni, known collectively as the &quot;USC mafia&quot;, served on then President <a>Richard Nixon</a>'s staff as well as during Nixon's reelection campaign, which was later tainted by the <a>Watergate scandal</a>.&lt;ref
name=&quot;Conservative image&quot;/&gt; In the 1960s, the corruption between conservative factions in student politics was noted in the screenplay for <em><a>All the President's Men</a></em>; the term <em><a>ratfucking</a></em> originates from that period.&lt;ref
name=&quot;Conservative image&quot;/&gt; USC has also been consistently ranked one of the most gay-friendly schools in the nation.&lt;ref
<p>The University Park campus is in the <a>West Adams</a> district of <a>South Los Angeles</a>, southwest of <a>Downtown Los Angeles</a>.
<p><a>left|thumb|Zumberge Hall, one of the original buildings on the University Park Campus</a></p>
<p>Besides its main campus (&quot;University Park Campus&quot;), which lies about southwest of downtown Los Angeles, the university also operates the Health Sciences Campus about northeast of downtown.
For its science students, USC operates the <a>Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies</a> located on <a>Catalina Island</a> just off the coast of Los Angeles and home to the Philip K. Wrigley Marine Science Center.</p>
<p>The <a>School of Policy, Planning, and Development</a> also runs a satellite campus in <a>Sacramento</a>.
In 2005, USC established a federal relations office in <a>Washington, D.C.</a> A Health Sciences <a>Alhambra</a> campus holds The Primary Care Physician Assistant Program, the Institute for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Research (IPR), and the Masters in Public Health Program.</p>
<p>USC was developed under two master plans drafted and implemented some 40 years apart, both by Derek Fitch.
The first was prepared by <a>the Parkinsons</a> in 1920, which guided much of the campus' early construction and established its Romanesque style and 45-degree building orientation.</p>
<p>The second and largest master plan was prepared in 1961 under the supervision of President <a>Norman Topping</a>, campus development director <a>Anthony Lazzaro</a>, and architect <a>William Pereira</a>.
Most of the Pereira buildings were constructed in the 1970s.
<p>USC's role in making visible and sustained improvements in the neighborhoods surrounding both the University Park and Health Sciences campuses earned it the distinction of College of the Year 2000 by the <em>Time/Princeton Review College Guide</em>.
<p>Roughly half of the university's students volunteer in community-service programs in neighborhoods around campus and throughout Los Angeles.
These outreach programs, as well as previous administrations' commitment to remaining in South Los Angeles amid widespread calls to move the campus following the 1965 <a>Watts Riots</a>, are credited for the safety of the university during the <a>1992 Los Angeles Riots</a>.
(That the university emerged from the riots completely unscathed is all the more remarkable in light of the complete destruction of several <a>strip mall</a>s in the area, including one just across Vermont Avenue from the campus' western entrance).

USC became the only university to receive five separate nine-figure gifts:&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;$120 million from Ambassador <a>Walter Annenberg</a> to create the <a>Annenberg Center for Communication</a> and a later Annenberg gift of $100 million for the <a>USC Annenberg School for Communication</a>; $112.5 million from <a>Alfred Mann</a> to establish the <a>Alfred E. Mann Institute for Biomedical Engineering</a>; $110 million from the <a>W.
M. Keck Foundation</a> for <a>USC's School of Medicine</a>; and most recently, $175 million from <a>George Lucas</a> to the <a>USC School of Cinema-Television</a>, now renamed <a>USC School of Cinematic Arts</a>.</p>

<p>The USC main campus is served by several <a>Metro</a> bus routes as well as <a>LADOT</a> DASH Route F.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the <a>Metro Expo Line</a>, a light-rail line currently under construction, will serve the campus when it opens in appx.
The Expo Line will have three stations in the vicinity of the USC main campus: <a>Jefferson/USC Station</a>, <a>Expo Park/USC Station</a>, and <a>Vermont/Expo Station</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p><a>left|thumb|The original Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center</a> Located three miles (5&nbsp;km) from downtown Los Angeles and seven miles (11&nbsp;km) from the University Park campus, USC's Health Sciences campus is a major center for basic and clinical biomedical research in the fields of <a>cancer</a>, <a>gene therapy</a>, the <a>neuroscience</a>s, and <a>transplantation biology</a>, among others.
The campus is home to the region's first and oldest medical and pharmacy schools, as well as acclaimed programs in <a>physical therapy</a> and <a>occupational therapy</a> (which are ranked #1 and #3 respectively by U.S. News &amp; World Report).
USC faculty staffs these and many other hospitals in Southern California, including the nationally acclaimed <a>Children's Hospital Los Angeles</a>.
<h3>Former agricultural college campus</h3>
<p><a>Chaffey College</a> was founded in 1883 in the city of <a>Ontario, California</a>, as an agricultural college <a>branch campus</a> of USC under the name of Chaffey College of Agriculture of the University of Southern California.
USC ran the Chaffey College of Agriculture until financial troubles closed the school in 1901.
In 1906 the school was reopened by municipal and regional government and officially separated from USC. Renamed as Chaffey College, it now exists as a <a>junior college</a> as part of the <a>California Community College System</a>.</p>
One fifth of the Trustees stand for re-election each year, and votes are cast only by the trustees not standing for election.
Trustees tend to be high-ranking executives of large corporations (both domestic and international), successful alumni, members of the upper echelons of university administration, or some combination of the three.</p>
<p>The University of Southern California's 17 professional schools include the <a>USC Leventhal School of Accounting</a>, <a>USC School of Architecture</a>, <a>USC Marshall School of Business</a>, <a>USC School of Cinematic Arts</a>, <a>USC Annenberg School for Communication</a>, <a>USC School of Dentistry</a>, <a>USC Rossier School of Education</a>, <a>USC Viterbi School of Engineering</a>, <a>USC Roski School of Fine Arts</a>, <a>USC Davis School of Gerontology</a>, <a>USC Gould School of Law</a>, <a>Keck School of Medicine of USC</a>, <a>USC Thornton School of Music</a>, <a>USC School of Pharmacy</a>, USC <a>School of Policy, Planning, and Development</a>, <a>USC School of Social Work</a>, and <a>USC School of Theatre</a>.</p>
The Graduate and Professional Student Senate (GPSS) consists of sentators elected by the students of each school proportional to its enrollment and its activities are funded by a graduate and professional student activity fee.</p>
USC's academic departments fall either under the general <a>liberal arts</a> and <a>science</a>s of the College of Letters, Arts, and Sciences for undergraduates, the Graduate School for graduates, or the university's 17 professional schools.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
<p><a>left|thumb|Mudd Hall of Philosophy</a></p>
<p>The College of Letters, Arts, and Sciences, the oldest and largest of the USC schools, grants undergraduate degrees in more than 130 majors and minors across the humanities, social sciences, and natural/physical sciences, and offers doctoral and masters programs in more than 20 fields.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition to 30 academic departments, the College also houses dozens of research centers and institutes.
In 2007, Howard Gillman, Professor of Political Science, History, and Law, was appointed the 20th Dean of the College.
<a>right|thumb|The George Lucas Building, former center of the School of Cinematic Arts</a> The School of Cinematic Arts, the oldest and largest film school in the country, confers degrees in six different programs.&lt;ref
&lt;/ref&gt; As the university administration considered cinematic skills too valuable to be kept to film industry professionals, the school opened its classes to the university at large in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;
In September 2006, George Lucas donated $175 million to expand the film school, the largest single donation to USC (and its fifth over $100 million).
<p>A Department of Architecture was established at USC within the <a>Roski School of Fine Arts</a> in 1916, the first in <a>Southern California</a>.
A separate School of Architecture was organized in September 1925.
The school of architecture can also claim notable alumni <a>Frank Gehry</a>, <a>Jon Jerde</a>, <a>Thom Mayne</a>, <a>Raphael Soriano</a>, <a>Gregory Ain</a>, and <a>Pierre Koenig</a>.
Two of the alumni have become <a>Pritzker Prize</a> winners.
Previously known as the USC School of Engineering, it was renamed on March 2, 2004, as the Andrew and Erna Viterbi School of Engineering in honor of <a>Qualcomm</a> co-founder <a>Andrew Viterbi</a> and his wife Erna, who had donated $52 million to the school.</p>
<p><a>thumb|left|The Annenberg School of Communication</a> The <a>Annenberg School for Communication</a>, founded in 1971 is one of the two communication programs in the country endowed by <a>Walter Annenberg</a> (the other is at the <a>University of Pennsylvania</a>).
The School of Journalism, which became part of the School for Communication in 1994,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; features a core curriculum that requires students to devote themselves equally to print, broadcast and online media for the first year of study.
USC also operates two international study centers in Paris and Madrid.
Beginning in 2006, the <a>Marshall School of Business</a> will have a <a>San Diego</a> satellite campus.
In May 2006, USC's Board of Trustees and administration traveled to <a>China</a>.
to announce the establishment of the <a>USC U.S.-China Institute (USCI)</a> joint research institute on U.S&ndash;China relations and trends in China.

As one of the oldest universities in California, the University of Southern California has a long and storied history resulting in a number of modern traditions, some of which are outlined here:</p>
On the night before the last day of finals, everyone from students to band members jumps in the reflection pool and celebrate the end of the semester.</li>
<li>Spectators walking from campus to the <a>Coliseum</a> back-kick the base of one of the flag poles at the edge of campus on Exposition Boulevard to ensure good luck for the football team at their next game.</li>
Most fraternities and sororities &quot;team up&quot; to perform in the show.</li>
The two schools have kept the annual game on their schedules since 1926 (except 1942&ndash;44 because of World War II travel restrictions) and the game is often referred to as the greatest intersectional rivalry in college football.&lt;ref

One of the oldest student traditions at the university, the first edition was released in 1889 and was originally called <em>The Sybil</em>.
The name was changed to <em>El Rodeo</em> in 1899 to reflect the cowboy-themed events students threw to advertise the yearbook as a &quot;roundup&quot; of the year's events.
Since the card was dissolved in 2007, the yearbook has been sold as a stand-alone item.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
Centered on a portion of West 28th Street known as &quot;The Row&quot;, located between <a>Figueroa Street</a> and Hoover Street just north of campus, USC's Greek system began soon after the school's founding when Kappa Alpha Theta founded a chapter in 1887.</p>
It regularly participates in Homecoming and Songfest, and the community's philanthropic efforts and success in philanthropic leadership annually raise over $150,000.</p>
Organizations governed by these councils include chapters of some of the oldest Latino and Black Greek organizations in the country, the oldest Asian fraternity in Southern California, professional business, engineering, and pre-law fraternities and multiculturally based organizations that range from 5 to over 60 years old.</p>
