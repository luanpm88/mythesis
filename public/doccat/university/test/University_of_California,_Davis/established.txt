<p>The <strong>University of California, Davis, (UC Davis)</strong> is a <a>public</a> research university located in <a>Davis, California</a>, and one of ten campuses in the <a>University of California</a> system.
Referred locally as <strong>UCD</strong>, the school was originally established in 1905 as the University Farm, an extension of <a>UC Berkeley</a>.
UC Davis welcomed its first class in 1908.
It was later formally established as a UC campus by the <a>Regents of the University of California</a> in 1959.</p>
<p>UC Davis' graduate and professional programs include the <a>UC Davis School of Medicine</a> (which includes the <a>UC Davis Medical Center</a>), the <a>UC Davis School of Law</a>, <a>UC Davis School of Education</a>, <a>UC Davis Graduate Studies</a>, <a>The Betty Irene Moore School of Nursing</a>, and the <a>UC Davis Graduate School of Management</a>.</p>
<p>The <a>UC Davis Aggies</a> compete in the NCAA Division I level primarily in the <a>Big West Conference</a> as well as <a>Great West Conference</a>, <a>Pacific-10 Conference</a>, and <a>Mountain Pacific Sports Federation</a> in other sports.
In its first year of full Division I status, 11 UC Davis teams qualified for NCAA post-season.</p>
Creamery and Horticulture buildings, University Farm]] In 1905, Governor [[George Pardee]] signed into law an act to establish a university farm school for the University of California (at the time, [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] was the sole campus of the University).
It would be more than a year before that commission selected a tiny town, then known as Davisville, as the site.
What was to become the third UC Campus opened its doors to 40 degree students (all male) from UC Berkeley in January 1909 as the &quot;University Farm.&quot;
(The farm had begun accepting non-degree farmers' short courses in October 1908; there were initially around 115 such attendees.)
The establishment of the Farm was largely the result of the vision and perseverance of [[Peter J. Shields]], secretary of the State Agricultural Society, and the namesake of the future Peter J. Shields Library at UC Davis.
[[Image:Petershields.jpg|thumb|right|Peter J. Shields, the &quot;Father of the Farm.&quot;]]
Shields began to champion the cause of a University Farm to teach agriculture in a more applied fashion after hearing about California students who chose to go to out-of-state universities due to the lack of such programs in the University of California at that time.
<p>There was a College of Agriculture at Berkeley in connection with the University of California, but it was purely academic.
It was largely confined to the study of botany and chemistry; it had no farm and little prestige; it was apt to be thought of as a snap curriculum, attracting students who wanted to go to college but wanted to avoid its more difficult work.</p>
<p>After two failed bills, a law authorizing the creation of a University Farm was passed on March 18, 1905, and <a>Yolo County</a>, home to some of California's prime farmland, was chosen as the site.
The Farm accepted its first female students in 1914 from Berkeley.
Renamed in 1922 the <em>Northern Branch of the College of Agriculture</em>, it continued growing at a breakneck pace: in 1916 the Farm's 314 students occupied the original campus, but by 1951 it had already expanded to a size of .
In 1959, the campus was declared by the <a>Regents of the University of California</a> as the seventh general campus in the <a>University of California</a> system.</p>

<p>The University of California, Davis campus is the largest campus in the UC system, spanning over across two counties: <a>Yolo</a> and <a>Solano</a>.
Located west of <a>Sacramento</a> in the <a>Sacramento Valley</a>, part of California's <a>Central Valley</a>, it is adjacent to <a>Interstate Highway 80</a>.
It is also one of only two schools in the University of California system, the other being <a>UC Berkeley</a>, with a <a>nuclear</a> lab.</p>
The northeast side of campus holds more of the core buildings that were built earlier in UC Davis's history, such as Wellman Hall, Shields Library, <a>Mrak Hall</a>, and Hutchison Hall, as well as the North Entry Parking Structure.
Also notable in this northeastern corner is the labyrinthine Social Sciences and Humanities building designed by <a>Antoine Predock</a>, known to students as the &quot;<a>Death Star</a>&quot; for its angular, metallic design.</p>
<p>The northwest end of campus holds the majority of the Segundo undergraduate housing complex and various alternative non-undergraduate housing such as Orchard Park, Russell Park, and The Colleges at LaRue Apartments.
<p>There are five public art statues found around campus, collectively called <a>The Egghead Series</a>, sculpted by former art professor <a>Robert Arneson</a> who taught at Davis from 1962-1991 before his death in 1992.
The egghead statues are considered by many to be among the most recognizable features of UC Davis's campus, and have even inspired a recent <a>blog</a> maintained by University staff.
Additional pieces of Arneson's work are part of the Fine Arts Collection maintained by the <a>Richard L. Nelson Gallery</a> located in the Art Building.</p>
The &quot;Yin &amp; Yang&quot; egg heads have been recast and duplicated for installment near the Port of San Francisco Ferry Building in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p><a>thumb|Bicycles, UC Davis</a><a>thumb|One of the double deckers in the city's student-run (and student-driven) bus system</a> UC Davis is famous for its large number of bicycles and bicyclists.
Bicyclists are ubiquitous around campus as well as the city, and thus a lot of bike-only infrastructure exists, such as bike circles, large bike lanes, and traffic signals exclusively for bikes.
It has been in operation since 1968 and is believed to be the only general purpose (non-sightseeing) transit system in the U.S. to operate vintage double deck buses in daily service.
Some students choose to live in the neighboring communities of <a>Sacramento</a>, <a>Dixon</a> or <a>Woodland</a>, and use their own cars or the county-wide Yolobus to get to UC Davis.</p>
It has a <a>Department of Viticulture and Enology</a> (concerning the scientific study of grape-growing and winemaking) that has been and continues to be responsible for significant advancements in winemaking utilized by many Californian wineries.
The Department of Applied Science was founded and formerly chaired by physicist <a>Edward Teller</a>.
<p>UC Davis has several professional schools: <a>UC Davis Graduate Studies</a>, <a>Graduate School of Management</a>, <a>School of Education</a>, <a>School of Law</a>, California's only public School of Veterinary Medicine, <a>School of Medicine</a> and <a>School of Nursing</a>.</p>
With more than sixty years in existence, it currently commissions roughly 30 to 40 graduating seniors as second lieutenants every year.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>In terms of Graduate Studies rankings, in 2006 <a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a> placed UC Davis First Nationally in Ecology and Evolution.</p>

If spotted wearing Aggie Blue by the Aggie Pack, students may have UC Davis paraphernalia thrown at them as a reward.</p>
The <em>Aggie</em> was first published in 1915 as the <em>Weekly Agricola</em> after its approval by the Associated Student Executive Committee.
At this point, UC Davis was considered the University Farm, an extension of <a>UC Berkeley</a>.&lt;ref
Novelist <a>Jack London</a> was one of the first readers of the <em>Weekly Agricola</em>.
In 1922, it was renamed to match the school's athletic name.&lt;ref
Today, the <em>Aggie</em> has the largest print distribution in <a>Yolo County</a>, at around 12,000 copies distributed daily.</p>
<p><a>thumb|right|UC Davis water tower</a> Social fraternities and sororities have been a part of the University of California at Davis since 1913.
One sorority, <a>Sigma Alpha Epsilon Pi</a>, was featured during the first season of the MTV reality show &quot;Sorority Life.&quot;</p>
<p>The <a>Phi Chapter of Alpha Gamma Rho</a> was locally established May 1 of 1923 at UC Davis making it the first continuously running national fraternity on campus.
Stadium (UC Davis)|Aggie Stadium]]]] :<em>For more information, see <a>UC Davis Aggies</a></em> The UC Davis <a>Aggies</a> (or Ags) compete in NCAA <a>Division I</a> sports in the <a>Big West Conference</a>.
For <a>football</a>, the Aggies compete in Division I <a>FCS</a> (formerly known as Division I-AA), and are members of the <a>Great West Conference</a>, granting UC Davis the distinction of being one of only three UC campuses to field a football team (<a>Cal</a> and <a>UCLA</a> being the other two).
The Aggies are also members of the <a>Mountain Pacific Sports Federation</a> in gymnastics and lacrosse, the <a>Western Intercollegiate Rowing Association</a> in <a>rowing</a>, and an associate member of the <a>Pacific-10 Conference</a> in wrestling.</p>
In 2008 the JV boat won first in nationals at the ACRA Championships in Tennessee and in 2009 the Varsity boat got second place in nationals at the ACRA Championships.
They consistently compete against teams such as Stanford, the University of Washington and UC Berkeley.</p>
<p>The Aggies finished first in <a>NCAA</a> <a>Division II</a> six times in 2003 and won the <a>NACDA Directors' Cup</a> 4 years in a row from 1999 to 2003.
In 1998, the UC Davis men's basketball team won the NCAA <a>Division II</a> national championship despite being one of the few non-scholarship institutions in Division II at that time.
They have also won NCAA Division II championships in Softball (2003), Men's Tennis (1992), and Women's Tennis (1990, 1993).
These and other achievements motivated a decision (following a year of heavy discussion by campus administrators, faculty, staff, students, alumni and the local community) in 2003 for the athletics program to re-classify to Division I.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; <a>thumb|Aggies at Stanford (half-time show), September 17, 2005</a> The highlight of the recent 4-year transition to Division I occurred on September 17, 2005, when the Aggies defeated the heavily favored <a>Stanford</a> Cardinal at <a>Stanford Stadium</a> by a score of 20-17 on a TD pass with 8 seconds left in the game.
The win in these two major sports and the addition of the Aggies beating the Cardinal in soccer earlier in 2005 as well as a win in wrestling and two wins in baseball pulled the Aggies' win loss record with Stanford to 5-1 for men's sports the 05-06 year.</p>

In addition, he received the &quot;Most Outstanding Wrestler&quot; award of the NCAA tournament.
In so doing, Derek Moore became the first UC Davis student-athlete to become a NCAA champion at the Division I level.
<p>Wrestling was cut from the athletic department in April 2010.
14 women's teams and 9 men's teams will be funded for the 2010-2011 school year.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
Students at UC Davis are referred to as Aggies in honor of the school's agricultural heritage.
There was a movement to change the school's mascot from the mustang to the <a>cow</a>, but despite student support this was turned down after opposition from alumni.
