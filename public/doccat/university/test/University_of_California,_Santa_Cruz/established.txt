<p> The <strong>University of California, Santa Cruz</strong>, also known as <strong>UC Santa Cruz</strong> or <strong>UCSC</strong>, is a <a>public</a>, <a>collegiate</a> <a>university</a>; one of ten campuses in the <a>University of California</a>.
<p>Founded in 1965,&lt;ref name=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; UC Santa Cruz began as a showcase for progressive, cross-disciplinary undergraduate education, innovative teaching methods and contemporary architecture.
<p>Although some of the original founders had already outlined plans for an institution like UCSC as early as the 1930s, the opportunity to realize their vision did not present itself until the City of Santa Cruz made a bid to the <a>University of California Regents</a> in the mid-1950s to build a campus just outside town, in the foothills of the <a>Santa Cruz Mountains</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;City council hasn't told&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Santa Cruz site was selected over a competing proposal to build the campus closer to the population center of [[San Jose, California|San Jose]].
Santa Cruz was selected for the beauty, rather than the practicality, of its location, however, and its remoteness led to the decision to develop a residential college system that would house most of the students on-campus.&lt;ref
name=&quot;McHenry UCSC origins&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The formal design process of the Santa Cruz campus began in the late 1950s, culminating in the Long Range Development Plan of 1963.&lt;ref
name=&quot;1963 LRDP&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Construction had started by 1964, and the University was able to accommodate its first students (albeit living in trailers on what is now the East Field athletic area) in 1965.
name=&quot;UC Regents history&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stadtman&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Burchyns 45 years&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to founding chancellor [[Dean McHenry]], the purpose of the distributed college system was to combine the benefits of a major [[research university]] with the intimacy of a smaller college.&lt;ref
name=&quot;Burns&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Burchyns future&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; UC President [[Clark Kerr]] shared a passion with former [[Stanford]] roommate McHenry to build a university modeled as &quot;several [[Swarthmore College|Swarthmores]]&quot; (i.e., small [[liberal arts college]]s) in close proximity to each other.&lt;ref
name=&quot;Burns&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Roads on campus were named after [[Regents of the University of California|UC Regents]] who voted in favor of building the campus.</pre>
<p>Although the city of <a>Santa Cruz</a> already exhibited a strong <a>conservation ethic</a> before the founding of the university, the coincidental rise of the <a>counterculture of the 1960s</a> with the university's establishment fundamentally altered its subsequent development.
name=&quot;Burchins3&quot;&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; A large and growing population of politically <a>liberal</a> UCSC <a>alumni</a> changed the electorate of the town from predominantly <a>Republican</a>&lt;ref&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; to markedly <a>left-leaning</a>, consistently voting against expansion measures on the part of both <a>town and gown</a>.
<a>Mike Rotkin</a>, UCSC alumnus, lecturer in <a>Community Studies</a>, and self-described '<a>socialist-feminist</a>,' has been elected Mayor of Santa Cruz several times.
<p>&lt;/timeline&gt; ::&lt;small&gt;&#x2020;Died in office&lt;/small&gt; |}</p>
<p> <a>Plans</a> for increasing enrollment over the next 14 years to 19,500 students, adding 1,500 faculty and staff, and, secondarily the anticipated environmental impacts of such action encountered opposition from the city, the local community, and the student body.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; City voters in 2006 passed two measures calling on UCSC to pay for the impacts of campus growth.
UCSC agreed to local government scrutiny of its north campus expansion plans, to provide housing for 67 percent of the additional students on campus, and to pay municipal development and water fees.&lt;ref
<p>George Blumenthal, UCSC's 10th Chancellor, intends to mitigate growth constraints in Santa Cruz by developing off-campus sites in <a>Silicon Valley</a>.
Elevation varies from 285 feet (87 m) at the campus entrance to 1,195 feet (364 m) at the northern boundary, a difference of about 900 feet (275 m).
The southern portion of the campus primarily consists of a large, open <a>meadow</a>, locally known as the Great Meadow.
To the north of the meadow lie most of the campus' buildings, many of them among <a>redwood</a> groves.
The campus is bounded on the south by the city's upper-west-side neighborhoods, on the east by Harvey West Park&lt;ref&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; and the <a>Pogonip open space preserve</a>,&lt;ref&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; on the north by <a>Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park</a>&lt;ref&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; near the town of <a>Felton</a>, and on the west by <a>Gray Whale Ranch</a>, a portion of <a>Wilder Ranch State Park</a>.
&lt;ref&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; The campus is built on a portion of the <a>Cowell Family ranch</a>, which was purchased by the University of California in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; The northern half of the campus property has remained in its undeveloped, forested state apart from fire roads and hiking and bicycle trails.
These structures, mostly assembled from branches and other forest detritus, were formerly concentrated in the area known as Elfland, a glen the University razed in 1992 to build colleges Nine and Ten.
Students were able to relocate and save some of the structures, however.&lt;ref&gt;
Footbridges span those ravines on pedestrian paths linking various areas of campus.
The footbridges make it possible to walk to any part of campus within 20 minutes in spite of the campus being built on a mountainside with varying elevations.
The Jack Baskin Engineering Building, formerly known as the Applied Sciences Building, began sinking shortly after it was built; in the late 1970s, hundreds of tons of concrete were poured underneath its foundation to prevent it from sinking.</p>
&lt;ref&gt; (Note: Registration required) &lt;/ref&gt; Interdisciplinary programs, such as Feminist Studies, American Studies, Environmental Studies, Digital Arts and New Media, and the unique <a>History of Consciousness</a> Department are also hosted alongside UCSC's more traditional academic departments.</p>
<p>In an effort to cut $13 million dollars, as required by the University of California office of the President and Board of Regents in a decision to cut 10% from the budget of each campus, UCSC nearly eliminated its longstanding and sometimes controversial undergraduate major Community Studies in 2009.
Community Studies and other majors within the Social Sciences division, including some graduate programs, remain threatened by more cuts expected in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
<p>Although designed as a liberal arts-oriented university, UCSC quickly acquired a graduate-level <a>natural science</a> research component with the appointment of plant physiologist <a>Kenneth V. Thimann</a> as the first provost of <a>Crown College</a>.
Immediately upon its founding, UCSC was also granted administrative responsibility for the <a>Lick Observatory</a>, which established the campus as a major center for <a>astronomy</a> research.&lt;ref
name=&quot;Clark&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Founding members of the Social Science and Humanities faculty created the unique <a>History of Consciousness</a> graduate program in UCSC's first year of operation.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>As of 2006, UCSC's faculty included two members of the <a>Institute of Medicine</a>, 21 members of the <a>Academy of Arts and Sciences</a>, and eleven members of the <a>National Academy of Sciences</a>.&lt;ref
name=&quot;overview&quot; /&gt; The young <a>Baskin School of Engineering</a>, UCSC's first professional school and home to the <a>Expressive Intelligence Studio</a>, and the Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; are gaining recognition, as has the work that UCSC researchers <a>David Haussler</a> and <a>Jim Kent</a> have done on the <a>Human Genome Project</a>,&lt;ref&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; including the widely used <a>UCSC Genome Browser</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
<p>Off-campus research facilities maintained by UCSC include the <a>Lick</a> and <a>Keck</a> Observatories and the <a>Long Marine Laboratory</a>.
In September 2003, a ten-year task order contract valued at more than $330 million was awarded by <a>NASA Ames Research Center</a> to the University of California to establish and operate a University Affiliated Research System (UARC).
UCSC manages the UARC for the University of California.&lt;ref&gt;
name=&quot;The Washington Monthly ranking&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2005 report by SCI-BYTES magazine, UCSC ranked second in the United States for academic research impact in the field of space sciences between 1999 and 2003, behind <a>Princeton University</a>.
&lt;ref&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; A report in 2002 had ranked UCSC first for research impact in the space sciences and second in physics.
&lt;ref&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; In the last National Research Council rankings of graduate programs, published in 1995, Astronomy and Astrophysics and Linguistics both ranked in the top ten.
In 2009, RePEc, an online database of research economics articles, ranked the UCSC Economics Department sixth in the world in the field of international finance.
&lt;ref&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, High Times magazine placed UCSC as first among US universities as a &quot;counterculture college.&quot;
<p><a>thumb|Approaching Baskin Engineering from McLaughlin Drive</a> The undergraduate program, with only the partial exception of those majors run through the University's School of Engineering, is still based on the version of the &quot;<a>residential college system</a>&quot; outlined by Clark Kerr and Dean McHenry at the inception of their original plans for the campus (see <a>History</a>, above).
name=&quot;collegesection&quot;/&gt; College resident populations vary from about 750 to 1,550 students, with roughly half of undergraduates living on campus within their college community or in smaller, intramural campus communities such as the International Living Center, the Trailer Park, and the Village.&lt;ref
name=&quot;collegesection&quot;/&gt; Coursework, academic majors and general areas of study are not limited by college membership, although colleges host the offices of many academic departments.
In 2008, UCSC offered admission to a record number of 19,138 new undergraduate students out of 25,746 applications for the Fall term, representing an increase in selectivity to 74.3 percent from 82.8 percent admitted in 2007.
&lt;ref&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; About half of graduates pursue further education, and 13 percent proceed to advanced degree programs within six months of graduation.
<p>For most of its history, UCSC employed a unique <a>student evaluation</a> system.
name=&quot;Clark&quot;/&gt; In 2008 the McHenry Library began to be renovated.
The McHenry Special Collections Library includes the archives of <a>Robert A. Heinlein</a>, the largest collection of <a>Edward Weston</a> photographs in the country, the <a>mycology</a> book collection of composer <a>John Cage</a>, a large collection of works by <a>Satyajit Ray</a>, the <a>Hayden White</a> collection of 16th century Italian printing, a photography collection with nearly half a million items, and the Mary Lea Shane Archive.
&lt;/ref&gt; UCSC beat out petitions from Stanford and UC Berkeley to house the archives.
<p>According to a 2002 study of first year students, most students come from <a>affluent</a> backgrounds and are more likely to identify as <a>liberal</a> than the <a>national average</a>.&lt;ref
name=&quot;CIRP&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The <a>median household income</a> UCSC students reported for their families of origin was $80,600, roughly 87.5% above the national average in 2002.&lt;ref
name=&quot;CIRP&quot;/&gt; The majority of respondents, 59%, identified as liberal, 34% as &quot;Middle of the Road&quot; and 8% as <a>conservative</a>.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIRP&quot;/&gt; Though UCSC students come from throughout the United States and the world, a large majority are from <a>California</a>.

On April 20, 2010, the school administration shut down the west entrance to campus and limited the amount of buses that could drive through campus.&lt;ref&gt;
Students run around campus naked or nearly naked to celebrate the school year's first night of heavy rain.
<p><a>thumb|Student Union</a> The Student Union Assembly was founded in 1985 to better coordinate bargaining positions between students and administration on campus-wide issues.&lt;ref&gt;
<li><em><a>City on a Hill Press</a></em>, a weekly publication that serves as the traditional campus newspaper.</li>
<li><em>Student Cable Television (SCTV)</em> disbanded at the beginning of the 2010 academic school year.
Some halls have coed floors where men and women share bathroom facilities, others have separate bathroom facilities for men and women.
<p>All of the colleges, except for Kresge, have both residence halls and apartments.
<p>In addition to the residential colleges, housing is available at the Village on the lower quarry, populated by continuing, transfer, and graduate students; the University Inn, a remodeled hotel in downtown Santa Cruz that accommodates all students; Redwood Grove, formerly Kresge East, now available to applicants from all colleges; and the University Town Center, also located downtown, that primarily serves international students.
Since the incident was captured on video, the individuals involved were charged with misdemeanor grand theft and vandalism.
<p><a>thumb|East Field</a> UCSC competes in <a>Division III</a> of the <a>NCAA</a> as an Independent member.
After defeating Emory to win the 2007 National Championship in men's tennis, UCSC has won six men's tennis team championships, and have been defending champions in tennis for two of the past three years.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 2006 season, the men's water polo team won the Division III championship, as well as an overall ranking of 19th in the nation.
However, both the men and women's water polo teams were cut in 2008 due to budget constraints.&lt;ref&gt;
<p>In addition to its NCAA sports, UCSC maintains a number of successful club sides including its women's <a>rugby</a> team, which won the <a>Division II</a> National Collegiate Championship during its '05-'06 season.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1981, when the university began participating in NCAA intercollegiate sports, the then-chancellor and some student athletes declared the mascot to be the &quot;<a>sea lions</a>.&quot;
In 1986, students voted via <a>referendum</a> to declare the banana slug the official mascot of UCSC &#x2014; a vote the chancellor refused to honor, arguing that only athletes should choose the mascot.
When a poll of athletes showed that they, too, wanted to be &quot;Slugs,&quot; the chancellor relented.
The June 16, 1986, issue of <em>People</em> magazine featured a full-page spread dedicated to the selection of the Banana Slug as the official mascot of UCSC (see page 85).&lt;ref&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; A sea lion statue can still be seen in front of the Thimann Hall lecture building.&lt;ref&gt;
It was developed by two students during the mascot controversy, who later incorporated as &quot;Oxford West&quot; and licensed their design from the Regents to produce clothing inspired by the university.</p>
