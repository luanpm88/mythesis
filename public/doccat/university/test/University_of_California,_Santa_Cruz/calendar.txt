Since then, UCSC has evolved into a modern research university with a wide variety of both undergraduate and graduate programs, while retaining its reputation for strong undergraduate support and student political activism.
The residential college system, which consists of ten small colleges, is intended to combine the student support of a small college with the resources of a major university.</pre>
Early student and faculty activism at UCSC pioneered an approach to <a>environmentalism</a> that greatly impacted the industrial development of the surrounding area.&lt;ref&gt;
In 2008, the university, city, county and neighborhood organizations reached an agreement to set aside numerous lawsuits and allow the expansion to occur.

name=&quot;collegesection&quot;&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; Almost all faculty members are affiliated with a college as well.&lt;ref
name=&quot;collegesection&quot;/&gt; The individual colleges provide housing and dining services, while the university as a whole offers courses and majors to the general student community.&lt;ref
name=&quot;collegesection&quot;/&gt; Other universities with similar college systems include <a>Rice University</a> and the <a>University of California, San Diego</a>.</p>
<p>Each of the colleges has its own, distinctive architectural style and a resident faculty <a>provost</a>, who is the nominal head of his or her college.&lt;ref
Graduate students are not affiliated with a residential college, though a large portion of their offices, too, have historically tended to be based in the colleges.
<h3>Enrollment and retention</h3>
&lt;/ref&gt; In the Fall 2006 semester, UCSC enrolled 13,941 undergraduates and 1,419 graduate and postgraduate students, for a student body total of 15,360.
&lt;ref name=&quot;stats&quot;&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; In general, <a>graduation</a> and retention rates are above national averages but below the mean among UC campuses.
Earlier statistics show that the six-year graduation rate is above the mean for both NCAA Division I schools and a sample of major universities throughout the United States.
The only <a>grades</a> assigned were &quot;pass&quot; and &quot;no record&quot;, supplemented with <a>narrative evaluation</a>s.
As of 2010, the narrative evaluations were deemed an unnecessary expenditure and students are now required to ask for a narrative evaluation to complement letter grades.&lt;ref&gt;
Although the default grading option for almost all courses offered is now &quot;graded&quot;, most course grades are still accompanied by written evaluations.

Students and others openly smoked marijuana while campus police stood by.&lt;ref&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; The once student-only event has grown since the city of Santa Cruz passed <a>Measure K</a> in 2006, an ordinance making marijuana use a low-priority crime for police.
