In 2009, UCSC offered admission to 63.7% of applicants.
UCSC hopes to contain the entering class to about 3,700 students.&lt;ref&gt;
Students were still given narrative evaluations to complement the letter grades.
&lt;/ref&gt; Students can still elect to receive a &quot;pass/no pass&quot; grade, but many academic programs limit or even forbid pass/no pass grading.
Overall, students may now earn no more than 25% of their UCSC credits on a &quot;pass/no pass&quot; basis.
An annex is being added to update the library.
The latter contains an extensive collection of photographs, letters, and other documents related to <a>Lick Observatory</a> dating back to 1870.
&lt;ref&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; A new addition to the library opened March 31, 2008.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; UCSC plans to devote an entire room at the library, to be called &quot;Dead Central,&quot; to display the collection and encourage research.&lt;ref&gt;
There could not have been a cozier place for this collection to land.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

<p>UCSC is home to many fraternities and sororities.
After a highly successful 2008 season, the team traveled to Texas for nationals.
Although UCSC never had a track, the residential colleges regularly competed in an improvised &quot;Slug Run&quot; every spring from 1967 to 1982,&lt;ref&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; though the Run now is a community event and fundraiser event hosted by the cross-country club for much needed fund to pay for entry fees, hotel, and transportation to race.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Cross
