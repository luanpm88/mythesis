There is no <a>dean&#x2019;s list</a> or honor roll per se, but students who maintain a GPA of 3.5 or above for an entire academic year receive academic commendations, which are noted on their transcripts, at the end of the spring semester.
Reed also has several intercollegiate athletic teams, most notably the Rugby, Fencing, and Ultimate Frisbee teams.
There is also an &quot;Honor Council,&quot; which consists of students, faculty, and staff, designed to educate the community regarding the Honor Principle and mediate conflict between individuals.</p>
<li>Division of Arts: includes the Art (Art History and Studio Art), Dance, Music, and Theatre Departments;</li>
<li>Division of Philosophy, Religion, Psychology, and Linguistics: includes the Psychology, Philosophy, Religion, and Linguistics Departments.</li>
<p>Reed President Richard Scholz in 1922 called the educational program as a whole &quot;an honest effort to disregard old historic rivalries and hostilities between the sciences and the arts, between professional and cultural subjects, and, ... the formal chronological cleavage between the graduate and the undergraduate attitude of mind&quot;.
Since 2002, Reed's attrition rate has moved toward that of peer institutions, and the five-year graduation rate (76% for the 2003/2004 entering class) now exceeds the national average.
<p>In 2009, the applicant pool for the class of 2013 was the third largest in Reed's history: 3,159 students applied and 1,225 were admitted, for an admission rate of 38.8%.
In 2009-10 about half of students received financial aid from the college.
During the 2009 fiscal year, the endowment is expected to contribute about $19 million toward the college's operating expenses, an increase of about $3 million from two years ago.</p>
Reed has also made the same claim.</p>
According to an article in the college's alumni magazine, &quot;because of the decisive support expressed by Reed's faculty, students, and alumni for the three besieged teachers and for the principle of academic freedom, Reed College's experience with McCarthyism stands apart from that of most other American colleges and universities.
Reed announced on July 13, 2007, that it had purchased the Rivelli farm, a  tract of land south of the Garden House and west of Botsford Drive.
Reed&#x2019;s &quot;immediate plans for the acquired property include housing a small number of students in the former Rivelli home during the 2007&#x2013;08 academic year.
Longer term, the college anticipates that it may seek to develop the northern portion of the property for additional student housing&quot;.</p>
At present, the College provides on-campus housing for 838 students&quot;.</p>
<p>A landmark of the campus, the <a>Blue Bridge</a>, spans the canyon.
This bridge, dubbed the &quot;Bouncy Bridge&quot; by students, is  long, about a third longer than the Blue Bridge, and &quot;connect[s] the new north campus quad to Gray Campus Center, the student union, the library, and academic buildings on the south side of campus&quot;.
In pursuit of its mission to support the curriculum of the art, art history, and humanities programs at Reed, the gallery produces three or four exhibitions each year, along with lectures, colloquia, and artist visits.
Suiting the student body, <a>vegan</a> and vegetarian dishes feature heavily on the menu.
It is currently the only cafeteria on the small campus, with the exception Caffe Paradiso, a small cafe on the other side of campus which also accepts board points.</p>
It is the only campus dorm that is independent of the school's board plan.
In 2003 the Paradox opened a second cafe, dubbing it the &quot;Paradox Lost&quot; (an allusion to <a>John Milton</a>'s <em><a>Paradise Lost</a></em>), at the southern end of the biology building, in the space commonly called the &quot;Bio Fishbowl&quot;.
The griffin was featured on the coat-of-arms of founder Simeon Reed Over the years, institutional memory of this fact has faded and the color appearing on the school's publications and merchandise has darkened to a shade of maroon.
A small group of students has recently been petitioning the bookstore to update the shirts' text to read, &quot;Socialism, Agnosticism, Safe Sex&quot;, a comment on the increasingly moderate (though still quite radical) predominating values of the student body.
<p>One of the unofficial symbols of Reed is the Doyle Owl, a roughly  concrete statue that has been continuously stolen and re-stolen since 1913.
<p>Well-known on-campus myths claim there is an intact <a>MG</a> under the concrete foundation of the college library, an underground primate lab working exclusively with <a>snow monkey</a>s under the Psychology building (the legend states that the presence of this lab was discovered when a snow monkey escaped into the Canyon and necessitated the closing of the facility), and a four-story lab/habitation <a>arcology</a> under the Physics building.
<p>During the week before the beginning of second-semester classes, the campus holds <a>Paideia</a> (roughly drawn from the Greek, meaning 'education').
This festival of learning takes the form of ten days (although originally a whole month) of classes and seminars put on by anyone who wishes to teach, including students, professors, staff members, and outside educators invited on-campus by members of the Reed Community.
While the full calligraphy course is no longer taught at Reed, Paideia usually features a short course on the subject.</p>
<p>[[Image:Olde-Reede-RennFayre06.JPG|thumb|right|A student-made [[Katamari Damacy|katamari]] at the 2006 Renn Fayre]] Renn Fayre is an annual three-day celebration at Reed with a different theme each year.
Students, faculty, and staff gather at the entrance to the library where chaos and champagne get the party started.
The parade commences when the senior class moves through the library and out through what was the library's original front entrance (now an emergency exit).</p>
<p>Renn Fayre is often called the metaphorical explosion of the student body after a year of intense pressure.
Serious injuries are rare, thanks in part to the non-profit White Bird Clinic, and the presence of vigilant student volunteers (the &quot;Karma Patrol&quot;) who stay sober, distribute bagels and water, and ensure the wellness of Renn Fayre participants, while the &quot;Border Patrol&quot; sees to the exclusion of unauthorized visitors.</p>
<p>Student participation is almost unanimous; faculty and staff also attend some of the festivities.
The fee underwrites publication of the student newspaper and extracurricular activities, and partially supports the student union and ski cabin&quot;.
