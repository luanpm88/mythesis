The <strong>Reed Institute</strong> (the legal name of the college) was founded in 1908, and Reed College held its first classes in 1911.
Simeon was an entrepreneur in trade on the <a>Columbia River</a>; in his will he suggested that his wife could &quot;devote some portion of my estate to benevolent objects, or to the cultivation, illustration, or development of the fine arts in the city of Portland, or to some other suitable purpose, which shall be of permanent value and contribute to the beauty of the city and to the intelligence, prosperity, and happiness of the inhabitants&quot;.
Its program in the sciences is likewise unusual &mdash; Reed's <a>TRIGA research reactor</a> makes it the only school in the United States to have a <a>nuclear reactor</a> operated entirely by undergraduates.
While large lecture-style classes exist, Reed emphasizes its smaller lab and conference sections.</p>
<p>Reed categorizes its academic program into five Divisions and the Humanities program.
The Humanities program, which came into being in 1943 (as the union of two year-long courses, one in &quot;world&quot; literature, the other in &quot;world&quot; history) is one manifestation of this effort.
One change to the program was the addition of a course in Chinese Civilization in 1995.
The admitted class of 2013's average combined Math and Verbal <a>SAT</a> scores were 1407; the mean composite ACT score was 31; and the mean high school <a>GPA</a> was 4.034.</p>
<p>Reed's endowment as of June 30, 2008 was $427.3 million, below the median of about $500m for comparable schools, and well below Amherst and Swarthmore's approximately one billion dollar endowments.
<p> In 1995 Reed College refused to participate in the <a>U.S. News and World Report</a> &quot;best colleges&quot; rankings, making it the first educational institution in the United States to refuse to participate in college rankings.
Nicholas Thompson reiterated this judgment in an article in <em>The Washington Monthly</em> in 2000.
<p>However, in 2005 Reed did submit statistics to the <a>Princeton Review</a>, and received first in Overall Undergraduate Academic Experience.
In 2009, The <a>Princeton Review</a> ranked Reed number two in &quot;Best Classroom Experience,&quot; number three in &quot;Students Study the Most,&quot; and number five in &quot;Birkenstock-Wearing, Tree-Hugging, Clove-Smoking Vegetarians&quot;.
moreover, places Reed as one of the top ten liberal arts colleges in the country.</p>
Reed is third in percentage of its graduates who go on to earn Ph.D.s in all disciplines, after only <a>Caltech</a> and <a>Harvey Mudd</a>.
At Reed, however, opposition to the political interrogations of the teachers was so strong that some believed the campus was in danger of closure&quot;.
A statement of &quot;regret&quot; by the Reed administration and Board of Trustees was published in 1981, formally revising the judgment of the 1954 trustees.
In 1993, then-President Steve Koblik invited Moore to visit the College, and in 1995 the last surviving member of the Board that fired Moore expressed his regret and apologized to him.</p>
E. Doyle's 1920 Master Plan</a> The Reed College campus was established on a southeast <a>Portland</a> tract of land known in 1910 as Crystal Springs Farm, a part of the Ladd Estate, formed in the 1870s from original land claims.
In contrast, the science section of campus, including the physics, biology, and psychology (originally chemistry) buildings, were designed in the <a>Modernist</a> style.
Since 2004, Reed's campus has expanded to include adjacent properties beyond its historic boundaries, such as the Birchwood Apartments complex and former medical administrative offices on either side of SE 28th Avenue, and the Parker House, across SE Woodstock from Prexy.
At the same time the Willard House (donated to Reed in 1964), across from the college's main entrance at SE Woodstock and SE Reed College Place, was converted from faculty housing to administrative use.
language houses (Spanish, Russian, French, German, and Chinese), &quot;temporary&quot; housing, built in the 1960s (Cross Canyon - Chittick, Woodbridge, McKinley, Griffin), to more recently built dorms (Bragdon, Naito, Sullivan).
The college's least-loved complex (as measured by applications to the College's housing lottery), MacNaughton and Foster-Scholz, is known on campus as &quot;Asylum Block&quot; because of its post-World War II modernist architecture and interior spaces dominated by long, straight corridors lined with identical doors, said by students to resemble that of an <a>insane asylum</a>.
It attracted great architectural interest during its lifetime&quot;.
The Blue Bridge was originally  known as the &quot;Cross Canyon Bridge&quot; until student Rain Lynham bought and installed black lights in 1998 as decoration for Renn Fayre, the traditional end of year, campus-wide party, of which she was the organizer that year.
<p>A new pedestrian and bicycle bridge spanning the canyon was opened in Fall 2008.
<p>An unofficial <a>motto</a> of Reed is &quot;Communism, Atheism, Free Love&quot;, and can be found in the Reed College Bookstore on sweaters, t-shirts, etc.
<p>An alternative motto first appeared on shirts in 1976 as &quot;Capitalism, Avarice, Free Beer&quot;, but never overtook the original in popularity.
Additionally, the punning &quot;Reed: You Might Learn Something&quot; was a popular slogan in the mid-1980s.&lt;br
The original Doyle Owl was almost certainly destroyed many years ago, but a number of replicas (of varying degrees of quality) remain in circulation, contributing to the frequency of its appearance.
Born in the 1960s as an actual <a>renaissance fair</a>, it has long since lost all connection to anachronism and the <a>Renaissance</a>, although its name has persisted.</p>
<p>The school's student-run newspaper, the <em>Quest</em>, has been published since 1913, and its radio station, <a>KRRC</a>, has been broadcasting, with a few interruptions, since 1955.</p>
Some organizations, such as the Motorized Couch Collective &ndash; dedicated to installing motors and wheels into furniture &#x2013; have become more Reed myth than reality in recent years.</p>
