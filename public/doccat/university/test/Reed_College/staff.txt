<p><strong>Reed College</strong> is a <a>private</a>, <a>independent</a>, <a>liberal arts college</a> located in southeast <a>Portland, Oregon</a>.
Founded in 1908, Reed is a residential college with a campus located in Portland's <a>Eastmoreland</a> neighborhood, featuring architecture based on the <a>Tudor</a>-<a>Gothic</a> style, and a forested canyon wilderness preserve at its center.
Reed is known for its mandatory freshman <a>humanities</a> program, for its required senior-year thesis, as the only private undergraduate college with a primarily student-run <a>nuclear reactor</a> supporting its science programs, and for the unusually high percentage of graduates who go on to earn PhDs and other postgraduate degrees.</p>

Reed is named for Oregon pioneers <a>Simeon Gannett Reed</a> and Amanda Reed.
The first president of Reed (1910&ndash;1919) was <a>William Trufant Foster</a>, a former professor at <a>Bates College</a> and <a>Bowdoin College</a> in <a>Maine</a>.</p>
Founded explicitly in reaction to the &quot;prevailing model of East Coast, <a>Ivy League</a> education,&quot; the college's lack of <a>varsity athletics</a>, <a>fraternities</a>, and exclusive social clubs &mdash; as well as its <a>coeducational</a>, <a>nonsectarian</a>, and <a>egalitarian</a> status &mdash; gave way to an intensely academic and intellectual college whose purpose was to devote itself to &quot;the life of the mind&quot;.</p>
<p>The college holds a reputation for the <a>progressive</a> and anti-authoritarian leanings of its community.</p>
<p>According to <a>sociologist</a> Burton Clark, Reed is one of the most unusual institutions of higher learning in the <a>United States</a>, featuring a traditional liberal arts and natural sciences curriculum.
It requires freshmen to take Humanities 110 &mdash; an intensive introduction to the <a>Classics</a>, covering ancient <a>Greece</a> and <a>Rome</a> as well as the <a>Bible</a> and <a>ancient Jewish history</a>.
and its small classes emphasize a &quot;conference&quot; style, in which the teacher often acts as a mediator for discussion rather than a lecturer.
Many Reedies graduate without knowing either their cumulative <a>GPA</a> or their grades in individual classes.
And though Reed does not award <a>Latin honors</a> to graduates, Reed does confer several awards for academic achievement at the time of commencement, including naming students to <a>Phi Beta Kappa</a>.</p>
<p>Reed has no fraternities or <a>sororities</a>, and few <a>NCAA</a> sports teams, although physical education classes (which range from <a>kayaking</a> to <a>juggling</a>) are required for graduation.
While inspired by traditional <a>honor system</a>s, Reed's Honor Principle differs from these in that it is a guide for ethical standards themselves, not just their enforcement.
Overall, Reed offers five <a>Humanities</a> courses, twenty-six department majors, twelve interdisciplinary majors, six dual-degree programs with other colleges and universities, and programs for pre-medical and pre-veterinary students.</p>
<p>Reed's Humanities program includes the mandatory freshman course <em>Introduction to Western Humanities</em> covering ancient <a>Greek</a> and <a>Roman</a> literature, history, art, religion, and philosophy.
Sophomores, juniors, and seniors may take <em>Early Modern Europe</em> covering <a>Renaissance</a> thought and literature; <em>Modern Humanities</em> covering the <a>Enlightenment</a>, the <a>French Revolution</a>, the <a>Industrial Revolution</a>, and <a>Modernism</a>, and/or <em>Foundations of Chinese Civilization</em>.
<p>Reed offers <a>dual-degree programs</a> in Applied Physics (with <a>OHSU</a>/<a>OGI</a>), Computer Science (with <a>University of Washington</a>), Engineering (with <a>Caltech</a> and others), Environmental Science (with <a>Duke University</a>), and Fine Art (with the <a>Pacific Northwest College of Art</a>).</p>
<p><a>right|thumb|Eliot Hall</a> Until the late 1990s, Reed accepted a larger percentage of total applicants than peer institutions &#x2014; 76% in 1996.
Since then, the number of applicants for freshman admission has increased sharply.

<p><em><a>Rolling Stone</a></em>, in its 16 October 1997 issue, argued that Reed's rankings were artificially decreased by <em>U.S. News</em> after they stopped sending data to <em><a>U.S. News and World Report</a>.</em>
In 2006, <a>Newsweek</a> magazine named Reed as one of twenty-five &quot;New Ivies,&quot; listing it among &quot;the nation's elite colleges&quot;.
<p>Reed has produced the second-highest number of <a>Rhodes scholars</a> for any liberal arts college&mdash;31&mdash;as well as over fifty <a>Fulbright Scholars</a>, over sixty <a>Watson Fellow</a>s, and two <a>MacArthur (&quot;Genius&quot;) Award</a> winners.
A very high proportion of Reed graduates go on to earn <a>Ph.D.</a>s, particularly in the <a>science</a>s, <a>history</a>, <a>political science</a>, and <a>philosophy</a>.
Reed is first in this percentage in <a>biology</a>, second in <a>chemistry</a> and <a>humanities</a>, third in <a>history</a>, <a>foreign language</a>s, and <a>political science</a>, fourth in the <a>physical sciences</a>, <a>math</a> and <a>computer science</a>, and <a>science</a> and <a>engineering</a>, fifth in <a>physics</a> and <a>social sciences</a>, sixth in <a>anthropology</a>, seventh in <a>area and ethnic studies</a> and <a>linguistics</a>, and eighth in <a>English literature</a> and the <a>medical sciences</a>.
<p><a>thumb|left|Old Dorm Block</a>&#x0009;  Reed has a reputation for being politically left-wing.
<p>Since the 1960s, Reed has had a reputation for tolerating open drug use among its students.

<p>Portland architect <a>A.
E. Doyle</a> developed a plan modeled on <a>Oxford University</a>'s St. John's College that was never implemented in full.
Until 2006, it was thought that these residence halls had been designed by architect <a>Pietro Belluschi</a>.
The Cooley Gallery has exhibited international artists such as <a>Mona Hatoum</a>, <a>Al Held</a>, <a>Marko Lulic</a> and <a>Gregory Crewdson</a> as well as the contemporary art collection of <a>Michael Ovitz</a>.
Many houses in the <a>Woodstock</a> and <a>Eastmoreland</a> Portland neighborhoods are traditionally rented to Reed students.
In mythology, the griffin often pulled the chariot of the sun; in canto 32 of <a>Dante</a>'s <em><a>Commedia</a></em> the <a>gryphon</a> is associated with the <a>Tree of Knowledge</a>.
This term faded out in favor of the now ubiquitous &quot;Reedie&quot; after <a>World War II</a>.
It was a label that the Reed community claimed from critics during the 1920s as a &quot;tongue-in-cheek slogan&quot; in reference to Reed's <a>nonconformism</a>. Reed's founding president William T. Foster's outspoken opposition against the entrance of the United States into <a>World War I</a>, as well as the college's support for <a>feminism</a>, its adherence to academic freedom (i.e., inviting a leader of the <a>Socialist Party of America</a> to speak on campus about the <a>Russian Revolution</a>&#x2019;s potential impact on <a>militarism</a>, emancipation of women, and ending the persecution of Jews), and its <a>nonsectarian</a> status made the college a natural target for what was originally meant to be a pejorative slur.</p>
/&gt; <a>150px|thumb|left|Faux Reed Seal</a> Another popular characterization was from a letter to the local newspaper, in which Reed students were said to resemble &quot;unmade beds&quot; which provided a subject for creating special Reed occasion costumes.
<p>Every year's <em>Reed College Student Handbook</em> (a manual on student life written by students, not to be confused with the <em>College Handbook</em>, which is written by college officials) contains a test called the &quot;Reed College Immorality Quotient&quot; that tests an individual's <a>immorality</a> on topics such as <a>sex</a>, <a>theft</a>, and <a>drug use</a>.</p>
Traditions and events include bizarre art installations, bug-eating contests, the alumni Meat Smoke, a naked <a>Slip 'n Slide</a>, occasional motorized couches, fireworks, naked people painting themselves blue (a tribute to the ancient <a>Picts</a>), a <a>beer garden</a>, the Glo Opera (performed at night by actors covered in EL wire and glowsticks), lube wrestling, full-contact human chess, parachuters, castle-storming and bike-jousting by members of <a>C.H.V.N.K. 666</a>, a fire-dancing performance by the Weapons of Mass Distraction (the college's own Fire Troupe), a softball tournament of academic department teams, a feast contributed to by student-donated leftover board points, a cooking contest, and a general sense of mayhem.
The Reed archive of <a>comic book</a>s and <a>graphic novel</a>s, the MLLL (Comic Book Reading Room), is well into its fourth decade, and Beer Nation, the student group that organizes and manages various <a>beer garden</a>s throughout the year and during <a>Renn Fayre</a>, has existed for many years.
