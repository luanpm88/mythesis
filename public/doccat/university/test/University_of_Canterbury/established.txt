<p>The University has a main campus of 76 hectares at <a>Ilam</a>, a suburb of Christchurch: about 5&nbsp;km from the centre of the city.
Adjacent to the main campus stands the University's College of Education, with its own sports-fields and grounds.
The University maintains five <a>libraries</a>, with the Central Library () housed in the tallest building on campus, the 11-storey James Hight building.
<p>The University's College of Education maintains additional small campuses in <a>Nelson</a>, <a>Tauranga</a> and <a>Timaru</a>, and &quot;teaching centres&quot; in <a>Greymouth</a>, <a>New Plymouth</a>, <a>Rotorua</a> and Timaru.
The University has staff in regional information offices in Nelson, Timaru, and <a>Auckland</a>.
<p>Canterbury University has six <a>halls of residence</a> housing around 1800 students.
Three of these halls (Ilam Apartments, University Hall and Sonoda Christchurch Campus) are managed by UC Accommodation, a subsidiary of Campus Living Villages, while the university maintains ownership of the property and buildings.

<p>Professor Roy Sharp assumed the position of <a>Vice-Chancellor</a> on 1 March 2003.&lt;ref
On 15 October 2008 the University announced that Dr Rod Carr would begin a five-year appointment as Vice-Chancellor on 1 February 2009.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
Council member and former Pro-Chancellor, Mr Rex Williams, became chancellor in 2008.
Council Member John Wood became the new Pro-Chancellor.
<p>The Council includes representatives from the faculties, students and general staff, as well as local industry, employer and trade union representatives.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>In 2004 the University underwent restructuring into four Colleges and a School of Law, administering a number of schools and departments (though a number of departments have involvement in cross-teaching in numerous academic faculties).
2007 saw the addition of a fifth College with the merging of the Christchurch College of Education into the University.
<li>the School of Humanities</li>
<li>The College of Business and Economics,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; administering:
<li>the School of Forestry</li>
<li>the School of Biological Sciences</li>
<li>the School of M&#x0101;ori, Social and Cultural Studies in Education</li>
<li>the School of Literacies and Arts in Education</li>
<li>The School of Law&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</li>
Each College and the School of Law has as its head a <a>Pro-Vice-Chancellor</a> (PVC), who answers to the <a>Vice-Chancellor</a> for all activities of the College/School.
College Offices support the PVCs, providing financial, administrative, academic, and human-resources advice to each PVC.
Each College also has a College Manager, who acts as the day-to-day manager of the College.</p>
<p>Each faculty consists of the teaching-staff of the departments and schools who offer courses that may form part of the particular degree from that faculty.
Student representatives participate in governing the various faculties.
<p>The University receives funding from student fees, the New Zealand government (in partial support of domestic students, and via various research funding mechanisms), non-government research funding agencies, bequests and so on.</p>
<p>Together with the New Zealand government, the University formed the <a>UCi3</a> ICT Innovation Institute in 2006 to commercialize research and to encourage local high-tech <a>industry</a>.
The cluster of technology-companies around Christchurch has led to the name &quot;<a>Silicon Plains</a>&quot; for the area.</p>
<p>In 2010 <a>QS World University Rankings</a>&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; ranked the University of Canterbury 189th overall in the world, making it the third highest ranked university in New Zealand.
Its individual global subject rankings were: 212th in Arts &amp; Humanities, 110th in Engineering &amp; IT, 242nd in Natural Sciences, and 152nd in Social Sciences.</p>
<p>, the University had a total of 22,403 students, 1,881 of them post-graduates and 2,168 international students (students apart from New Zealand <a>citizen</a>s or residents).
The University employed 603 academic staff and 1069 general staff.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The <a>University of Canterbury Students' Association</a> (UCSA)&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; operates on campus with its own radio station (<a>RDU</a>) and magazine (<a><em>Canta</em></a>).
The popular on-campus bar, &quot;The Foundry&quot;, known as &quot;The Common Room&quot; from 2005, has reverted to its former name as promised by 2008 USCA president, Michael Goldstein.</p>
<p>The University has over 100 academic, sporting, recreational and cultural societies and clubs.
The most prominent of these include the <a>University of Canterbury Engineering Society (ENSOC)</a>, the Law Society (LAWSOC), the Commerce Society (UCom), as well as the largest non-faculty clubs such as BYCSOC (Backyard Cricket Society), CUBA (<a>Canterbury University Boardriders' Association</a>), CurrySoc, <a>The Gentlemen's Club</a>, and <a>KAOS</a> (Killing As Organised Sport).
The <a>University of Canterbury Drama Society</a> (Dramasoc) achieved fame for its 1942-1969 Shakespeare productions under Dame <a>Ngaio Marsh</a>, but regularly performs as an active student- and alumni-run arts fixture in the small Christchurch theatre-scene.
The 2007 event gained international news coverage (including on <a>CNN</a> and <a>BBC World</a>) when it ended in rioting in the student quarter of <a>Dunedin</a> and in <a>North East Valley</a>.
ENSOC cancelled the planned 2008 event: its future now seems murky.</p>
<p>[[File:Arts Center Christchurch.JPG|thumb|right|Former University of Canterbury campus in the city centre, today the [[Christchurch Arts Centre]]]]</p>
<p>The University originated in 1873 in the centre of <a>Christchurch</a> as Canterbury College, the first constituent <a>college</a> of the <a>University of New Zealand</a>.
It became the second institution in <a>New Zealand</a> providing tertiary-level <a>education</a> (following the <a>University of Otago</a>, established in 1869), and the fourth in <a>Australasia</a>.
In 1933, the name changed from <em>Canterbury College</em> to <em>Canterbury University College</em>.
In 1957 the name changed again to the present <em>University of Canterbury</em>.</p>
<p>Until 1961, the University formed part of the <a>University of New Zealand</a> (UNZ), and issued degrees in its name.
That year saw the dissolution of the federal system of tertiary education in New Zealand, and the University of Canterbury became an independent University awarding its own degrees.
Upon the UNZ's demise, <a>Canterbury Agricultural College</a> became a constituent college of the University of Canterbury, as <em>Lincoln College</em>.&lt;ref&gt;[<a>http://www.lincoln.ac.nz/story_images/952_LincolnUniversity_s3422.pdf</a> &lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln College became independent in 1990 as a full university in its own right.</p>
<p>Over the period from 1961 to 1974, the university campus relocated from the centre of the city to its much larger current site in the suburb of Ilam.
The <a>neo-gothic</a> buildings of the old campus became the site of the <a>Christchurch Arts Centre</a>, a hub for arts, crafts and entertainment in Christchurch.</p>
<p>For many years the university worked closely with the Christchurch College of Education, leading to a full merger in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<h2>Coat of arms</h2>
<p>With the dissolution of the University of New Zealand, the newly independent University of Canterbury devised its own coat of arms, <a>blazoned</a>: :<em>&quot;murrey a fleece argent, in base a plough or, and on a chief wavy or an open book proper bound murrey, edged and clasped or between a pall azure charged with four crosses formy fitchy or and a cross flory azure.&quot;</em>
This replaced the arms formerly used by Canterbury College &#x2014; an unofficial, simplified version of the <a>Canterbury Province</a> coat of arms.
<p>As it relates to an institution of learning, the University's coat of arms does not have a helmet, crest or mantling on its bearings.</p>
<p>A more detailed history of the arms, including their formal heraldic description, appears on the University <a>website</a>.</p>
<p>The University was awarded the 2006 <a>Cycle Friendly Award</a> for the best cycle-friendly commitment by a public organisation in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
