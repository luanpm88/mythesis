<p>The <strong>University of California, Berkeley</strong> (also referred to as <strong>Cal</strong>, <strong>California</strong>, <strong>Berkeley</strong> and <strong>UC Berkeley</strong>) is a <a>public research university</a> located in <a>Berkeley, California</a>, <a>United States</a>, in the San Francisco Bay Area.
The oldest of the ten major campuses affiliated with the <a>University of California</a>, the University was founded in 1868 in a merger of the private <a>College of California</a> and the public Agricultural, Mining, and Mechanical Arts College.
<p>Berkeley offers around 300 undergraduate and <a>graduate degree</a> programs in a wide range of disciplines, and the university has the highest number of graduate programs ranked in the top 10 in their fields by the <a>United States National Research Council</a>.
Among other distinctions, University faculty, alumni, and researchers have won 66 <a>Nobel Prize</a>s, 9 <a>Wolf Prize</a>s, 7 <a>Fields Medal</a>s, 12 <a>Turing Award</a>s, 43 <a>MacArthur Fellowship</a>s, 19 <a>Academy Award</a>s, and 11 <a>Pulitzer Prize</a>s.</p>
A member of both the <a>Pacific-10 Conference</a> and the <a>Mountain Pacific Sports Federation</a> in the <a>NCAA</a>, Cal students have won national titles in many sports, including football, men's basketball, baseball, men's gymnastics, softball, water polo, rugby, and crew.
<p>Berkeley was a founding member of the <a>Association of American Universities</a>.
Since that time, the university has managed or co-managed the <a>Los Alamos National Laboratory</a>, as well as the <a>Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a> and <a>Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</a> for the <a>U.S.
Department of Energy</a>.</p>
<p>In 1866, the land comprising the current Berkeley campus was purchased by the private <a>College of California</a>.
Because it lacked sufficient funds to operate, it eventually merged with the state-run Agricultural, Mining, and Mechanical Arts College to form the <a>University of California</a>, the first full-curriculum public university in the state of California.
<a>Andrew Gabrielson</a> was a trustee of the College of California and suggested that the college be named in honor of the <a>Anglo-Irish</a> philosopher <a>George Berkeley</a>.&lt;ref
name=&quot;Berkeley&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1870 <a>Henry Durant</a>, the founder of the College of California, became the first president.
With the completion of North and <a>South Halls</a> in 1873, the university relocated to its Berkeley location with 167 male and 222 female students and held its first classes.&lt;ref
<p>Beginning in 1891, <a>Phoebe Apperson Hearst</a> made several large gifts to Berkeley, funding a number of programs and new buildings, and sponsoring, in 1898, an international competition in Antwerp, Belgium, where French architect Emile Bernard submitted the winning design for a campus master plan.
In 1905, the University Farm was established near <a>Sacramento</a>, ultimately becoming the <a>University of California, Davis</a>.&lt;ref
name=&quot;ucb_about&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1920s, the number of campus buildings had grown substantially, and included twenty structures designed by architect <a>John Galen Howard</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p><a>Robert Gordon Sproul</a> served as president from 1930 to 1958.&lt;ref name=&quot;Presidents&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; By 1942, the American Council on Education ranked UC Berkeley second only to <a>Harvard University</a> in the number of distinguished departments.&lt;ref
<p>During <a>World War II</a>, following <a>Glenn Seaborg</a>'s then-secret discovery of plutonium, <a>Ernest Orlando Lawrence</a>'s <a>Radiation Laboratory</a> began to contract with the <a>U.S. Army</a> to develop the <a>atomic bomb</a>.
In 1917, Cal's ROTC program was established, and its School of Military Aeronautics trained future pilots, including <a>Jimmy Doolittle</a>, who graduated with a B.A. in 1922.
Both <a>Robert McNamara</a> and <a>Frederick C. Weyand</a> graduated from Cal's ROTC program, earning B.A. degrees in 1937 and 1938, respectively.
<p>In 1952, the University of California became an entity separate from the Berkeley campus.
Each campus was given relative autonomy and its own Chancellor.
Then-president Sproul assumed presidency of the entire University of California system, and <a>Clark Kerr</a> became the first Chancellor of UC Berkeley.&lt;ref
In the highly publicized <a>People's Park</a> protest in 1969, students and the school conflicted over use of a plot of land; the <a>National Guard</a> was called in and violence erupted.&lt;ref
Democrats outnumber Republicans on the faculty by a ratio of 9:1.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<a>Native American</a>s conflicted with the school over repatriation of remains from the Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;
<p>The original name <em>University of California</em> was frequently shortened to <em>California</em> or <em>Cal</em>.
Today <em>University of California</em> refers to a statewide school system and the official name is <em>University of California, Berkeley</em>, frequently shortened to <em>UC Berkeley</em>, <em>Berkeley</em>, <em>Cal.</em>
In addition, the University also owns land to the northwest of the main campus, a married student housing complex in the nearby town of Albany (&quot;Albany Village&quot; and the &quot;Gill Tract&quot;), and a field research station several miles to the north in <a>Richmond, California</a>.
Outside of the Bay Area, the University owns various research laboratories and research forests in both northern and southern Sierra Nevada.</p>
<p>[[Image:South Hall--UC Berkeley--Panoramic.jpg|thumb|left|[[South Hall (UC Berkeley)|South Hall]] (1873), one of the two original buildings of the University of California, still stands on the Berkeley campus]] What is considered the historic campus today was the result of the 1898 &quot;International Competition for the <a>Phoebe Hearst</a> Architectural Plan for the University of California,&quot; funded by <a>William Randolph Hearst</a>'s mother and initially held in the Belgian city of <a>Antwerp</a>; eleven finalists were judged again in San Francisco in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Online
Exhibit on the Hearst Architectural Competition</a>&lt;/ref&gt; The winner was Frenchman <a>&#x00c9;mile B&#x00e9;nard</a>, however he refused to personally supervise the implementation of his plan and the task was subsequently given to architecture professor <a>John Galen Howard</a>.
Howard designed over twenty buildings, which set the tone for the campus up until its expansion in the 1950s and 1960s.
The structures forming the &#x201c;classical core&#x201d; of the campus were built in the <a>Beaux-Arts</a> Classical style, and include <a>Hearst Greek Theatre</a>, <a>Hearst Memorial Mining Building</a>, <a>Doe Memorial Library</a>, California Hall, <a>Wheeler Hall</a>, (Old) Le Conte Hall, Gilman Hall, Haviland Hall, Wellman Hall, <a>Sather Gate</a>, and the <a>Sather Tower</a> (nicknamed &quot;the Campanile&quot; after its architectural inspiration, <a>St Mark's Campanile</a> in Venice).
Buildings he regarded as temporary, nonacademic, or not particularly &quot;serious&quot; were designed in shingle or <a>Collegiate Gothic</a> styles; examples of these are North Gate Hall, Dwinelle Annex, and Stephens Hall.
It, and the <a>Frederick Law Olmsted</a>-designed <a>Piedmont Avenue</a> east of the main campus, are the only remnants from the original University of California before John Galen Howard's buildings were constructed.

The north fork appears just east of <a>University House</a> and runs through the glade north of the Valley Life Sciences Building, the original site of the Campus Arboretum.</p>
<p>Trees in the area date from the founding of the University in the 1870s.
The &quot;treesit&quot; protest revolved around the controversy of clearing away trees by the stadium to build the new Student Athlete High Performance Center.
As the stadium sits directly on the fault, this raised campus concerns of the safety of student athletes in the event of an earthquake as they train in facilities under the stadium stands.&lt;ref&gt;<a>&quot;Campus
Presently, the university offers two years of guaranteed housing for entering freshmen, and one year for entering transfer students.
Because of their communal design and location in the city, these residence halls tend to be the more social of the housing options.
House</a>&lt;/ref&gt; Farther away from campus is Clark Kerr, a residence hall complex that houses many student athletes and was once a school for the deaf and blind.
Because of their proximity to the <a>College of Engineering</a> and <a>College of Chemistry</a>, these residence halls often house science and engineering majors.
They tend to be quieter than the <a>southside</a> complexes, but because of their location next to the theatre, often get free glimpses of concerts.
University Village is located three miles (5&nbsp;km) north-west of campus in <a>Albany, California</a>.
The Village Residents Association, a funding and advocacy group in University Village, filmed a video documentary regarding the lack of affordable student family housing in June, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Affordable

The University of California is governed by a 26-member <a>Board of Regents</a>, 18 of which are appointed by the <a>Governor of California</a> to 12-year terms, 7 serving as <em><a>ex officio</a></em> members, and a single student regent.&lt;ref

<p>Overlooking the main Berkeley campus from the foothills in the east, <a>The Big &quot;C&quot;</a> is an important symbol of California school spirit.
It was eventually decided to discontinue Rush and, in 1905, the freshman and sophomore classes banded together in a show of unity to build the Big &quot;C&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Days of Cal | Bear Traditions&lt;!--
Bot generated title --&gt;</a>&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to its prominent position, the Big &quot;C&quot; is often the target of pranks by rival <a>Stanford University</a> students who paint the Big &quot;C&quot; red and also fraternities and sororities who paint it their organization's colors.
Then known as Bleacher Stunts, they were first performed during the 1910 <a>Big Game</a> and consisted of two stunts: a picture of the <a>Stanford Axe</a> and a large blue &quot;C&quot; on a white background.
First used in the 1963 Big Game, it was originally placed on the sidelines before moving to <a>Tightwad Hill</a> in 1971.
<p>A few current traditions include streaking during finals week in the Main Stacks, the Happy Happy Man, and <a>Stoney Burke</a>.</p>
<p>[[Image:Cal band.JPG|thumb|Cal Straw Hat Band (a smaller subset of the Cal Band) playing at [[SeaWorld San Diego|SeaWorld]] in <a>San Diego, California</a>]] UC Berkeley has over 700 established student groups.</p>
Today, Berkeley is known as a lively campus with activism in many forms, from email petitions, presentations on <a>Sproul Plaza</a> and volunteering, to the occasional protest.
Political student groups on campus numbered 94 during the 2006&#x2013;2007 school year, including Berkeley MEChA, Berkeley <a>ACLU</a>, Berkeley Students for Life, Campus Greens, Cal Berkeley Democrats, and the Berkeley College Republicans.
<p>The <a>IDEAL Scholars Fund</a> was established by four alumni to increase the number of underrepresented minorities at UC Berkeley.
The Fund tries to counter the perceived effects of California <a>Proposition 209</a>, which ended <a>Affirmative Action</a> in <a>California</a> and in the <a>University of California</a> system.
Some claimed there was a reduction in the numbers of Latino, African American and Native American students and rekindled their activism on campus concerning issues of race.
However, supporters of <a>Proposition 209</a> have noted that the number of Asian American students, a small minority group nationally but a large minority group in California, has dramatically increased following its passage.

<p>UC Berkeley's student-run online television station, <a>CalTV</a>, was formed in 2005 and broadcasts online.
Every year, the team competes in the <a>National Student Advertising Competition</a>.
Students from various backgrounds come together to work on a marketing case provided by the AAF and a corporate sponsor to college chapters across the nation.
Most recently, the UC Berkeley team won in their respective regions in both 2005 and 2009, eventually going on to win 4th and 3rd in the nation, respectively.</p>
DeCal arose out of the 1960s <a>Free Speech movement</a> and was officially established in 1981.

<p> Cal's sports teams compete in intercollegiate athletics as the <a>California Golden Bears</a>.
They participate in the <a>NCAA</a>'s Division I-A as a member of the <a>Pacific-10 Conference</a>.
The official school colors, established in 1873 by a committee of students, are Yale Blue and California Gold.&lt;ref name=&quot;Resource Guide: Student history&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Yale Blue was chosen because many of the university's founders were <a>Yale University</a> graduates (for example Henry Durant, the first university president), while California Gold was selected to represent the Golden State of California.
Cal has a long history of excellence in athletics, having won national titles in football, men's basketball, baseball, softball, men's and women's crew, men's gymnastics, men's tennis, men's and women's swimming, men's water polo, men's Judo, men's track, and men's rugby.
In addition, Cal athletes have won numerous individual NCAA titles in track, gymnastics, swimming and tennis.
On January 31, 2009, the school's <a>Hurling</a> club made athletic history by defeating <a>Stanford</a> in the first collegiate hurling match ever to be played on American soil.</p>
California finished in ninth place&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; in the 2006-07 U.S. Sports Academy Directors' Cup.
Following the end of the 2008 season, California accepted an invitation to play the <a>University of Miami</a> in the December 27 <a>Emerald Bowl</a>.</p>
Since 1933, the winner of the Big Game has been awarded custody of <a>the Stanford Axe</a>.</p>
<p>One of the most famous moments in Big Game history occurred during the 85th Big Game on November 20, 1982.
In what has become known as &quot;the band play&quot; or simply <a>The Play</a>, Cal scored the winning touchdown in the final seconds with a kickoff return that involved a series of laterals and the Stanford marching band rushing onto the field.</p>
<p>Berkeley teams have won national championships in baseball (2), men's basketball (2), men's crew (15), women's crew (3), football (8), men's golf (1), men's gymnastics (4), men's lacrosse (1), men's rugby (24), softball (1), men's swimming (2), women's swimming (1), men's tennis (1), men's track &amp; field (1), and men's water polo (13).</p>

Unix worked so well that <a>DARPA</a> chose it to be the preferred 'universal computing environment' linking together <a>Arpanet</a> research nodes, thus setting in place an essential piece of infrastructure for the later growth of the Internet.
An entire generation of computer scientists cut their teeth on Berkeley Unix.
Peter Deutsch</a>&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch was awarded a 1992 citation by the <a>Association for Computing Machinery</a> for his work on <a>Interlisp</a>()&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L.
Peter Deutsch is profiled in pages 69, 70-72, 118, 146, 227, 230, 280, 399 of the following book: &lt;/ref&gt; (PhD 1973), <a>Butler Lampson</a> (PhD 1967), and <a>Charles P. Thacker</a> (BS 1967)&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; worked with Ken Thompson on <a>Project Genie</a> and then formed the ill-fated <a>US Department of Defense</a>-funded Berkeley Computer Corporation (BCC), which was scattered throughout the Berkeley campus in non-descript offices to avoid anti-war protestors.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
After BCC failed, Deutsch, Lampson, and Thacker joined <a>Xerox PARC</a>, where they developed a number of pioneering computer technologies, culminating in the <a>Xerox Alto</a> that inspired the <a>Apple Macintosh</a>.

<p>The <a>XCF</a>, an undergraduate research group located in <a>Soda Hall</a>, has been responsible for a number of notable software projects, including <a>GTK+</a> (created by <a>Peter Mattis</a>, BS 1997), <a>The GIMP</a> (<a>Spencer Kimball</a>, BS 1996), and the initial diagnosis of the <a>Morris worm</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
ViolaWWW was the first browser to have embedded scriptable objects, stylesheets, and tables.
In the spirit of Open Source, he donated the code to Sun Microsystems, inspiring <a>Java</a> applets( <a>Kim Polese</a> (BS 1984) was the original product manager for Java at Sun Microsystems.)
ViolaWWW also inspired researchers at the <a>National Center for Supercomputing Applications</a> to create the <a>Mosaic web browser</a>,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; a pioneering <a>web browser</a> that became Microsoft <a>Internet Explorer</a>.</p>
