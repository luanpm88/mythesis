To the west of the central campus is the <a>downtown business district of Berkeley</a>; to the northwest is the neighborhood of North Berkeley, including the so-called <a>Gourmet Ghetto</a>, a commercial district known for high quality dining due to the presence of such world-renowned restaurants as <a>Chez Panisse</a>.
Immediately to the north is a quiet residential neighborhood known as <a>Northside</a> with a large graduate student population; situated north of that are the upscale residential neighborhoods of the <a>Berkeley Hills</a>, where many faculty members live.
The <a>area south of the university</a> includes student housing and <a>Telegraph Avenue</a>, one of Berkeley's main shopping districts with stores, street vendors and restaurants catering to college students and tourists.
Other architects whose work can be found in the campus and surrounding area are <a>Bernard Maybeck</a>&lt;ref name=mccoy&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (best known for the <a>Palace of Fine Arts</a> in San Francisco), Maybeck's student <a>Julia Morgan</a> (Hearst Women's Gymnasium), <a>Charles Willard Moore</a> (<a>Haas School of Business</a>) and <a>Joseph Esherick</a> (Wurster Hall).</p>

<p> UC Berkeley's student housing accommodates a variety of personal and academic preferences and styles.

Foothill is a co-ed suite-style hall reminiscent of a Swiss chalet.
Dedicated in 1929 and on the <a>National Register of Historic Places</a>, this all-men's residence hall has large quad-occupancy rooms and has the appearance of a castle.</p>
<p>Family student housing consists of two main groups of housing: <a>University Village</a> and Smyth-Fernwald.
The demolition of older buildings and their subsequent replacement with new, more expensive apartment units has prompted student protests.
