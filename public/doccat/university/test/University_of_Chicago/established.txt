It was founded by the <a>American Baptist Education Society</a> with a donation from oil magnate and philanthropist <a>John D. Rockefeller</a> and incorporated in 1890.
<a>William Rainey Harper</a> became the university's first president, in 1891, and the first classes were held in 1892.
It has a reputation of devotion to academic scholarship and <a>intellectualism</a>&lt;ref name=&quot;columbia&quot;&gt; &quot;The University of Chicago was founded in 1892, and within a short time became internationally recognized as one of the world's great centers of scholarship, research, and teaching.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref
<p>The University consists of the <a>College of the University of Chicago</a>, various graduate programs and interdisciplinary committees organized into four divisions, six <a>professional school</a>s, and a school of <a>continuing education</a>.
name=&quot;nsf&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; University of Chicago scholars have played a role in the development of the <a>Chicago School of economics</a>, the <a>Chicago School of sociology</a>, the <a>law and economics</a> movement in legal analysis,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and the physics leading to <a>the world's first man-made, self-sustaining</a> <a>nuclear reaction</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
<p>The University of Chicago was created and <a>incorporated</a> as a <a>coeducational</a>,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; secular institution in 1890 by the <a>American Baptist Education Society</a> and a donation from oil magnate and philanthropist <a>John D. Rockefeller</a>.
It emerged from a <a>Baptist university of the same name</a> that had closed in 1886 due to financial difficulties.
<a>William Rainey Harper</a> became the modern University's first president on July 1, 1891, and the first classes were held on October 1, 1892.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The <a>business school</a> was founded in 1898,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and the <a>law school</a> was founded in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Harper died in 1906,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and was replaced by a series of three presidents whose tenures lasted until 1929.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
During this period, the <a>Oriental Institute</a> was founded.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>In 1929, the University's fifth president, <a>Robert Maynard Hutchins</a>, took office; the University underwent many changes during his 24-year tenure.
Hutchins eliminated varsity football from the University in an attempt to deemphasize athletics over academics,&lt;ref name=&quot;hutchins&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; instituted the undergraduate college's liberal-arts curriculum known as the <a>Common Core</a>,&lt;ref name=&quot;core&quot; /&gt; and organized the University's graduate work into its current four divisions.&lt;ref
name=&quot;hutchins&quot; /&gt; In 1933, Hutchins proposed an unsuccessful plan to merge the University of Chicago and <a>Northwestern University</a> into a single university.&lt;ref
name=&quot;merger&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; During his term, the University of Chicago Hospitals (now called the <a>University of Chicago Medical Center</a>) finished construction and enrolled its first medical students,&lt;ref name=&quot;hospitalhistory&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and the <a>Committee on Social Thought</a> was created.</p>

Money that had been raised during the 1920s and financial backing from the <a>Rockefeller Foundation</a> helped the school to survive through the <a>Great Depression</a>.&lt;ref
name=&quot;hutchins&quot; /&gt; During <a>World War II</a>, the University made important contributions to the <a>Manhattan Project</a>.&lt;ref
name=&quot;manhattan&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The University was the site of the first isolation of <a>plutonium</a> and of the creation of the first artificial, self-sustained nuclear reaction by <a>Enrico Fermi</a> in 1942.&lt;ref
In response, the University became a major sponsor of a controversial <a>urban renewal</a> project for Hyde Park, which profoundly affected both the neighborhood's architecture and street plan.
For details of this urban renewal effort, see <a>Hyde Park</a>.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer,
John W. &quot;The Kind of University That We Desire to Become&quot;, Annual Report to the Faculty of the College (October 28, 2008).
<p>The University experienced its share of student unrest during the 1960s, beginning in 1962, when students occupied President George Beadle's office in a protest over the University's off-campus rental policies.
<p>In 1978, <a>Hanna Holborn Gray</a>, then the provost and acting president of <a>Yale University</a>, became President of the University of Chicago, in which capacity she served for 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
When <em><a>The New York Times</a></em>, <em><a>The Economist</a></em>, and other major news outlets picked up this story, the University became the focal point of a national debate on education.
<p>In the past decade, the University began a number of multi-million dollar expansion projects.
In 2008, the University of Chicago announced plans to establish the <a>Milton Friedman Institute</a>.
Current construction projects include: the Jules and Gwen Knapp Center for Biomedical Discovery, a ten-story medical research center, as well as further additions to the medical campus of the <a>University of Chicago Medical Center</a>.&lt;ref
older buildings of the University of Chicago employ [[Collegiate Gothic]] architecture like that of the <a>University of Oxford</a>.
<p>The main campus of the University of Chicago consists of in the Chicago neighborhoods of <a>Hyde Park</a> and <a>Woodlawn</a>, seven miles (11&nbsp;km) south of <a>downtown Chicago</a>.
<p>The first buildings of the University of Chicago campus, which make up what is now known as the Main Quadrangles, were part of a &quot;master plan&quot; conceived by two University of Chicago trustees and plotted by Chicago architect <a>Henry Ives Cobb</a>.&lt;ref
<p>After the 1940s, the Collegiate Gothic style on campus began to give way to modern styles.&lt;ref
name=&quot;famousbldgs&quot; /&gt; In 1955, <a>Eero Saarinen</a> was contracted to develop a second master plan, which led to the construction of buildings both north and south of the Midway, including the Laird Bell Law Quadrangle (a complex designed by Saarinen);&lt;ref name=&quot;famousbldgs&quot;/&gt; a series of arts buildings;&lt;ref name=&quot;famousbldgs&quot;/&gt; a building designed by <a>Ludwig Mies van der Rohe</a> for the University's School of Social Service Administration;&lt;ref name=&quot;famousbldgs&quot;/&gt; and the <a>Regenstein Library</a>, the largest building on campus, a <a>brutalist</a> structure designed by <a>Walter Netsch</a> of the Chicago firm <a>Skidmore, Owings and Merrill</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
<a>Robie House</a>, a <a>Frank Lloyd Wright</a> building acquired by the University in 1963, is also a National Historic Landmark,&lt;ref&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; as is room 405 of the <a>George Herbert Jones Laboratory</a>, where <a>Glenn T. Seaborg</a> and his team were the first to isolate plutonium.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
<p>The University of Chicago also maintains facilities apart from its main campus.
The University's <a>Booth School of Business</a> maintains campuses in <a>Singapore</a>, <a>London</a>, and the downtown <a>Streeterville</a> neighborhood of Chicago.
The Center in Paris, a campus located on the <a>left bank</a> of the <a>Seine</a> in Paris, hosts various undergraduate and graduate study programs.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The University of Chicago also opened a new center in Beijing in fall 2010.</p>
<p>The University of Chicago is governed by a board of trustees.
The Board of Trustees oversees the long-term development and plans of the University and manages fundraising efforts, and is composed of 50 members including the University President.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
<p>The University's endowment was the 11th largest among American educational institutions and state university systems in 2008&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and as of July 2010 is valued at $5.578 billion.&lt;ref
<p>The academic bodies of the University of Chicago consist of the <a>College</a>, four divisions of graduate research, six professional schools, and the Graham School of General Studies (a <a>continuing education</a> school).
The University is accredited by <a>The Higher Learning Commission</a> of the <a>North Central Association of Colleges and Schools</a>.&lt;ref
The school year typically begins in late September and ends in mid-June.&lt;ref
<p> The College of the University of Chicago grants <a>Bachelor of Arts</a> and <a>Bachelor of Science</a> degrees in 49 <a>academic major</a>s and 22 minors.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
name=&quot;collegiatedivisions&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The first four are sections within their corresponding graduate divisions, while the New Collegiate Division administers interdisciplinary majors and studies which do not fit in one of the other four divisions.&lt;ref
name=&quot;curriculum2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; As of the 2009&#x2013;2010 school year, 15&nbsp;courses, tested proficiency in a foreign language, passage of a swim test, and up to three physical education courses (depending on results of an entrance examination) are required under the Core.&lt;ref
In the spring quarter of 2009, the University enrolled 3,633 graduate students: 485 in the Biological Sciences Division, 1,076 in the Humanities Division, 732 in the Physical Sciences Division, and 1,340 in the Social Sciences Division.&lt;ref
<p>The University contains six professional schools: the <a>Pritzker School of Medicine</a> (which is a part of the Biological Sciences Division), the <a>Booth School of Business</a>, the <a>Law School</a>, the <a>Divinity School</a>, the <a>Harris School of Public Policy Studies</a>, and the <a>School of Social Service Administration</a> (SSA).
The total enrollment for these six professional schools was 5,086 students in the 2009 spring quarter: 2,878 students in the business school, 344 in the Divinity School, 452 in the medical school, 269 in the Harris School, 494 in SSA, and 649 in the Law School.&lt;ref

<p>In fiscal year 2006, the University of Chicago spent US$305,301,000 on scientific research.&lt;ref
<p>The University operates 12 research institutes and 113 research centers on campus.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The University partially manages <a>Argonne National Laboratory</a>, part of the <a>United States Department of Energy</a>'s national laboratory system, and has a joint stake in <a>Fermilab</a>, a nearby particle physics laboratory, as well as a stake in the <a>Apache Point Observatory</a> in <a>Sunspot, New Mexico</a>.
<p>The University of Chicago has been the site of some important experiments and academic movements.
In economics, the University has played an important role in shaping ideas about the <a>free market</a>&lt;ref&gt;Kasper, Sherryl (2002) <em>The Revival of Laissez-Faire in American Macroeconomic Theory: A Case Study of Its Pioneers</em>.
ISBN 1-84064-606-3&lt;/ref&gt; and is the namesake of the <a>Chicago school of economics</a>, the school of economic thought supported by <a>Milton Friedman</a> and other economists.
The University's <a>sociology</a> department was the first independent sociology department in the United States and gave birth to the <a>Chicago school of sociology</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
In physics, the University was the site of the <a>Chicago Pile-1</a> (the first self-sustained man-made nuclear reaction, part of the <a>Manhattan Project</a>), of <a>Robert Millikan</a>'s <a>oil-drop experiment</a> that calculated the charge of the electron,&lt;ref name=&quot;oildrop&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and of the development of <a>radiocarbon dating</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p> There have been 85&nbsp;Nobel Laureates affiliated with the University of Chicago,&lt;ref name=&quot;uchicago1&quot;/&gt; 17 of whom were pursuing research or on faculty at the University at the time of the award announcement.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
