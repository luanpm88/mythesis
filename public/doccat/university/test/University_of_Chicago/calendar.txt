<p>In the early 1950s, student applications declined as a result of increasing crime and poverty in the Hyde Park neighborhood.
After the sit-in ended, when Dixon turned down a one-year reappointment, 42 students were expelled and 81 were suspended,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the most severe response to student occupations of any American university during the student movement.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
The institute will cost around $200 million and occupy the buildings of the <a>Chicago Theological Seminary</a>.
<p>A recent two billion dollar campaign has brought substantial expansion to the campus, including the unveiling of the <a>Max Palevsky Residential Commons</a>, the South Campus Residence Hall, the <a>Gerald Ratner Athletics Center</a>, a new hospital, and a new science building.
The northern and southern portions of campus are separated by the <a>Midway Plaisance</a>, a large, linear park created for the 1893 <a>World's Columbian Exposition</a>.</p>

Chicago also operates or is affiliated with a number of research institutions apart from the university proper.
Faculty and students at the adjacent <a>Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago</a> collaborate with the University,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and although formally unrelated, the <a>National Opinion Research Center</a> is located on campus.</p>
<p>In addition, many Chicago alumni and scholars have won the <a>Fulbright awards</a>&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and 44 have matriculated as <a>Rhodes Scholars</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>

<h3>Fraternities and sororities</h3>
<p> On-campus undergraduate students at the University of Chicago participate in a <a>house system</a> in which each student is assigned to one of the university's 10 <a>residence hall</a> buildings and to a smaller community within their residence hall called a &quot;house&quot;.
There are 36 houses, with an average of 70 students in each house&lt;ref name=&quot;collegehousing&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Freshmen are required to participate in the house system, and housing is guaranteed every year thereafter.&lt;ref
