staff$$$@@@%%%<p><a>left|thumb|250px|Highland Park campus, 1904.</a></p>
image_size$$$@@@%%%<h3>Origin</h3>
staff$$$@@@%%%<p>Occidental College was founded on April 20, 1887, by a group of <a>Presbyterian</a> clergy and laymen, including <a>James George Bell</a>.
postgrad$$$@@@%%%The college&#x2019;s first term began a year later with 27 men and 13 women students, and tuition of $50 a year.
staff$$$@@@%%%Initially located in <a>Boyle Heights</a>, the college moved to a new campus in Los Angeles&#x2019; <a>Highland Park</a> neighborhood in 1898.
established$$$@@@%%%Despite a strong Presbyterian presence on its campus, Occidental cut ties to the church in 1910.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1912, the school began construction of a new campus located in Los Angeles&#x2019; Eagle Rock neighborhood.
website$$$@@@%%%The Eagle Rock campus was to be designed by noted California Architect <a>Myron Hunt</a>.
staff$$$@@@%%%That same year, Occidental President <a>John Willis Baer</a> announced the trustees&#x2019; decision to convert Oxy into an all-men&#x2019;s institution.
postgrad$$$@@@%%%However, students protested, and the idea was abandoned.</p>
website$$$@@@%%%<h3>Move to Eagle Rock</h3>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Two weeks after <a>Booker T. Washington</a> came to visit Occidental, on March 27, 1914 &#x2014; the school&#x2019;s 25th anniversary, Swan, Fowler, and Johnson halls were dedicated at its new Eagle Rock campus.
nickname$$$@@@%%%The Eagle Rock campus covers over 120 acres (0.5&nbsp;km), much of which is undeveloped land on a hill known as &#x201c;Mt.
image_size$$$@@@%%%Fiji.&#x201d;
calendar$$$@@@%%%In April 1917, the college formed an Army Corps to aid the war effort.
established$$$@@@%%%The college opened its Hillside Theatre in 1925, and a student union in 1928.
postgrad$$$@@@%%%During <a>World War II</a>, many students left Occidental to fight in the war.
postgrad$$$@@@%%%In July 1943, 53 students established a Navy V-12 unit on campus and left for active duty.</p>
image_size$$$@@@%%%<h3>&quot;A little giant&quot;</h3>
staff$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1962, <em><a>Time Magazine</a></em> described Occidental as a little giant in a story about the college&#x2019;s rise to national prominence.
established$$$@@@%%%Indeed, this moniker was characteristic of the college&#x2019;s growth.</p>
free_label$$$@@@%%%<p>During the late 1960s, a strong anti-war sentiment made its presence felt at Occidental.
nickname$$$@@@%%%The students&#x2019; activism was characteristic of a rise of <a>liberalism</a> across campus.
staff$$$@@@%%%In 1969, the school opened its first two co-ed <a>dormitories</a>, and two more followed a year later.
established$$$@@@%%%On May 6, 1970, the faculty voted to suspend classes in the wake of the <a>Kent State shootings</a> and America&#x2019;s invasion of Cambodia.
postgrad$$$@@@%%%Subsequently, Oxy students wrote 7,000 letters to Washington D.C., protesting U.S. involvement in the war in Southeast Asia.</p>
staff$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1979, Occidental installed <em>Water Forms II</em> (see <a>image below</a>), a kinetic fountain designed by professor George Baker.
free_label$$$@@@%%%The fountain is a campus landmark and was featured prominently in the 1984 film <em><a>Star Trek III: The Search for Spock</a></em>.
free_label$$$@@@%%%During the <a>1984 Olympic Games</a>, some track events were held at Occidental&#x2019;s Patterson Field.
staff$$$@@@%%%By 1986, for the first time since <a>World War II</a>, women students outnumbered men.
calendar$$$@@@%%%Today, the college is approximately 60 percent female and 40 percent male; roughly equivalent to the national average.
image_size$$$@@@%%%On July 1, 2006, Susan Prager became Occidental's first female president.
established$$$@@@%%%She then left her position in 2007 during the fall term.
staff$$$@@@%%%On July 1, 2009, <a>Jonathan Veitch</a>, formerly dean of <a>The New School</a>'s <a>Eugene Lang College</a>, became Occidental's 15th president, and the first to be a native <a>Angeleno</a>.</p>

established$$$@@@%%%The Arthur G. Coons Administration Building has been dubbed &quot;the Chrysler Showroom&quot; by campus wags &#x2014; a reference to its boxy glass lobby.
mottoeng$$$@@@%%%As the seat of power, Coons has also been compared to Foucault's &quot;panopticon.&quot;
established$$$@@@%%%The most notable aberration, however, is Stearns Hall, which has been described as &quot;Barbie meets <a>Escher</a>&quot; for its angular, post-modern style and its shrunken scale (it is supposedly built at 90% of scale, an idea supported by the feeling of <a>claustrophobia</a> often encountered there).
