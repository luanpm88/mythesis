The University grew rapidly from 1167 when <a>Henry II</a> banned English students from attending the <a>University of Paris</a>.
The two &quot;ancient universities&quot; have many common features and are often jointly referred to as <em><a>Oxbridge</a></em>.

<p>The University of Oxford does not have a clear date of foundation.
The women's colleges were only given full collegiate status in 1959.
The academic departments are located centrally within this structure; they are not affiliated with any particular college.
The members of an academic department are spread around many colleges; though certain colleges do have subject alignments (e.g.

<p>The university's formal head is the <a>Chancellor</a> (currently <a>Lord Patten of Barnes</a>), though as with most British universities, the Chancellor is a titular figure, rather than someone involved with the day-to-day running of the university.
The Chancellor is elected by the members of <a>Convocation</a>, a body comprising all graduates of the university, and holds office until death.</p>
<p>The <a>Vice-Chancellor</a>, currently <a>Andrew Hamilton</a>, is the &quot;de facto&quot; head of the University.
<p>Two university <a>proctors</a>, who are elected annually on a rotating basis from two of the colleges, are the internal ombudsmen who make sure that the university and its members adhere to its statutes.
The collection of University Professors is called the Statutory Professors of the University of Oxford.
They are particularly influential in the running of the graduate programmes within the University.
Examples of Statutory Professors are the <a>Chichele Professorship</a>s and the Drummond Professor of Political Economy.
The various academic faculties, departments, and institutes are organised into four divisions, each with their own Head and elected board.
College]], one of the constituent colleges of the University of Oxford]] There are 38 <a>colleges of the University of Oxford</a> and 6 <a>Permanent Private Hall</a>s, each with its own internal structure and activities.
The heads of Oxford colleges are known by various titles, according to the college, including warden, provost, principal, president, rector, master or dean.
These tutorials are complemented by lectures, classes and seminars, which are organised on a departmental basis.
The first set of examinations, called either Honour Moderations (&quot;Mods&quot; and &quot;Honour Mods&quot;) or Preliminary Examinations (&quot;Prelims&quot;), are usually held at the end of the first year (after two terms for those studying Law, Theology, Philosophy and Theology, Experimental Psychology or Psychology, Philosophy and Physiology or after five terms in the case of Classics).
<p>The academic year is divided into three <a>terms</a>, determined by Regulations.
These terms are shorter than those of many other British universities.
Undergraduates are also expected to prepare heavily in the three holidays (known as the Christmas, Easter and Long Vacations).</p>
<p>In 2005/06 the University had income of &#x00a3;608m, and the colleges &#x00a3;237m (of which &#x00a3;41m is a flow-through from the University).
<p>The University also launched a fundraising campaign in May 2008, called <em>Oxford Thinking - The Campaign for the University of Oxford</em>.
<p>The decentralised, college-based nature of the admissions procedure necessitates a number of mechanisms to ensure that the best students are offered admission to the University, regardless of whether the college they originally applied to can accommodate them.
Students who named colleges which are over-subscribed are reallocated to under-subscribed colleges for their subjects.
Generally, students from all backgrounds are encouraged to apply as many factors besides academic performance are taken into account during the stringent admission procedure.</p>

However, most pupils who are accepted from state schools come from 'elite' grammar and selective schools, rather than <a>comprehensives</a>.
The project found that, if anything, admissions tutors treat applicants from state schools more favourably than applicants from private schools with the same attainment.
The Oxford Opportunity Bursaries, introduced in 2006, are university-wide means-based bursaries available to any British undergraduate.

<p>As well as the Bodleian, there are a number of other specialised libraries in Oxford, such as the <a>Sackler Library</a> which holds classical collections.

It also contains &quot;<a>The Messiah</a>&quot;, a pristine Stradivarius violin, regarded by some as one of the finest examples in existence.
The Ashmolean reopened in November 2009, after a &#x00a3;49m redevelopment, doubling the display space as well as providing new facilities.</p>
<p>The <a>Museum of Natural History</a> holds the University&#x2019;s anatomical and natural history specimens.
<p>The <a>Museum of the History of Science</a> is housed on Broad St in the world&#x2019;s oldest-surviving purpose-built museum building.
It contains 15,000 artifacts, from antiquity to the 20th century, representing almost all aspects of the <a>history of science</a>.
<p>There are many notable Oxonians (as alumni of the University are known):</p>
<li><a>University Church of St Mary the Virgin</a></li>
<p>There are other higher and <a>further education</a> institutions in Oxford, including various independent &quot;colleges&quot;, not associated with the University.
<p>The University of Oxford is an Educational Alliance Partner of the <a>Meade 4M Community</a> which supports the University's 'Project Jetwatch' program.</p>
