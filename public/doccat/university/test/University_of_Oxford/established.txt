It is the second <a>oldest surviving university</a> in the world and the oldest university in the <a>English-speaking world</a>.
In <a>post-nominals</a> the University of Oxford was historically abbreviated as <strong>Oxon.</strong>
(from the Latin <em>Oxoniensis</em>), although <strong>Oxf</strong> is nowadays used in official University publications.</p>
Oxford though was long considered a bastion of male privilege, and a quota of female students was instituted by the Universities dons in 1927 fixing the admission of women at about a quarter of the total, a ruling not abolished until 1957.
Five previously all-male colleges became co-educational in 1974.
Facilities such as libraries are provided on all these levels: by the central university (the <a>Bodleian</a>), by the departments (individual departmental libraries, such as the English Faculty Library), and by colleges (each of which maintains a multi-discipline library for the use of its members).
The University Council is the executive policy-forming body, which consists of the Vice-Chancellor as well as heads of departments and other members elected by Congregation, in addition to observers from the <a>Student Union</a>.
<a>Congregation</a>, the &quot;parliament of the dons&quot;, comprises over 3,700 members of the University&#x2019;s academic and administrative staff, and has ultimate responsibility for legislative matters: it discusses and pronounces on policies proposed by the University Council.
This role incorporates student welfare and discipline, as well as oversight of the university's proceedings.

Undergraduates must be in residence from Thursday of 0th week.</p>
The Central University's endowment, along with that of many of the colleges, is managed by the University's wholly owned endowment management office, Oxford University Endowment Management, formed in 2007.</p>
Selection is based on achieved and predicted exam results; candidate-submitted written work; school references; interviews, which are held between applicants and college tutors; and, in some subjects, written admission tests prior to interview.
<p>For graduate student admissions, many colleges express a preference for candidates who will be undertaking research in an area of interest of one of its fellows.
<p>Despite the University's claims that its admissions policies avoid bias against candidates of certain socioeconomic or educational backgrounds, the fairness of Oxford admissions have continued to attract considerable public controversy through episodes such as the <a>Laura Spence Affair</a> in 2000.
In 2007, the University refined its admissions procedure to take into account the academic performance of applicants' schools.</p>
The research also suggested that this discounting was justified as private school students need higher grades at entry to do as well as their state school educated peers in final university examinations.
Finally, the study found that applicants to arts subjects had an advantage in admission when they displayed high levels of <a>cultural capital</a>.</p>
As such, its collection is growing at a rate of over three miles (five kilometres) of shelving every year.
<p>Oxford maintains a number of museums and galleries in addition to its libraries.
The <a>Ashmolean Museum</a>, founded in 1683, is the oldest museum in the UK, and the oldest university museum in the world.

the Museum of Natural History is the <a>Pitt Rivers Museum</a>, founded in 1884, which displays the University&#x2019;s archaeological and anthropological collections, currently holding over 500,000 items.
It recently built a new research annexe; its staff have been involved with the teaching of anthropology at Oxford since its foundation, when as part of his donation General <a>Augustus Pitt Rivers</a> stipulated that the University establish a lectureship in anthropology.</p>
The <a>Botanic Garden</a> is the oldest botanic garden in the UK, and the third-oldest scientific garden in the world.
<p>In the subject tables of the <a>Times Good University Guide</a> 2008, Oxford is ranked as the top university in the UK with Cambridge as the second.
The University then takes three third-places and an equal-third, as well as a fourth, fifth, and equal-sixth place in one subject each.</p>
<p>In the 2010 <a>Academic Ranking of World Universities</a>, Oxford was ranked 10th in the world and second in Europe.
It had been consistently in the top five since the rankings began in 2004.
In 2009 it had been ranked second in the world for arts and humanities, third in life sciences and biomedicine, third in social sciences, and fifth in natural sciences.
Oxford also came second in the world in terms of graduate employability.</p>
Oxford was mentioned in fiction as early as 1400 when <a>Chaucer</a> in his <em><a>Canterbury Tales</a></em> referred to a &quot;Clerk [student] of Oxenford&quot;: &quot;For him was levere have at his beddes heed/ Twenty bookes, clad in blak or reed,/ of Aristotle and his philosophie/ Than robes riche, or fithele, or gay sautrie&quot;.
