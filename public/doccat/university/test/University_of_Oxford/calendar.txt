Teaching members of the colleges (fellows and tutors) are collectively and familiarly known as dons (though the term is rarely used by members of the university itself).
<p> Undergraduate teaching is centered on the tutorial, where 1&#x2013;4 students spend an hour with an academic discussing their week&#x2019;s work, usually an essay (humanities, most social sciences, some mathematical, physical, and life sciences) or problem sheet (most mathematical, physical, and life sciences, and some social sciences).
The second set of examinations, the Final Honour School (&quot;Finals&quot;), is held at the end of the undergraduate course.
Research degrees at the master's and doctoral level are conferred in all subjects studied at graduate level at the university.
<p>Internally at least, the dates in the term are often referred to by a number in reference to the start of each full term, thus the first week of any full term is called &quot;1st week&quot; and the last is &quot;8th week&quot;.
The numbering of the weeks continues up to the end of the term, and begins again with negative numbering from the beginning of the succeeding term, through &quot;minus first week&quot; and &quot;noughth week&quot;, which precedes &quot;1st week&quot;.

Since 2007 the colleges, faculties and departments have published a &quot;common framework&quot; outlining the principles and procedures they observe.</p>
<p>For the Department of Physics, college reallocation is done on a random basis after a shortlist of candidates is drawn up and before candidates are invited for interviews at the university.
About half of applications come from the state sector, under the auspices of Professor Anthony Heath.
