<p>The <strong>University of Pennsylvania</strong> (commonly referred to as <strong>Penn</strong> or <strong>UPenn</strong>) is a <a>private</a> <a>Ivy League</a> <a>research university</a> located in <a>Philadelphia</a>, <a>Pennsylvania</a>, <a>USA</a>.
Penn is the fourth-oldest institution of <a>higher education</a> in the <a>United States</a>, and is one of several institutions that claims to have been the <a>first university in America</a>.
Penn is a member of the <a>Ivy League</a> and is one of the <a>Colonial Colleges</a>.</p>
Penn offers a broad range of academic departments, an extensive research enterprise and a number of community outreach and public service programs.
<p>In <a>FY</a>2009, Penn's academic research programs undertook more than $730 million in research, involving some 3,800 faculty, 1,000 postdoctoral fellows and 5,400 support staff/graduate assistants.
Much of the funding is provided by the <a>National Institutes of Health</a> for biomedical research.
<p>In 1740, a group of Philadelphians joined together to erect a great preaching hall for the evangelist <a>George Whitefield</a>.
In the fall of 1749, eager to create a college to educate future generations, <a>Benjamin Franklin</a> circulated a pamphlet titled &quot;Proposals for the Education of Youth in Pennsylvania,&quot; his vision for what he called a &quot;Public Academy of Philadelphia.&quot;
Unlike the other <a>Colonial colleges</a> that existed in 1743&#x2014;<a>Harvard</a>, <a>William and Mary</a>, and <a>Yale</a>&#x2014;Franklin's new school would not focus merely on education for the clergy.
<p>Franklin assembled a board of trustees from among the leading citizens of <a>Philadelphia</a>, the first such non-sectarian board in America.
In 1779, not trusting then-provost the <a>Rev.
<p>After being located in downtown Philadelphia for more than a century, the campus was moved across the <a>Schuylkill River</a> to property purchased from the <a>Blockley Almshouse</a> in <a>West Philadelphia</a> in 1872, where it has since remained in an area now known as <a>University City</a>.</p>
1892.</a></p>
<p>Penn's motto is based on a line from <a>Horace</a>&#x2019;s III.24 (Book 3, Ode 24), <em>quid leges sine moribus vanae proficiunt?</em> (&quot;of what avail empty laws without [good] morals?&quot;)
<p><a>thumb|250px|right|Overlooking Lower Quad from Upper Quad</a> Much of Penn's architecture was designed by the <a>Cope &amp; Stewardson</a> firm, whose principal architects combined the <a>Gothic architecture</a> of the <a>University of Oxford</a> and the <a>University of Cambridge</a> with the local landscape to establish the <a>Collegiate Gothic</a> style.
Module 6 is located at 38th &amp; Walnut and includes spaces for 627 vehicles, 9,000 sq ft of storefront retail operations, a 9,500-ton chiller module and corresponding extension of the campus chilled water loop, and a 4,000-ton ice storage facility.
In 2007, Penn acquired about  between the campus and the Schuylkill River (the former site of the <a>Philadelphia Civic Center</a> and a nearby  site owned by the <a>United States Postal Service</a>).
Over the next decade, the site will become the home to educational, research, <a>biomedical</a>, and <a>mixed-use</a> facilities.
In 2010 Penn, in its first significant expansion across the <a>Schuylkill River</a>, purchased 23 acres from <a>DuPont</a> for storage and office space.</p>

<p>The University also owns the  <a>Morris Arboretum</a> in <a>Chestnut Hill</a> in northwestern <a>Philadelphia</a>, the official arboretum of the state of <a>Pennsylvania</a>.
Located near <a>Kennett Square, Pennsylvania</a>, New Bolton Center received nationwide media attention when <a>Kentucky Derby</a> winner <a>Barbaro</a> underwent surgery at its Widener Hospital for injuries suffered while running in the <a>Preakness Stakes</a>.</p>
Features of its <a>Beaux-Arts</a> building include a dramatic <a>rotunda</a> and gardens that include Egyptian <a>papyrus</a>.

Penn is also the home to interdisciplinary institutions such as the Institute for Medicine and Engineering, the Joseph H. Lauder Institute for Management and International Studies, the Institute for Research in Cognitive Science, and the Executive Master's in Technology Management Program.</p>
<p>The size of Penn's biomedical research organization, however, adds a very capital intensive component to the university's operations, and introduces revenue instability due to changing government regulations, reduced federal funding for research, and <a>Medicaid</a>/<a>Medicare</a> program changes.
<p> <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></em> ranked Penn #5 (tied with <a>Stanford</a>) for undergraduate education in its 2011 review.
Penn is ranked fifth in the Ivy League behind <a>Harvard</a>, <a>Princeton</a>, <a>Yale</a> and <a>Columbia</a>.
According to the <a>Mines ParisTech</a> International Professional Ranking, Penn ranks 7th (tied with <a>University of Oxford</a> and <a>Duke University</a>), and 3rd nationally only behind Harvard and Stanford.
The Center for Measuring University Performance ranks Penn in its top cluster of research universities in the nation, tied with <a>Columbia</a>, Harvard, <a>MIT</a>, and <a>Stanford</a>.
In 2007, <em><a>The Washington Monthly</a></em> ranked Penn 17th overall, and 4th among private institutions (behind <a>Cornell</a>, Stanford, and MIT) on its list of universities' contributions to national service (Research: total research spending; Ph.D.s granted in science and engineering; Community Service: the number of students in ROTC, Peace Corps, etc.; and social mobility: percentage of, and support for, Pell grant recipients).
In the School of Engineering, top departments are <a>bioengineering</a> (typically ranked in the top 5 by <em>U.S. News</em>), <a>mechanical engineering</a>, <a>chemical engineering</a> and <a>nanotechnology</a>.
A study updated the NRC rankings and adjusted them for faculty size and also factored out reputational surveys (saying that such surveys were lagging indicators of academic quality).
<p>Among its professional schools, the schools of <a>business</a>, <a>communication</a>, <a>dentistry</a>, <a>medicine</a>, <a>nursing</a>, and veterinary medicine rank in the top 5 nationally (see <em>U.S. News</em> and National Research Council).
In the 2009 <a>QS Global 200 Business Schools Report</a>, Penn was ranked 2nd in North America.</p>

<a>Chuck Bednarik</a> (Class of 1949) was a three-time <a>All-America</a>n <a>center</a>/<a>linebacker</a> who starred on the 1947 team and is generally regarded as Penn's all-time finest.
In addition to Bednarik, the '47 squad boasted four-time All-American <a>tackle</a> <a>George Savitsky</a> and three-time All-American <a>halfback</a> <a>Skip Minisi</a>.
All three standouts were subsequently elected to the <a>College Football Hall of Fame</a>, as was their coach, <a>George Munger</a> (a star running back at Penn in the early '30s).
Bednarik went on to play for 12 years with the <a>Philadelphia Eagles</a>, becoming the <a>NFL's</a> last 60-minute man.
<p><a>ESPN</a>'s <em><a>College GameDay</a></em> traveled to Penn to highlight the <a>Harvard</a>-Penn game on November 17, 2002, the first time the popular college football show had visited an Ivy League campus.</p>
Penn made its only (and the Ivy League's second) <a>Final Four</a> appearance in 1979, where the Quakers lost to <a>Magic Johnson</a>-led <a>Michigan State</a> in Salt Lake City.
Penn's team is also a member of the <a>Philadelphia Big 5</a>, along with <a>La Salle</a>, <a>Saint Joseph's</a>, <a>Temple</a>, and <a>Villanova</a>.
In 2007, the men's team won its third consecutive Ivy League title and then lost in the first round of the <a>NCAA Tournament</a> to <a>Texas A&amp;M</a>.</p>
<p><a>Franklin Field</a> is where the Quakers play football, <a>field hockey</a>, <a>lacrosse</a>, sprint football, and <a>track and field</a> (and formerly soccer).
It hosted the first commercially televised football game, was once the home field of the <a>Philadelphia Eagles</a>, and was the site of early <a>Army &#x2013; Navy</a> games.
Today it is also used by Penn students for recreation such as <a>intramural</a> and club sports, including <a>touch football</a> and cricket.
Franklin Field hosts the annual collegiate track and field event &quot;the <a>Penn Relays</a>.&quot;</p>
<p>Penn's home court, the <a>Palestra</a>, is an arena used for men's and women's basketball teams, <a>volleyball</a> teams, <a>wrestling</a> team, and <a>Philadelphia Big Five basketball</a>, as well as high school sporting events.
