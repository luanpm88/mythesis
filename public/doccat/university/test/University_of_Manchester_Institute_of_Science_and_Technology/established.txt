<p>The <strong>University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology</strong> (<strong>UMIST</strong>) was a <a>university</a> based in the centre of the <a>city</a> of <a>Manchester</a> in <a>England</a>.
It specialised in technical and scientific subjects and was a major centre for research.
On 1 October 2004, it merged with the <a>Victoria University of Manchester</a> (commonly called the University of Manchester) to form a new entity also called The <a>University of Manchester</a>.
<p>UMIST gained its <a>Royal Charter</a> in 1956 and became a fully autonomous <a>university</a> in 1993.
Previously its degrees were awarded by the <a>Victoria University of Manchester</a>.
The UMIST motto was <em>Scientia et Labore</em> (By Knowledge and Work).</p>

<p>The foundation of UMIST can be traced to 1824 during the <a>Industrial Revolution</a> when a group of Manchester businessmen and industrialists met in a <a>public house</a>, the <em>Bridgewater Arms</em>, to establish the <em><a>Mechanics' Institute in Manchester</a></em>, where artisans could learn basic science, particularly <a>mechanics</a> and <a>chemistry</a>.&lt;ref
name=&quot;kargonmain&quot;&gt;Kargon (1977) <em>pp</em>20-24&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of such institutions were founded in towns and cities throughout the country and while many of the fine <a>Victorian building</a>s built to house them remain, Manchester's alone survived as an independent institution serving some of its original educational aims throughout the 20th century.&lt;ref
<p>&lt;/ref&gt; was attended by prominent members of the science and engineering community, including:</p>
<li><a>John Dalton</a>, who became known as the <em>father of atomic theory</em> and became the Vice President of the Institute 1839-41&lt;ref name =&quot;UMIST_history&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cardwell p80&lt;/ref&gt;</li>
<li><a>Robert Hyde Greg</a>, a <a>cotton mill</a> owner who was soon to be elected a <a>Member of Parliament</a>&lt;ref name=&quot;Wrigley&quot; /&gt;</li>
<li><a>William Henry</a>, a pioneer in the scientific chemical industry, discovered <a>Henry's Law of solubility of gas in water</a>&lt;ref name =&quot;UMIST_history&quot; /&gt;</li>
He was elected first Secretary of the Mechanics' Institute&lt;ref name=&quot;kargonmain&quot;/&gt;</li>
<li>Sir <a>Benjamin Heywood</a>, a prosperous banker, acted as President of the Mechanics' Institute for the period 1824&#x2013;1841&lt;ref name=&quot;kargonmain&quot;/&gt;; his son, <a>Oliver</a> subsequently became President.&lt;ref
<p>A committee was elected to realise the planned institution, including Wood, Fairbairn, Heywood, Roberts and <a>John Davies</a> and the Institute opened in 1825 with Heywood as chairman.&lt;ref
<p>However, the Institute's intentions were paternal and no democratic control by its students was intended.
In 1829, radical <a>Rowland Detrosier</a> led a breakaway group to form the <strong>New Mechanics' Institution</strong> in Poole Street, a move that had a serious effect on the recruitment and finances of the original institute.
Subscriptions and memberships in 1830-31 were an all-time low and only the gradual opening of the board up to election by the members rectified the situation.
<p>By 1840, the Institute was established with 1,000 subscribers and a library of some 5,500 books.
<p>The Institute occupied a building on Cooper Street (near the present <a>St Peter's Square</a>) and later moved to a grander home in David Street (later renamed <a>Princess Street</a>).
A new building was begun in 1895 and opened by the <a>Prime Minister</a> <a>Arthur Balfour</a> in October 1902.&lt;ref
<p>This is the western end of what was until recently known as the UMIST Main Building, pictured above, a <a>grade II listed building</a> by Spalding and Cross with Renaissance motifs of <a>Burmantofts</a> <a>terracotta</a>.&lt;ref
name=&quot;hartwell&quot;&gt;Hartwell (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; By this time the institution was called the <em>Manchester Municipal School of Technology</em> or fondly known as <em>The Tech</em>.&lt;ref
name=&quot;cardwell&quot;&gt;Cardwell (1974)&lt;/ref&gt; As a project of the Manchester City Council it includes in the decoration many portrayals of the city's <a>coat of arms</a>.</p>
<p>As befits its roots in the early chemical industry of the region the Tech had pioneered <a>Chemical Engineering</a> as an academic subject in Britain, indeed the lectures by <a>George E. Davis</a> in 1888 were highly influential in defining the discipline.
Similarly in the 1920s it pioneered academic training in Management, with the formation of a Department of Industrial Administration funded by an endowment from <a>asbestos</a> magnate <a>Sir Samuel Turner</a>.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Tweedale, Philip Hansen, Magic Mineral to Killer Dust: Turner &amp; Newall and the asbestos hazard, Oxford University Press, 2000, ISBN 0-19-829690-8, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; But perhaps a more significant advance was the foundation in 1905 of a <em>Faculty of Technology</em>, answerable academically to its 'younger sister' the <a>Victoria University of Manchester</a> and awarding <a>BSc</a> and <a>MSc</a> degrees, the beginnings of UMIST as a University and the first technology faculty in the country.</p>
<p>After the recent merger with <a>Victoria University of Manchester</a> the UMIST Main Building was renamed as the &quot;Sackville St. Building&quot;.</p>
<p>In 1918, the institution changed name again to <em>Manchester Municipal College of Technology</em>.
V. Bowden</a> (later Lord Bowden) in 1953 marked the beginning of a phase of expansion.
During 1955 and 1956 the Manchester College of Science and Technology achieved independent university status under its own <a>Royal Charter</a> and became separately funded from the <a>University Grants Committee</a>.</p>
<p><a>thumbnail|The UMIST emblem as used in the late 20th century (based on the arms of the Institute, derived from the coat of arms of the lords of the manor of Manchester)</a></p>
<p>By 1966 all non-degree courses were moved to the <a>Manchester Polytechnic</a> which is now known as <a>Manchester Metropolitan University</a>, and in 1966 the name finally changed to the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology on the initiative of Acting Principal <a>Frank Morton</a>.&lt;ref name=TCE&gt;<em>The Chemical Engineer</em> 11 March 1999, page 30 &quot;Frank Morton&quot; (obituary)&lt;/ref&gt; UMIST and the <a>Victoria University of Manchester</a> retained close ties for the second half of the 20th century, with UMIST students being awarded, or having the choice of, a University of Manchester degree until full autonomy in 1993.</p>
<p>UMIST was the Faculty of Technology of the Victoria University of Manchester, an interesting situation because the University of Manchester held its own science and engineering courses.
However, although academically part of the University, UMIST was financially and administratively independent.</p>
<p>Congregation ceremonies were held at the University of Manchester on Oxford Road, but in 1991 the first congregation ceremony was held in the Great Hall at UMIST itself in the Sackville Street Building.</p>
<p>Students of UMIST were actually students of both UMIST and the Victoria University with graduation certificates stating the university issuing the degree as &quot;The Victoria University of Manchester&quot;.
Links between the two universities varied from collaboration, including exchange of students at lctures, through to fierce rivalry and even in one or two cases animosity.
<p>UMIST students were entitled to use the facilities of Manchester University, including the <a>John Rylands University Library</a> at the Oxford Road site and sports facilities and social clubs organised by the students' unions.
In fact, first year UMIST undergraduates were often placed into Manchester University halls of residence.</p>
<p>A prominent feature of the student calendar from the 1960s onwards was the <a>Bogle Stroll</a>.
<p>During the last quarter of the 20th century UMIST established a reputation as a major research-based university, performing well in the government's <a>Research Assessment Exercise</a> in 2001, and was well placed in various league tables.
<p>UMIST was instrumental in the founding of what is now the <a>Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester</a>.
Famous alumni include <a>Nobel Laureate</a> in <a>nuclear physics</a> Sir <a>John Cockcroft</a>, aeroplane pioneer Sir <a>Arthur Whitten Brown</a>, and designer of the <a>Lancaster bomber</a> <a>Roy Chadwick</a>, while famous academics include mathematicians <a>Louis Joel Mordell</a>, <a>Hanna Neumann</a>, <a>Lewis Fry Richardson</a> and <a>Robin Bullough</a>, and the physicist <a>Henry Lipson</a>.</p>
<p>In 2004 <a>Terry Leahy</a>, <a>CEO</a> of <a>Tesco</a> and alumnus was the last <a>Chancellor</a> of UMIST, and the Vice Chancellor was fittingly a chemical engineer, Prof John Garside.</p>
<p>UMIST, together with the <a>Victoria University of Manchester</a> ceased to exist on 1 October 2004, when they were combined in a new single <a>University of Manchester</a> hoping to combine the strengths and traditions of both.</p>
Some, such as the <a>Alan Turing Building</a>, house merged departments such as the <a>School of Mathematics</a>.
The estates plan, published in 2007, indicates an intention to sell a number of former UMIST teaching buildings, including the Moffat Building, the Maths and Social Sciences Tower, the Morton Building and the Fairbairn Building, as well as formerly UMIST-owned halls of residence including Hardy Farm, Chandos Hall, Wright-Robinson Hall and Weston Hall.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
No plans have been announced for the sale of any former Victoria University of Manchester buildings.
<p>In the estates strategy for 2010-2020 for the University of Manchester [<a>http://documents.manchester.ac.uk/display.aspx?DocID=8186</a>] it is stated that essentially all of the former UMIST campus, described as the &quot;area north of the Mancunian Way,&quot; is to be disposed of.
The Faraday Building will be replaced by student accommodation and it is envisaged that the Engineering Schools will eventually be relocated to new buildings on the site of the present halls of residence in the Grosvenor Place area.</p>
<p>In March 2007, the press claimed that the merger had created a debt of &#x00a3;30 million, about 5% of the University's annual turnover, and that the University was aiming to tackle this debt by implementing 400 <a>voluntary redundancies</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.
The <a>University and College Union</a> accused the University of mismanagement and called for a halt to recruitment.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Until the late 1980s, UMIST's official alumni organisation was called the Manchester Technology Association, a name which was a relic of UMIST's past incarnation as 'The Tech'.
The organisation's name was then updated to become the UMIST Association.
<p>In 2004, at the time of the university merger, the UMIST Association also merged with its equivalent organisation at the Victoria University of Manchester.
However, the growth of social networking websites has allowed the development of a number of unofficial UMIST alumni groups in cyberspace, particularly on <a>Facebook</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
<p>UMIST moved to its present location just south of <a>Manchester</a> city centre at the end of the 19th century.
The Main Building &lt;ref name=&quot;hartwell&quot; /&gt; (now called the <a>Sackville Street</a> Building) was purpose-built between 1895 and 1902 by Spalding and Cross.
However, construction was delayed by the war and other factors, so that the extension was not fully completed until 1957.</p>
Around a dozen modern buildings were constructed on the other side of the railway viaduct from the Main Building.
<li>Three small apple trees, said to have been grown from cuttings taken from the apple trees in <a>Sir Isaac Newton</a>'s garden, are planted by the archway containing a statue of <a>Archimedes</a> in his bath by <a>Thompson Dagnall</a>.
<li>The popular fruit cordial <a>Vimto</a> was formulated in a shed located in the space that UMIST eventually came to cover - around 1991-92 students and others were asked to give their opinions and perhaps vote on a memorial to this invention - the winner was a huge wooden carving of a Vimto bottle surrounded by the fruit whose juices are used in the production.</li>
An original bend in the river can be traced by observing the angles of two of the arches of the railway <a>viaduct</a> alongside UMIST&lt;ref name=&quot;campus_history&quot; /&gt;.
