Connected to the college is the <a>Oberlin Conservatory of Music</a>, the oldest continuously operating conservatory in the country.
Oberlin attained prominence because of the influence of its second president, the evangelist <a>Charles Finney</a>, after whom one of the College's chapels and performance spaces is named.
This heritage was commemorated on campus by the 1977 installation of sculptor <a>Cameron Armstrong</a>'s &quot;Underground Railroad Monument&quot; (a railroad track rising from the ground toward the sky) and monuments to the Oberlin-Wellington Rescue and the Harper's Ferry Raid.</p>
Dean of Women Rose Montague and the two senior residents in the dorm at the time were guests on a Chicago TV station morning talk show soon after Life Magazine's article came out, to talk about the &quot;experiment.&quot;
Students reacted vocally against the new dorms of the 1950s and 1960s (Dascomb, East, North and South), calling them expedient &quot;slabs&quot; of &quot;sleeping and feeding space,&quot; and this protest soon took on other controversies, including the <a>Civil Rights Movement</a> and the <a>Vietnam War</a>.
As a result, the quality of Oberlin's artistic community is high.
In 2010 the Oberlin Conservatory was awarded the National Medal of the Arts by President Barack Obama.</p>
<p>The <a>Allen Memorial Art Museum</a>, with over 12,000 holdings, was the first college art museum west of the Alleghenies and is held on par with those at Princeton, Harvard, and Yale.</p>
In the summer of 2007 the main level of the main library was converted into an Academic Commons that provides integrated learning support and is a hub of both academic and social activity.</p>
The OhioLINK Central Catalog represents the library holdings of 87 libraries in the state, including the State Library of Ohio, plus the Center for Research Libraries.
<p>Another aspect of Oberlin's academics is the Winter Term during the month of January.
Its budget is more than $2 million, making it the third-largest of its kind in North America behind the Berkeley Student Cooperative and the Inter-Cooperative Council of Ann Arbor, and by far the largest relative to the size of the institution whose students it serves.</p>
Oberlin bans all fraternities and sororities, making the co-ops the largest student-organized social system at the college.</p>
Some dorms also have orbs which display a color depending on how real time energy use compares to the average historic energy use.
In 2008, Oberlin received an &quot;A-&quot; on the annual College Sustainability Report Card.
This is the case for Noah, Kade, Harvey and Price renovated during the summer of 2008.
<p>Oberlin has both women's and men's rugby teams, the Rhinos and the Gruffs, respectively.
