Founded in 1964 by the <a>New South Wales Government</a>, it was the third university to be established in the metropolitan area of Sydney.
<p>Macquarie University also has the largest student exchange programme in Australia.
The <a>Academic Ranking of World Universities</a> listed Macquarie as 7th among Australian Universities in its 2009 rankings.
During this enquiry, the Senate of the <a>University of Sydney</a> put in a submission which highlighted &#x2018;the immediate need to establish a third university in the metropolitan area&#x2019;.
After much debate a future campus location was selected in what was then a semi-rural part of North Ryde, and it was decided that the future university be named after <a>Lachlan Macquarie</a>, an important early governor of the colony of New South Wales.</p>
<p>Macquarie University was formally established in 1964 with the passage of the Macquarie University Act 1964 by the New South Wales parliament.
The university was designed in the <a>Brutalist</a> style and developed by the renowned town planner <a>Walter Abraham</a> who also oversaw the next 20 years of planning and development for the university.
The fledgling Macquarie University Council decided that planning for the campus would be done within the university, rather than by consultants, and this led to the establishment of the architect-planners office.</p>
In 1972, the university established the <a>Macquarie Law School</a>, the third law school in Sydney.
In their book <em>Liberality of Opportunity</em>, Bruce Mansfield and Mark Hutchinson describe the founding of Macquarie University as &#x2018;an act of faith and a great experiment&#x2019;.
An additional topic considered in this book is the <a>science reform movement</a> of the late 1970s that resulted in the introduction of a named science degree, thus facilitating the subsequent inclusion of other named degrees in addition to the traditional BA.
<a>thumb|left|Remnants of old farming buildings</a> There have been only four Vice-Chancellors in the university&#x2019;s forty-four year history.
<a>Di Yerbury</a> was appointed to the position in 1986, and was the first female Vice-Chancellor in Australia.
Yerbury's departure was attended with much controversy, including a &quot;bitter dispute&quot; with Schwartz, disputed ownership of university artworks worth $13 million and Yerbury's salary package.
In August 2006, Professor Schwartz expressed concern about the actions of Yerbury in a letter to university auditors.
<p>During 2007, Macquarie University faced a restructuring of its student organisation after an audit raised questions about management of hundreds of thousands of dollars in funds by student organisations At the centre of the investigation was Victor Ma, president of the Macquarie University Students' Council, who had previously been involved in a high-profile case of student election fixing at the <a>University of Sydney</a>.
<p>Following the dissolution of Macquarie University Union Ltd, the outgoing student organisation was replaced with a new wholly owned subsidiary company of the university, known as U@MQ Ltd.
The new student organisation originally lacked a true student representative union; however, following a complete review and authorisation from the university Council, a new student union known as Macquarie University Students Association (MUSRA) was established in 2009.</p>
<p>Within the first few hundred days of Schwartz's instatement as Vice-Chancellor, the 'Macquarie@50' strategic plan was launched, which positioned the university to enhance research, teaching, infrastructure and academic rankings by the university's 50th anniversary in 2014.
Included in the university's plans for the future was the establishment of a sustainability office in order to more effectively manage environmental and social development at Macquarie.
As part of this campaign, in 2009 Macquarie became the first <a>Fair Trade</a> accredited university in Australia.
The beginning of 2009 also saw the introduction of a new logo for the university which retained the Sirius Star, present on both the old logo and the university crest, but now 'embedded in a stylised lotus flower'.
<a>thumb|300px|Macquarie University Lake</a> The university introduced a new curriculum in January 2010 that was intended to broaden the knowledge of graduates and to include study in general education subjects.
This process is seen as a step towards the current trend whereby universities in Australia are reducing the amount of named degrees in order to simplify enrollment and to maintain the competitiveness of Australian degrees globally in accordance with the <a>Bologna Accord</a>.
This national trend was initiated in Australia by the <a>Melbourne Model</a>.</p>
<p>The <a>University Council</a> is the governing authority of the university under the <em>Macquarie University Act 1989</em>.
Located within the high-technology corridor of Sydney's north-west and in close proximity to <a>Macquarie Park</a> and its surrounding industries, Macquarie's location has been crucial in its development as a relatively research intensive university.
The university&#x2019;s first architect-planner was <a>Walter Abraham</a>, one of the first six administrators appointed to Macquarie University.
<p>The university is currently undertaking a large infrastructure and capital works program that will see an investment of over $1 billion into new buildings and projects across the campus and has set up an Office of Major Projects to oversee the new developments.
In mid 2007, the university opened the Macquarie City Campus in the <a>Sydney CBD</a>, offering Macquarie University&#x2019;s foundation studies, selected undergraduate and postgraduate degrees.
<li><strong>Macquarie Manly Campus</strong>: In association with Macquarie University, the <a>International College of Management, Sydney</a>, offers a two-year Diploma programme (only in Hospitality, Event and International tourism), an Associate Degree Programme and a three-year Bachelor of Business Administration Degrees specialised in Hospitality, Event, International tourism, Retail, Property, and Sports Management as well as graduate certificates and master programmes.

<p>According to the <em>Good Universities Guide</em> to Australian universities, starting salaries for Macquarie graduates have been ranked as the highest in Australia for ten consecutive years (1998&#x2013;2007) and in 2009, the university received 5 star ratings in six different performance categories including non-government earnings, staff qualifications and toughness of admissions.
Macquarie University teachers also have received numerous awards and citations from the Carrick Institute for Learning and Teaching in Higher Education since it was established in 2004.
<p><em>The Economist</em> 2009 Full Time MBA rankings ranked the university's <a>Graduate School of Management</a> at 55th in the world, 4th in the Asia-Pacific region and 2nd in Australia following Melbourne University's <a>Melbourne Business School</a>.</p>
