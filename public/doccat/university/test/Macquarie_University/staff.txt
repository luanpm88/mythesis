<p><a>thumb|left|First Students at Macquarie University</a>The idea of founding a third university in Sydney was flagged in the early 1960s when the <a>New South Wales Government</a> formed a committee of enquiry into higher education to deal with a perceived emergency in university enrolments in <a>New South Wales</a>.

However, Ma strongly denied any wrongdoing and labelled the controversy a case of &#x2018;character assassination&#x2019;.
This also involves a dramatic reduction in the number of degrees available and placing them into a system of majors and minors within other existing degrees.
