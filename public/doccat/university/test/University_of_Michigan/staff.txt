<p>  The <strong>University of Michigan, Ann Arbor</strong> (commonly referred to as <strong>Michigan</strong>, <strong>U-M</strong>, <strong>UMich</strong>, or <strong>U of M</strong>) is a <a>public</a> research <a>university</a> located in the <a>state</a> of <a>Michigan</a> in the <a>United States</a>.
In 1995, the <a>National Research Council</a> ranked Michigan <a>third nationally</a> for the quality of its graduate programs.
<a>James Burrill Angell</a>, who served as the university's president from 1871 to 1909, aggressively expanded U-M's curriculum to include professional studies in <a>dentistry</a>, <a>architecture</a>, <a>engineering</a>, <a>government</a>, and <a>medicine</a>.
<p>From 1900 to 1920 the university constructed many new facilities, including buildings for the dental and pharmacy programs, chemistry, natural sciences, <a>Hill Auditorium</a>, large hospital and library complexes, and two residence halls.
The university became a favored choice for bright Jewish students from New York in the 1920s and 1930s when the <a>Ivy League</a> schools had quotas restricting the number of Jews to be admitted.
During <a>World War II</a>, U-M's research grew to include <a>U.S. Navy</a> projects such as <a>proximity fuze</a>s, <a>PT boat</a>s, and <a>radar jamming</a>.

As the <a>Cold War</a> and the <a>Space Race</a> took hold, U-M became a major recipient of government grants for strategic research and helped to develop peacetime uses for <a>nuclear energy</a>.
<p><a>thumb|left|The Central Campus Diag, viewed from the Graduate Library, looking North|alt=Red brick plaza, surrounded by trees with green leaves, with two white tents and an American flag flying from a flagpole in the center</a> <a>Lyndon B. Johnson</a>'s speech outlining his <a>Great Society</a> program also occurred at U-M.
In response to a series of <a>sit-in</a>s in 1966 by <em>Voice</em>&#x2013;the campus political party of <a>Students for a Democratic Society</a>, U-M's administration banned sit-ins.
<p>Former U-M student and noted architect <a>Alden B. Dow</a> designed the current Fleming Administration Building, which was completed in 1968.
The university's involvement in the anti-missile <a>Strategic Defense Initiative</a> and investments in <a>South Africa</a> caused controversy on campus.
<p><a>thumb|right|Law Library Interior|alt=Law Library</a> In 2003, two lawsuits involving U-M's <a>affirmative action</a> admissions policy reached the <a>U.S. Supreme Court</a> (<em><a>Grutter v. Bollinger</a></em> and <em><a>Gratz v. Bollinger</a></em>).
President <a>George W. Bush</a> took the unusual step of publicly opposing the policy before the court issued a ruling.

The architect <a>Eero Saarinen</a>, based in <a>Birmingham, Michigan</a>, created one of the early master plans for North Campus and designed several of its buildings in the 1950s, including the Earl V. Moore School of Music Building.
Each of the bell towers houses a grand <a>carillon</a>.
<p>North Campus houses the <a>College of Engineering</a>, the <a>School of Music, Theatre &amp; Dance</a>, the <a>School of Art &amp; Design</a>, the <a>Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning</a>, and an annex of the School of Information.
The Duderstadt Center also contains multiple <a>computer lab</a>s, <a>video editing</a> studios, and a <a>3D</a> <a>virtual reality</a> room.
Other libraries located on North Campus include the <a>Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library</a> and the <a>Bentley Historical Library</a>.</p>
<p>South Campus is the site for the athletic programs, including major sports facilities such as <a>Michigan Stadium</a>, <a>Crisler Arena</a>, and <a>Yost Ice Arena</a>.
It was designed in the late 1920s by <a>Alister MacKenzie</a>, the designer of <a>Augusta National Golf Club</a> in <a>Augusta, Georgia</a> (home of The <a>Masters Tournament</a>).
The U-M Golf Course&#x2019;s signature No. 6 hole&#x2014;a  par 4, which plays from an elevated tee to a two-tiered, kidney-shaped green protected by four bunkers&#x2014;is the second hole on the Alister MacKenzie Dream 18 as selected by a five-person panel that includes three-time Masters champion <a>Nick Faldo</a> and golf course architect <a>Tom Doak</a>.
<p>  The University of Michigan consists of a flagship campus in Ann Arbor, with two regional campuses in <a>Dearborn</a> and <a>Flint</a>.
Her total compensation for 2008&#x2013;2009 totaled $783,850.</p>
<a>Professional degrees</a> are conferred by the Schools of Public Health, <a>Dentistry</a>, Law, <a>Medicine</a>, and Pharmacy.
MSA has also been successful at reviving <a>Homecoming</a> activities, including a carnival and parade, for students after a roughly eleven-year absence in October 2007.</p>
Such a designation would achieve parity with other Big Ten schools that have student regents.
Waun ran for a second time in 2002, along with Matt Petering and Susan Fawcett.
<p>National honor societies such as <a>Phi Beta Kappa</a>, <a>Phi Kappa Phi</a>, and <a>Tau Beta Pi</a> have chapters at U-M. Degrees &quot;with Highest Distinction&quot; are recommended to students who rank in the top 3% of their class, &quot;with High Distinction&quot; to the next 7%, and &quot;with Distinction&quot; to the next 15%.
Students earning a minimum overall GPA of 3.4 who have demonstrated high academic achievement and capacity for independent work may be recommended for a degree &quot;with Highest Honors,&quot; &quot;with High Honors,&quot; or &quot;with Honors.&quot;
8% were eligible for <a>Pell Grant</a>s.
Students come from all 50 <a>U.S. state</a>s and more than 100 countries.
<p><a>thumb|Biomedical Science Research Building at the U-M Medical School|alt=Building with curving bluish-green glass facade behind a road intersection</a> The university is also a major contributor to the medical field with the <a>EKG</a>, <a>gastroscope</a>, and the announcement of <a>Jonas Salk</a>'s polio vaccine.
The university's  <a>biological station</a> in the <a>Northern Lower Peninsula of Michigan</a> is one of only 47 <a>Biosphere Reserves</a> in the United States.</p>
<p>In the mid-1960s U-M researchers worked with <a>IBM</a> to develop a new <a>virtual memory</a> architectural model that became part of <a>IBM's Model 360/67</a> <a>mainframe computer</a> (the 360/67 was initially dubbed the 360/65M where the &quot;M&quot; stood for Michigan).
The <a>Michigan Terminal System</a> (<a>MTS</a>), an early <a>time-sharing</a> computer <a>operating system</a> developed at U-M, was the first system outside of IBM to use the 360/67's virtual memory features.
Another major contribution took place in 1987 when a proposal submitted by the Merit Network together with its partners <a>IBM</a>, <a>MCI</a>, and the <a>State of Michigan</a> won a national competition to upgrade and expand the <a>National Science Foundation Network</a> (<a>NSFNET</a>) backbone from 56,000 to 1.5 million, and later to 45 million bits per second.
<a>NSFNET</a> was the precursor to today's <a>Internet</a>.
The Institute for Social Research (ISR), the nation's longest-standing laboratory for interdisciplinary research in the social sciences, is home to the Survey Research Center, Research Center for Group Dynamics, Center for Political Studies, Population Studies Center, and Inter-Consortium for Political and Social Research.
U-M was the original home of the <a>JSTOR</a> database, which contains about 750,000 digitized pages from the entire pre-1990 backfile of ten journals of history and economics, and  has initiated a book digitization program in collaboration with <a>Google</a>.
These communities focus on areas such as research through the Michigan Research Community, medical sciences, <a>community service</a> and the <a>German language</a>.
This residence complex is composed of two additional living-learning communities: the <a>Global Scholars Program</a> and the <a>Max Kade German Program</a>.
With a history of student activism, some of the most visible groups include those dedicated to causes such as <a>civil rights</a> and <a>labor rights</a>.
One group is <a>Students for a Democratic Society</a>, which recently reformed with a new chapter on campus as of February 2007, the <a>Weather Underground</a>.
There are also several engineering projects teams, including the <a>University of Michigan Solar Car Team</a>, which placed first in the <a>North American Solar Challenge</a> five times and third in the <a>World Solar Challenge</a> three times.
<p>The university also showcases many community service organizations and charitable projects, including <a>Foundation for International Medical Relief of Children</a>, Dance Marathon at the University of Michigan, <a>The Detroit Partnership</a>, <a>Relay For Life</a>, U-M Stars for the Make-A-Wish Foundation, InnoWorks at the University of Michigan, SERVE, Letters to Success, PROVIDES, Circle K, <a>Habitat for Humanity</a>, and Ann Arbor Reaching Out.
<p><a>Fraternities and sororities</a> play a role in the university's social life.
Each of these councils has a different recruitment process.</p>
It performs regularly in the <a>Michigan Theater</a>.
Its eight member subset <a>a cappella</a> group, the <a>University of Michigan Friars</a>, which was founded in 1955, is the oldest currently running <em>a cappella</em> group on campus.</p>
They participate in the <a>NCAA's</a> Football Bowl Subdivision (formally <a>Division I-A</a>) and in the <a>Big Ten Conference</a> in all sports except men's <a>ice hockey</a>, which is a member of the <a>Central Collegiate Hockey Association</a>, and woman's water polo, which is a member of the Collegiate Water Polo Association.
<p>The <a>Michigan football</a> program ranks first in NCAA history in both total wins (884) and winning percentage (.740).
The program has eleven <a>national championships</a>, most recently in 1997, and has produced three <a>Heisman Trophy</a> winners: <a>Tom Harmon</a>, <a>Desmond Howard</a> and <a>Charles Woodson</a>.</p>
U-M has fierce rivalries with many teams, including <a>Michigan State</a>, <a>Notre Dame</a>, and <a>Ohio State</a>, the last of which has been referred to by <a>ESPN</a> as the <a>greatest rivalry</a> in American sports.
<p>The men's <a>ice hockey</a> team, which plays at <a>Yost Ice Arena</a>, has won nine <a>national championships</a>, while the <a>men's basketball</a> team, which plays at <a>Crisler Arena</a>, has appeared in four <a>Final Fours</a> and won a <a>national championship</a> in 1989.
However, the program became involved in a <a>scandal involving payments from a booster</a> during the 1990s.
This led to the program being placed on probation for a four-year period.
U-M students have won a total of <a>133 Olympic medals</a>: 65 gold, 30 silver, and 38 bronze.
President <a>Gerald Ford</a> had it played by the <a>United States Marine Band</a> as his entrance anthem in preference over the more traditional <em>Hail to the Chief</em> during his term from 1974 to 1977, and the <a>Michigan Marching Band</a> performed a slow-tempo variation on the fight song at his funeral.
A common rally cry is &quot;Let's Go Blue!&quot;, written by former students Joseph Carl, a sousaphonist, and Albert Ahronheim, a <a>drum major</a>.</p>
<p> In addition to the late <a>U.S. president</a> <a>Gerald Ford</a>, the university has produced twenty-six <a>Rhodes Scholars</a>, numerous Marshall Scholars, seven <a>Nobel Prize</a> winners, 116 <a>Olympic medalist</a>s, U-M's contributions to aeronautics include aircraft designer <a>Clarence &quot;Kelly&quot; Johnson</a> of <a>Lockheed</a> <a>Skunk Works</a> fame, Lockheed president <a>Willis Hawkins</a>, and several astronauts including the all-U-M crew of <a>Gemini 4</a> and the all-Michigan crew of <a>Apollo 15</a>.
U-M counts among its matriculants <a>seventeen billionaires</a> and prominent company founders and co-founders including <a>Google</a> co-founder <a>Larry Page</a> and <a>Dr.
J. Robert Beyster</a> who founded <a>Science Applications International Corporation</a> (SAIC) in 1969.</li>
<p>Notable writers who attended U-M include playwright <a>Arthur Miller</a>, essayists <a>Susan Orlean</a> and <a>Sven Birkerts</a>, journalists and editors <a>Mike Wallace</a>, current Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors of the <a>Federal Reserve System</a> <a>Donald Kohn</a>,  <a>Temel Kotil</a> who is the president and CEO of <a>Turkish Airlines</a>, current Dean of <a>Harvard Law School</a> <a>Martha Minow</a>, former House Minority Leader <a>Dick Gephardt</a>, activist <a>Tom Hayden</a>,  <a>Ryan Drummond</a> who was the voice of <a>Sonic the Hedgehog</a> in the series of video games from 1999&#x2013;2004, the Swedish Holocaust hero <a>Raoul Wallenberg</a>, and <a>Benjamin D. Pritchard</a>, the Civil War general who captured <a>Jefferson Davis</a>.
<a>Vaughn R. Walker</a>, who is a Federal District Judge in California and overturned the controversial <a>California Proposition 8</a> in 2010 and ruled it unconstitutional, received his undergraduate degree from U-M in 1966.
Pop Superstar <a>Madonna</a> and rock legend <a>Iggy Pop</a> attended but did not graduate.</p>
<p>Some more notorious graduates of the University are 1910 convicted murderer (though perhaps wrongfully so) Dr. <a>Harvey Crippen</a>, late 19th-century American serial killer <a>Herman Mudgett</a>, and &quot;Unabomber&quot; <a>Ted Kaczynski</a>.</p>
<p>U-M athletes have starred in Major League Baseball, the <a>National Football League</a> and <a>National Basketball Association</a> as well as other professional sports.
Notable among recent players is <a>Tom Brady</a> of the <a>New England Patriots</a>.
<a>NHL</a> players <a>Marty Turco</a>, <a>Chris Summers</a>, <a>Brendan Morrison</a>, and <a>Michael Cammalleri</a> all played for U-M's ice hockey team.
<p>The university claims the only alumni association with a chapter on the <a>moon</a>, established in 1971 when the crew of <a>Apollo 15</a> placed a charter plaque for a new U-M Alumni Association on the lunar surface.</p>
