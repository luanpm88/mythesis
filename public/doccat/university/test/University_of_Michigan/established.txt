What would become the university moved to <a>Ann Arbor</a> in 1837 onto 40 acres (16 ha) of what is now known as Central Campus.
Since its establishment in Ann Arbor, the university has physically expanded to include more than 584 major buildings with a combined area of more than 31 million gross square feet (712&nbsp;acres or 2.38&nbsp;km&#x00b2;), During the 20th century and early 2000s, U-M was the site of much <a>student activism</a>.
<p>In the 2011 <em>U.S. News &amp; World Report</em> &quot;National University Rankings&quot;, the university was ranked 29th among national universities in the United States.
U-M owns the <a>University of Michigan Health System</a> and has one of the largest research expenditures of any American university, passing the $1.14 billion dollar mark during the 2009-2010 academic year.
U-M also became the first American university to use the <a>seminar</a> method of study.</p>
In 1920 the university reorganized the <a>College of Engineering</a> and formed an advisory committee of 100 industrialists to guide academic research initiatives.
The building's plans were drawn in the early 1960s, before student activism prompted a concern for safety, but the Fleming Building's narrow windows, all located above the first floor, and fortress-like exterior led to a campus rumor that it was designed to be riot-proof.
<p>During the 1970s, severe budget constraints challenged the university's physical development; but, in the 1980s, the university received increased grants for research in the social and physical sciences.
At the same time, the university attempted to maintain its high academic standing while keeping <a>tuition</a> costs affordable.
The university is currently engaged in a $2.5 billion construction campaign.
The court found that race may be considered as a factor in university admissions in all public universities and private universities that accept federal funding.
<p>The debate continues because in November 2006, Michigan voters passed <a>Proposal 2</a>, banning most affirmative action in university admissions.
U-M and other organizations were granted a stay from implementation of the passed proposal soon after that election, and this has allowed time for proponents of affirmative action to decide legal and constitutional options in response to the election results.
The university has stated it plans to continue to challenge the ruling; in the meantime, the admissions office states that it will attempt to achieve a diverse student body by looking at other factors, such as whether the student attended a disadvantaged school, and the level of education of the student's parents.
There is also leased space in buildings scattered throughout the city, many occupied by organizations affiliated with the University of Michigan Health System.
The university also operates a large office building called Wolverine Tower in southern Ann Arbor near Briarwood Mall.
A tall white-colored stone clock tower with a green roof is in the background</a> Central Campus was the original location of U-M when it moved to Ann Arbor in 1837.
It originally had a school and dormitory building (where Mason Hall now stands) and several houses for professors on land bounded by North University Avenue, South University Avenue, East University Avenue, and State Street.</p>
The Board of Regents, which governs the university and was established by the Organic Act of March 18, 1837, consists of eight members elected at large in biennial state elections for overlapping eight year terms.
Between the establishment of the University of Michigan in 1837 and 1850, the Board of Regents ran the university directly; although they were, by law, supposed to appoint a Chancellor to administer the university, they never did.
The office was created by the <a>Michigan Constitution</a> of 1850, which also specified that the president was to be appointed by the Regents of the University of Michigan and preside at their meetings, but without a vote.
It was the <a>seventh largest</a> endowment in the U.S. and the third-largest among U.S public universities at that time, as well as the <a>fastest growing</a> endowment in the nation over the last 21 years.
Slated to run through December 2008, the university announced that the campaign had reached its target 19 months early in May 2007.
Like nearly all colleges and universities, U-M suffered significant realized and unrealized losses in its endowment during the second half of 2008.
In February 2009, a university spokesperson estimated losses of between 20 and 30 percent.
In recent years MSA has organized airBus, a transportation service between campus and the <a>Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport</a>, and has led the university's efforts to register its student population to vote, with its Voice Your Vote Commission (VYV) registering 10,000 students in 2004.
<p>There are student governance bodies in each college and school.
Although none of these campaigns has been successful, a poll conducted by the State of Michigan in 1998 concluded that a majority of Michigan voters would approve of such a position if the measure were put before them.</p>
The four year, full-time undergraduate program comprises the majority of enrollments and emphasizes instruction in the arts, sciences, and professions and there is a high level of coexistence between graduate and undergraduate programs.
The university has &quot;very high&quot; research activity and the &quot;comprehensive&quot; graduate program offers doctoral degrees in the humanities, social sciences, and <a>STEM fields</a> as well as professional degrees in medicine, law, and dentistry.
U-M provides financial aid in the form of need-based loans, grants, scholarships, work study, and non-need based scholarships, with 77% of undergraduates in 2007 receiving financial aid.
For undergraduates in 2008, 46% graduated with about $25,586 of debt in 2008.</p>
97% of the university's incoming class of 2009 earned a high school GPA of 3.0 and higher, while the middle 50% of the incoming class earned a high school GPA of 3.60 to 3.90.
In the late 1960s U-M, together with <a>Michigan State University</a> and <a>Wayne State University</a>, founded the <a>Merit Network</a>, one of the first university computer networks.
Those hubs include the National LambdaRail, StarLight, and an emerging set of network connections that play key roles in the national cyberinfrastructure supporting advanced science and research.</p>
The Residential College (RC), a living-learning community that is a division of the College of Literature, Science and the Arts, also has its principal instructional space in East Quad.
Membership numbers for the 2009-2010 school year reached the highest in the last two decades.
The <a>University of Michigan Men's Glee Club</a>, founded in 1859, is a men's chorus with over 100 members.
Founded in 1890, <em>The Daily</em> is published five days a week during the normal academic year, and weekly during the spring and summer terms.
In 10 of the past 14 years concluding in 2009, U-M has finished in the top five of the <a>NACDA Director's Cup</a>, a ranking compiled by the <a>National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics</a> to tabulate the success of universities in competitive sports.
U-M has finished in the top ten of the Directors' Cup standings in 14 of the award's sixteen seasons and has placed in the top six in 9 of the last 10 seasons.</p>
U-M has all-time winning records against Michigan State University, University of Notre Dame, and Ohio State University.</p>
The program also voluntarily vacated victories from its 1992&#x2013;1993 and 1995&#x2013;1999 seasons in which the payments took place, as well as its 1992 and 1993 Final Four appearances.</p>
&lt;!--Needs citation: U-M is the only school in the U.S. to have won Division I National Championships in football, baseball, basketball, and hockey.--&gt;</p>
Michigan was considered to be on the Western Frontier when it was founded in the old Northwest Territory.
