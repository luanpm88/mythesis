nickname$$$@@@%%%When presidential candidate <a>John F. Kennedy</a> visited the University on October 14, 1960, he gave an impromptu speech on the steps of the <a>Michigan Union</a> that led to a University of Michigan student movement which contributed to the establishment of the <a>Peace Corps</a>.
nickname$$$@@@%%%The University was also a focal point in the controversy over <a>affirmative action</a> within higher education admissions.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In the 2011 <em>U.S. News &amp; World Report</em> &quot;National University Rankings&quot;, the university was ranked 29th among national universities in the United States.
staff$$$@@@%%%In 1995, the <a>National Research Council</a> ranked Michigan <a>third nationally</a> for the quality of its graduate programs.
location$$$@@@%%%Michigan has one of the world's largest living alumni groups at 460,000 in 2007.
established$$$@@@%%%U-M owns the <a>University of Michigan Health System</a> and has one of the largest research expenditures of any American university, passing the $1.14 billion dollar mark during the 2009-2010 academic year.
staff$$$@@@%%%<a>James Burrill Angell</a>, who served as the university's president from 1871 to 1909, aggressively expanded U-M's curriculum to include professional studies in <a>dentistry</a>, <a>architecture</a>, <a>engineering</a>, <a>government</a>, and <a>medicine</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%U-M also became the first American university to use the <a>seminar</a> method of study.</p>
staff$$$@@@%%%<p>From 1900 to 1920 the university constructed many new facilities, including buildings for the dental and pharmacy programs, chemistry, natural sciences, <a>Hill Auditorium</a>, large hospital and library complexes, and two residence halls.
established$$$@@@%%%In 1920 the university reorganized the <a>College of Engineering</a> and formed an advisory committee of 100 industrialists to guide academic research initiatives.
staff$$$@@@%%%The university became a favored choice for bright Jewish students from New York in the 1920s and 1930s when the <a>Ivy League</a> schools had quotas restricting the number of Jews to be admitted.
nickname$$$@@@%%%As a result, U-M gained the nickname &quot;Harvard of the West,&quot; which became commonly parodied in reverse after <a>John F.

staff$$$@@@%%%In response to a series of <a>sit-in</a>s in 1966 by <em>Voice</em>&#x2013;the campus political party of <a>Students for a Democratic Society</a>, U-M's administration banned sit-ins.
postgrad$$$@@@%%%In response, 1,500 students had a one-hour sit-in the LSA Building, which housed administrative offices.

staff$$$@@@%%%<p>Former U-M student and noted architect <a>Alden B. Dow</a> designed the current Fleming Administration Building, which was completed in 1968.
established$$$@@@%%%The building's plans were drawn in the early 1960s, before student activism prompted a concern for safety, but the Fleming Building's narrow windows, all located above the first floor, and fortress-like exterior led to a campus rumor that it was designed to be riot-proof.
mottoeng$$$@@@%%%Dow denied those rumors, claiming the small windows were designed to be energy efficient.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>During the 1970s, severe budget constraints challenged the university's physical development; but, in the 1980s, the university received increased grants for research in the social and physical sciences.
staff$$$@@@%%%The university's involvement in the anti-missile <a>Strategic Defense Initiative</a> and investments in <a>South Africa</a> caused controversy on campus.
calendar$$$@@@%%%During the 1980s and 1990s, the university devoted substantial resources to renovating its massive hospital complex and improving the academic facilities on the North Campus.
nickname$$$@@@%%%The university also emphasized the development of computer and information technology throughout the campus.</p>
mottoeng$$$@@@%%%<p>In the early 2000s, U-M also faced declining state funding due to state budget shortfalls.
established$$$@@@%%%At the same time, the university attempted to maintain its high academic standing while keeping <a>tuition</a> costs affordable.
calendar$$$@@@%%%There were disputes between U-M's administration and labor unions, notably with the Lecturers' Employees Organization (LEO) and the Graduate Employees Organization (GEO), the union representing graduate student employees.
website$$$@@@%%%These conflicts led to a series of one-day walkouts by the unions and their supporters.

staff$$$@@@%%%<p><a>thumb|right|Law Library Interior|alt=Law Library</a> In 2003, two lawsuits involving U-M's <a>affirmative action</a> admissions policy reached the <a>U.S. Supreme Court</a> (<em><a>Grutter v. Bollinger</a></em> and <em><a>Gratz v. Bollinger</a></em>).
staff$$$@@@%%%President <a>George W. Bush</a> took the unusual step of publicly opposing the policy before the court issued a ruling.
established$$$@@@%%%The court found that race may be considered as a factor in university admissions in all public universities and private universities that accept federal funding.
website$$$@@@%%%But, it ruled that a point system was unconstitutional.
calendar$$$@@@%%%In the first case, the court upheld the <a>Law School</a> admissions policy, while in the second it ruled against the university's undergraduate admissions policy.
image_size$$$@@@%%%</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>The debate continues because in November 2006, Michigan voters passed <a>Proposal 2</a>, banning most affirmative action in university admissions.
location$$$@@@%%%Under that law race, gender, and national origin can no longer be considered in admissions.
established$$$@@@%%%U-M and other organizations were granted a stay from implementation of the passed proposal soon after that election, and this has allowed time for proponents of affirmative action to decide legal and constitutional options in response to the election results.
established$$$@@@%%%The university has stated it plans to continue to challenge the ruling; in the meantime, the admissions office states that it will attempt to achieve a diverse student body by looking at other factors, such as whether the student attended a disadvantaged school, and the level of education of the student's parents.
nickname$$$@@@%%%The Central and South Campus areas are contiguous, while the North Campus area is separated from them, primarily by the <a>Huron River</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%There is also leased space in buildings scattered throughout the city, many occupied by organizations affiliated with the University of Michigan Health System.
president$$$@@@%%%An East Medical Campus has recently been developed on Plymouth Road, with several university-owned buildings for outpatient care, diagnostics, and outpatient surgery.</p>
type$$$@@@%%%<p>In addition to the U-M Golf Course on South Campus, the university operates a second golf course called &quot;Radrick Farms Golf Course&quot; on Geddes Road.

staff$$$@@@%%%<p>  The University of Michigan consists of a flagship campus in Ann Arbor, with two regional campuses in <a>Dearborn</a> and <a>Flint</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%The Board of Regents, which governs the university and was established by the Organic Act of March 18, 1837, consists of eight members elected at large in biennial state elections for overlapping eight year terms.
established$$$@@@%%%Between the establishment of the University of Michigan in 1837 and 1850, the Board of Regents ran the university directly; although they were, by law, supposed to appoint a Chancellor to administer the university, they never did.
mottoeng$$$@@@%%%Instead a rotating roster of professors carried out the day-to-day administration duties.</p>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>The President of the University of Michigan is the principal executive officer of the university.
established$$$@@@%%%The office was created by the <a>Michigan Constitution</a> of 1850, which also specified that the president was to be appointed by the Regents of the University of Michigan and preside at their meetings, but without a vote.
calendar$$$@@@%%%Today, the president's office is at the Ann Arbor campus, and the president has the privilege of living in the President's House, one of the university's oldest buildings located on Central Campus in Ann Arbor.
calendar$$$@@@%%%<a>Mary Sue Coleman</a> is the 13th president of the university and has served since August 2002.
staff$$$@@@%%%Her total compensation for 2008&#x2013;2009 totaled $783,850.</p>
nickname$$$@@@%%%<p>There are thirteen undergraduate schools and colleges.
nickname$$$@@@%%%By enrollment, the three largest undergraduate units are the <a>College of Literature, Science, and the Arts</a>, the <a>College of Engineering</a>, and the <a>Ross School of Business</a>.
calendar$$$@@@%%%At the graduate level, the Rackham Graduate School serves as the central administrative unit of graduate education at the university.
calendar$$$@@@%%%There are eighteen graduate schools and colleges, the largest of which are the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, the College of Engineering, the Law School, and the Ross School of Business.
staff$$$@@@%%%<a>Professional degrees</a> are conferred by the Schools of Public Health, <a>Dentistry</a>, Law, <a>Medicine</a>, and Pharmacy.
established$$$@@@%%%It was the <a>seventh largest</a> endowment in the U.S. and the third-largest among U.S public universities at that time, as well as the <a>fastest growing</a> endowment in the nation over the last 21 years.
mottoeng$$$@@@%%%The endowment is primarily used according to the donors' wishes, which include the support of teaching and research.
free_label$$$@@@%%%In mid-2000, U-M embarked on a massive fund-raising campaign called &quot;The Michigan Difference,&quot; which aimed to raise $2.5 billion, with $800 million designated for the permanent endowment.
established$$$@@@%%%Slated to run through December 2008, the university announced that the campaign had reached its target 19 months early in May 2007.
calendar$$$@@@%%%Ultimately, the campaign raised $3.2 billion over 8 years.
mottoeng$$$@@@%%%Over the course of the capital campaign, 191 additional professorships were endowed, bringing the university total to 471 as of 2009.
established$$$@@@%%%Like nearly all colleges and universities, U-M suffered significant realized and unrealized losses in its endowment during the second half of 2008.

calendar$$$@@@%%%<p>A longstanding goal of the student government is to create a student-designated seat on the Board of Regents, the university's governing body.
staff$$$@@@%%%Such a designation would achieve parity with other Big Ten schools that have student regents.
calendar$$$@@@%%%In 2000, students Nick Waun and Scott Trudeau ran for the board on the state-wide ballot as third-party nominees.
staff$$$@@@%%%Waun ran for a second time in 2002, along with Matt Petering and Susan Fawcett.
