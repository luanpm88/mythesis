<p><a>thumb|left|Star III, in front of Scripps Institution of Oceanography</a> When the <a>Regents of the University of California</a> originally authorized the San Diego campus in 1956, it was planned as first imagined by <a>Roger Revelle</a>, Director of Scripps, to start as a graduate school of science and engineering comparable in quality to <a>Caltech</a>.&lt;ref
name=Kerr&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Citizens of San Diego supported the idea, voting the same year to transfer to the university of mesa land on the coast near the Scripps Institute.
The Regents requested an additional gift of of undeveloped mesa land northeast of Scripps, as well as on the former site of <a>Camp Matthews</a>, but Revelle jeopardized the site selection by making public La Jolla's exclusive real estate practices antagonistic to minority racial and religious groups, angering local conservatives as well as UC Regent <a>Edwin W. Pauley</a>.&lt;ref
name=Kerr/&gt; UC President <a>Clark Kerr</a> satisfied San Diego city donors by changing the proposed name from University of California, La Jolla, to University of California, San Diego.&lt;ref

Because of the clash with Pauley, Revelle was not made chancellor&#x2014;<a>Herbert York</a>, first director of <a>Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a>, was designated instead.&lt;ref
name=Kerr/&gt; York worked out the planning of the main campus according to the &quot;<a>Oxbridge</a>&quot; model, relying on many of Revelle's ideas.&lt;ref
<p>UCSD was the first general campus of the UC to be designed &quot;from the top down&quot; in terms of research emphasis.
<a>John Jay Hopkins</a> of <a>General Dynamics Corporation</a> donated one million dollars to be used for recruiting a founding faculty.&lt;ref

name=&quot;Gribble&quot;/&gt; The graduate division of the school opened in 1960 with 20 faculty in residence; instruction was offered in the fields of <a>physics</a>, <a>biology</a>, <a>chemistry</a> and <a>earth science</a>.
Classes initially met in the Scripps Institute.&lt;ref
<p>By 1963, new facilities on the mesa been finished for the School of Science and Engineering, and new buildings were under construction for Social Sciences and Humanities.
Ten additional faculty in those disciplines were hired, and the whole site was designated the First College of the new campus.
York resigned as chancellor in 1963 and was replaced by <a>John Semple Galbraith</a> in 1964.&lt;ref

<p><a>Richard C. Atkinson</a>, chancellor from 1980-1995, strengthened UCSD's ties with the city of San Diego by encouraging <a>technology transfer</a> with developing companies, transforming San Diego into a world leader in technology-based industries.
Private giving rose from $15 million to nearly $50 million annually, faculty expanded by nearly 50%, and enrollment doubled to about 18,000 students during his chancellorship.
In 1995, the quality of UCSD's graduate programs was ranked tenth in the nation by the National Research Council.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raymond&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>

In chronological order by date of foundation, the six colleges are:</p>
<li><a>Revelle College</a>, founded in 1964 as First College, emphasizes a &quot;Renaissance education&quot; through the Humanities sequence which integrates history, literature, and philosophy.
<li><a>John Muir College</a>, founded in 1967 as Second College, emphasizes a &quot;spirit of self-sufficiency and individual choice&quot; and offers loosely structured general-education requirements.</li>
<li><a>Thurgood Marshall College</a>, founded in 1970 as Third College, emphasizes &quot;scholarship, social responsibility and the belief that a liberal arts education must include an understanding of one's role in society&quot;.</li>
<li><a>Earl Warren College</a>, founded in 1974 as Fourth College, requires students to pursue a major of their choice while also requiring two &quot;programs of concentration&quot; in disciplines unrelated to each other and to their major &quot;toward a life in balance&quot;.</li>

<li><a>Sixth College</a>, founded in 2002 with a focus on &quot;historical and philosophical connections among culture, art and technology.&quot;</li>
<p>Students affiliate with a college based upon its particular philosophy and environment as majors are not exclusive to specific colleges.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
John Muir and Earl Warren enroll the largest number of undergraduate students followed by Thurgood Marshall, Revelle, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Sixth.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Each undergraduate college sets the requirements for awarding provost's honors and honors at graduation in addition to departmental honors and <a>Phi Beta Kappa</a> honors.</p>
<p>The <a>Preuss School</a> is a <a>charter school</a> established on the UCSD campus in 1999 to provide an intensive college preparatory curriculum for <a>low-income</a> students from the greater <a>San Diego</a> area.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
