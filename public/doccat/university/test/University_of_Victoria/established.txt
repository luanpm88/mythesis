It attracts many students in part because of its size, its picturesque location, and its <a>cooperative education</a> program, which is the third largest in Canada.
<p>University of Victoria was established on 1 July 1963 in <a>Victoria, British Columbia</a> when an existing college of the <a>University of British Columbia</a> gained autonomy as a university.&lt;ref
This 60 years of history may be viewed conveniently in three distinct stages.
Between the years 1903 and 1915, Victoria College was affiliated with <a>McGill University</a>, offering first- and second-year McGill courses in Arts and Science.&lt;ref
Administered locally by the Victoria School Board, the College was an adjunct to <a>Victoria High School</a> and shared its facilities.
Both institutions were under the direction of a single Principal: E.B. Paul, 1903&#x2013;1908; and S.J. Willis, 1908-1915.</p>
<p>The opening in 1915 of the University of British Columbia, established by Act of Legislature in 1908, obliged the College to suspend operations in higher education in Victoria.
University of British Columbia was created in 1908.
A single, public provincial university, it was modeled on the American state university, with an emphasis on extension work and applied research.
The governance was modeled on the provincial University of Toronto Act of 1906 which established a bicameral system of university government consisting of a senate (faculty), responsible for academic policy, and a board of governors (citizens) exercising exclusive control over financial policy and having formal authority in all other matters.
The president, appointed by the board, was to provide a link between the two bodies and to perform institutional leadership.&lt;ref
<p>In 1920, as a result of local demands, Victoria College began the second stage of its development, reborn in affiliation with the University of British Columbia.&lt;ref
name=&quot;PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=U1ARTU0003541&quot;/&gt; Though still administered by the Victoria School Board, the College was now completely separated from Victoria High School, moving in 1921 into the magnificent Dunsmuir mansion known as <a>Craigdarroch Castle</a>.
Over the next two decades, under Principals E.B. Paul and P.H. Elliott, Victoria College built a reputation for thorough and scholarly instruction in first- and second-year Arts and Science.
It was also during this period that future author <a>Pierre Berton</a> edited and served as principal cartoonist for the student newsletter, <em>The Microscope</em>.</p>
<p>The final stage, between the years 1945 and 1963, saw the transition from two year college to university, under Principals J.M. Ewing and W.H. Hickman.&lt;ref
name=&quot;PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=U1ARTU0003541&quot;/&gt; During this period, the College was governed by the Victoria College Council, representative of the parent University of British Columbia, the Greater Victoria School Board, and the provincial Department of Education.
In 1946 the College was forced by postwar enrollment to move from Craigdarroch to the Lansdowne campus of the Provincial Normal School (This is the current location of the <a>Camosun College</a> Lansdowne Campus).
The Normal School, itself an institution with a long and honourable history, joined Victoria College in 1956 as its Faculty of Education.
Late in this transitional period (through the co-operation of the <a>Department of National Defence</a> and the <a>Hudson's Bay Company</a>) the 284 acre (1,1&nbsp;km&#x00b2;) now 385 acre (1.6&nbsp;km&#x00b2;) campus at Gordon Head was acquired.
Graduate training based on the German-inspired American model of specialized course work and the completion of a research thesis was introduced.&lt;ref
<p>The policy of university education initiated in the 1960s responded to population pressure and the belief that higher education was a key to social justice and economic productivity for individuals and for society.&lt;ref
<p>The university gained its autonomy in 1963 as the University of Victoria.&lt;ref
name=&quot;PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=U1ARTU0003541&quot;/&gt; The University Act of 1963 vested administrative authority in a chancellor elected by the convocation of the university, a board of governors, and a president appointed by the board; academic authority was given to the senate which was representative both of the faculties and of the convocation.</p>
and Badge</a>&lt;/ref&gt; The historical traditions of the university are reflected in the coat of arms, its academic regalia and its house flag.
The BSc hood, of gold, and the BEd hood, of blue, show the colours of the University of British Columbia.
Blue and gold have been retained as the official colours of the University of Victoria.
The original campus plan was prepared by the <a>San Francisco</a> architecture and planning firm of <a>Wurster, Bernardi &amp; Emmons</a>.
Outside of Ring Road are the parking lots, Student Union Building, residence buildings, the sports facilities as well as some of the academic facilities that are more self contained (Law and Theatre for example).

As of May 2010, the University has begun trapping and <a>euthanizing</a> the bunnies &lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; as they have been known to put athletes at risk in the playing fields.
However the university believes that it needs to act quickly on the matter and will consider sterilizing the remaining bunnies later.</p>
