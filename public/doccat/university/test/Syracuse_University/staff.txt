The <a>Genesee Wesleyan Seminary</a> was founded in 1832 by the Genesee <a>Annual Conference</a> of the <a>Methodist Episcopal Church</a> in Lima, New York, south of <a>Rochester</a>.
The college began looking for a new home at the same time that Syracuse, ninety miles to the east, was engaged in a search to bring a university to the city, having failed to convince <a>Ezra Cornell</a> and <a>Andrew Dickson White</a> to locate <a>Cornell University</a> there rather than in <a>Ithaca</a>.
and thereafter considered Syracuse a <a>Sodom and Gomorrah</a> insisting that the university be located in <a>Ithaca</a> on his large farm on East Hill, overlooking the town and <a>Cayuga Lake</a>.</p>
At the time, the ministers wanted a share of the funds from the <a>Morrill Land Grant Act</a> for Genesee College.
Eventually, they agreed to a quid-pro quo donation of $25,000 from Ezra Cornell in exchange for their support for his bill.
<p>The growth of Syracuse University from a small liberal arts college into a major comprehensive university were due to the efforts of two men, Chancellor <a>James Day</a> and <a>John Archbold</a>.
