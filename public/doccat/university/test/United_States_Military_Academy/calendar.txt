<p>Besides the integration of southern-state and African-American cadets, the post-war academy also struggled with the issue of <a>hazing</a>.
Hazing at the academy entered the national spotlight with the death of former cadet Oscar Booz in 1901.
name=&quot;ww1&quot;/&gt; Many of the academy's most famous graduates graduated during the 15-year period between 1900 and 1915: <a>Douglas MacArthur</a> (1903), <a>Joseph Stilwell</a> (1904), <a>Henry &quot;Hap&quot; Arnold</a> (1907), <a>George S. Patton</a> (1909), <a>Dwight D. Eisenhower</a>, and <a>Omar Bradley</a> (both 1915).

<p><a>thumb|left|First female graduates in 1980</a> In 1985, cadets were formally authorized to declare an academic major; all previous graduates had been awarded a general bachelor of science degree.
The central cadet parade ground, <a>the Plain</a>, hosts the largest number, and includes the <a>Washington Monument</a>, <a>Thayer Monument</a>, <a>Eisenhower Monument</a>, <a>MacArthur Monument</a>, <a>Kosciuszko Monument</a>, and <a>Sedgwick Monument</a>.
There is also a statue commemorating brotherhood and friendship from the <a>Ecole Polytechnique</a> in the cadet central area just outside Nininger Hall.
<p><a>right|thumb|West Point Cemetery</a> The <a>West Point Cemetery</a> is the final resting place of many notable graduates and faculty, including <a>George Armstrong Custer</a>, <a>Winfield Scott</a>, <a>William Westmoreland</a>, <a>Earl Blaik</a>, <a>Maggie Dixon</a>, and sixteen <a>Medal of Honor</a> recipients.&lt;ref

<p>The visitor's center is just outside the Thayer Gate in the village of <a>Highland Falls</a> and offers the opportunity to arrange for a guided tour.
These tours, which are the only way the general public can access the academy grounds, leave the visitor's center several times a day.

The academy is a direct reporting unit, and as such, the Superintendent reports directly to the <a>Army Chief of Staff (CSA)</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>There are two other general officer positions at the academy.
<a>Brigadier General</a> William E. Rapp is the Commandant of Cadets,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and Brigadier General Timothy Trainor is the Dean of the Academic Board.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
There are 13 academic departments at USMA, each with a colonel as the head of department.
The BOV is a panel of Senators, Congressional Representatives, and presidential appointees who &quot;shall inquire into the morale and discipline, curriculum, instruction, physical equipment, fiscal affairs, academic methods, and other matters relating to the academy that the board decides to consider&quot;.
Currently the BOV is chaired by Senator <a>Kay Bailey Hutchison</a> and is composed of four Senators, five Congressmen, and six presidential appointees.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
The nomination process typically consists of writing essays, obtaining letters of recommendation, and a formal interview.&lt;ref
name=&quot;Carnegie&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Class2012&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Candidates must be between 17 and 23 years old, unmarried, and with no legal obligation to support a child.
Above average high school or previous college grades and strong performance on standardized testing is expected.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
<p><a>thumb|upright|right|Class of 2008 toss their hats after &quot;class dismissed&quot;</a> West Point is a medium-sized, highly residential baccalaureate college, with a full-time, four-year undergraduate program that emphasizes instruction in the arts, sciences, and professions with no graduate program.
&lt;ref name=&quot;Carnegie&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; There are 45&nbsp;academic majors and the most popular majors are in foreign languages, management information systems, history, economics, and mechanical engineering.
<p>A cadet's class rank, which determines his army branch and assignment upon graduation, is calculated as a combination of academic performance&nbsp;(55%), military leadership performance&nbsp;(30%), and physical fitness and athletic performance&nbsp;(15%).&lt;ref name=&quot;fullfillmission&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The 2008 <em><a>Forbes</a></em> magazine report on America's Best Colleges ranks West Point #4 nationally and #1 among public institutions.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
<p>The academic program consists of a structured core of 31&nbsp;courses balanced between the arts and sciences.&lt;ref
name=&quot;ov&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Academy operates on the semester system, which it labels as &quot;terms&quot; (Term 1 is the fall semester; Term 2 is the spring semester).
Although cadets choose their majors in the fall of their sophomore year, they take the same course of instruction until the beginning of their junior year.&lt;ref
name=CurriculumBriefing&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This core course of instruction consists of mathematics, information technology, chemistry, physics, engineering, history, physical geography, philosophy, leadership and general psychology, English composition and literature, foreign language, political science, international relations, economics, and constitutional law.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Regardless of major, all cadets graduate with a Bachelor of Science degree.&lt;ref
<p><a>right|thumb|Cadets cross a rope bridge during summer training</a> All cadets receive commissioning as Second Lieutenants upon graduation, so military and leadership education is nested with academic instruction.
Military training and discipline fall under purview of the Office of the Commandant.
Their second summer, cadets undergo cadet field training (CFT) at nearby Camp Buckner, where they train more advanced field craft and military skills.
The role of the TAC is to mentor, train, and teach the cadets proper standards of good order and discipline and to be good role models for the cadets.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
<p>The Department of Military Instruction (DMI) is responsible for all military arts and sciences education as well as planning and executing the cadet summer training.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

<p>All cadets take a prescribed series of physical fitness courses.
<p>As with all soldiers in the Army, cadets also must pass the <a>Army Physical Fitness Test</a> twice per year.
<h3>Moral and ethical training</h3>
<p><a>right|thumb|Class of '57 honor memorial on which the honor code is inscribed</a> Moral-ethical development occurs throughout the entirety of the cadet experience by living under the honor code and through formal leadership programs available at the academy.
These include instruction in the values of the military profession through Professional Military Ethics Education (PME&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), voluntary religious programs, interaction with staff and faculty role models, and an extensive guest-speaker program.
The foundation of the ethical code at West Point is found in the academy's motto, &quot;Duty, Honor, Country&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;motto&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>West Point's <a>Cadet Honor Code</a> reads simply that: &quot;A cadet will not lie, cheat, or steal, or tolerate those who do.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Cadets accused of violating the Honor Code face an investigative and hearing process.
<p>Throughout the four years at the academy, Cadets take PME&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; classes.
These classes start during Cadet Basic Training and run the entire breadth of their time at the academy.
<h3>Rank and organization</h3>
<a>Plebeians</a> were the lower class of ancient Roman society, while yearling is a euphemism for a year-old animal.
There are a number of theories for the origin of the term cow, however the most prevalent and probably accurate one is that cadets in years past had no leave until the end of their yearling year, when they were granted a summer long furlough.
Within each regiment there are two battalions, which consists of four companies.&lt;ref
name=&quot;murphyp10&quot;&gt;Murphy (2008), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Companies are lettered A through H, with a number signifying which regiment it belongs to.
Leadership responsibility decreases with the lower classes, with second class cadets holding the rank of cadet sergeant, third class cadets holding the rank of cadet corporal, and fourth class cadets as cadet privates.&lt;ref&gt;Neff
Most cadets are housed with one roommate, but some rooms are designed for three cadets.
name=&quot;classofficers&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They also elect a ring and crest committee, which designs the class's crest, the emblem that signifies their class and it is embossed upon their class rings.
<p>Cadets today live and work within the framework of the CLDS, which specifies the roles that a cadet plays throughout their four years at the academy.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
DCA sponsors or operates 113&nbsp;athletic and non-sport clubs.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Many cadets join several clubs during their time at the academy and find their time spent with their clubs a welcome respite from the rigors of cadet life.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
DCA is responsible for a wide range of activities that provide improved quality of life for cadets, including: three cadet-oriented restaurants,&lt;ref&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; the Cadet Store,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and the <em>Howitzer</em> and <em>Bugle Notes</em>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; <em>The Howitzer</em> is the annual yearbook, while <em>Bugle Notes</em>, also known as the &quot;plebe bible&quot;, is the manual of plebe knowledge.
Plebe knowledge is a lengthy collection of traditions, songs, poems, anecdotes, and facts about the academy, the army, the <em>Old Corps</em>, and the rivalry with Navy that all plebes must memorize during cadet basic training.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barkalow
&lt;/ref&gt; Past NFL coaches <a>Vince Lombardi</a>&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and <a>Bill Parcells</a>&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; were Army assistant coaches early in their careers.
Cadets' attendance is mandatory at football games and the Corps stands for the duration of the game.
West Point competes with Navy and <a>Air Force</a> for the <a>Commander-in-Chief's Trophy</a>.</p>
The 2005&#x2013;06 women's basketball team went 20&#x2013;11 and won the Patriot League tournament.
The head coach of that team, <a>Maggie Dixon</a>, died soon after the season at only 28 years of age.
&lt;/ref&gt; The fall season sees competition in basketball, biathlon, full-contact football, soccer, ultimate disc, and wrestling; while the spring season sees competition in combative grappling, floor hockey, orienteering, rugby, and swimming.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
<p>The Cullum number is a reference and identification number assigned to each graduate.
name=&quot;ring&quot;/&gt; One side of the ring bears the academy crest, while the other side bears the class crest and the center stone ring bears the words <em>West Point</em> and the class year.
Senior cadets receive their rings during <a>Ring Weekend</a> in the early fall of their senior year.
Otherwise the cadet will pass the exam and the course.&lt;ref&gt;Lea
<p>As part of the run-up to the Navy football game, the Corps of Cadets plays the Goat-Engineer game.&lt;ref name=&quot;gogoats&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; First played in 1907, it is a game between the &quot;Goats&quot; (the bottom half of the senior (Firstie) class academically), and the &quot;Engineers&quot; (the top half).
The game is played with full pads and helmets using <a>eight-man football</a> rules.
The location has changed over the years, with recent venues being Shea Stadium, Michie Stadium, and Daly Field.
Legend states that Army will beat Navy if the goats win, and the opposite if the engineers win.&lt;ref name=&quot;gogoats&quot;/&gt; In recent years, female cadets have begun playing a <a>flag football</a> contest, so there are now two Goat-Engineer games, played back to back the same night.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
Another tradition associated with punishment tours is that any visiting head of state has the authority to grant &quot;amnesty&quot;, releasing all cadets with outstanding hours from the remainder of their assigned tours.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
During the Civil War, graduates included <a>Hood</a>, <a>Jackson</a>, <a>Lee</a>, <a>Longstreet</a>, <a>Meade</a>, <a>Sheridan</a>, <a>Sherman</a>, and <a>Stuart</a>.
During the <a>Vietnam War</a>, notable graduates general officers included <a>Abrams</a>, <a>Moore</a>, and <a>Westmoreland</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; West Point also produced some famous generals and statesmen of recent note including <a>Abizaid</a>, <a>Clark</a>, <a>Haig</a>, <a>McCaffrey</a>, <a>Schwarzkopf</a>, and <a>Scowcroft</a>.
The official alumni association of West Point is the West Point Association of Graduates (WPAOG or AOG), headquartered at Herbert Hall.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
