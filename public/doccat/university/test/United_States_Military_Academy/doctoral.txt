Students are officers-in-training and are referred to as <a>cadets</a>.
Graduates are <a>commissioned</a> as <a>second lieutenants</a>.
Instead they are officially called fourth class, third class, second class, and first class cadets.
Colloquially, freshmen are <em>plebes</em>, sophomores are <em>yearlings</em> or <em>yuks</em>, juniors are <em>cows</em>, and seniors are <em>firsties</em>.&lt;ref&gt;Atkinson
For example, there are four &quot;A&quot; companies: A1, A2, A3, and A4.
Cadets who get into trouble frequently and spend many weekends &quot;walking off their hours&quot; are known as &quot;area birds&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
