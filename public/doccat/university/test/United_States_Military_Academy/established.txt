The military garrison at West Point was occupied in 1778 and played a key role in the <a>Revolutionary War</a>.
<p>Because of the academy's age and unique mission, its traditions influenced other institutions.
It was the first American college to have <a>class ring</a>s, and its technical curriculum was a model for later engineering schools.
Its alumni and students are collectively referred to as &quot;The Long Gray Line&quot; and its ranks include two <a>Presidents of the United States</a>, numerous famous <a>generals</a>, and seventy-four <a>Medal of Honor</a> recipients.</p>
<p>The <a>Continental Army</a> first occupied West Point, New York, on 27&nbsp;January&nbsp;1778,&lt;ref&gt;Crackel (1991), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; making it the longest continually occupied post in the United States of America.&lt;ref&gt;Palka
The Great <a>Hudson River Chain</a> and high ground above the narrow &quot;S&quot; curve in the river enabled the <a>Continental Army</a> to prevent <a>British Royal Navy</a> ships from sailing upriver and dividing the Colonies.&lt;ref&gt;Crackel
As commander of the fortifications at West Point, however, <a>Benedict Arnold</a> committed his infamous act of <a>treason</a>, attempting to sell the fort to the British.&lt;ref
name=&quot;treason&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SpyLetters&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; After Arnold betrayed the patriot cause, the Army changed the name of the fortifications at West Point, New York, to <a>Fort Clinton</a>.&lt;ref
<p>&quot;Cadets&quot; underwent training in artillery and engineering studies at the garrison since 1794.&lt;ref
The academy graduated <a>Joseph Gardner Swift</a>, its first official graduate, in October 1802; he later returned as Superintendent from 1812 to 1814.&lt;ref name=&quot;earlyyears&quot;/&gt; In its tumultuous early years, the academy featured few standards for admission or length of study.
Cadets ranged in age from 10 years to 37 years and attended between 6&nbsp;months to 6&nbsp;years.&lt;ref
name=&quot;earlyyears&quot;/&gt; The impending <a>War of 1812</a> caused the <a>United States Congress</a> to authorize a more formal system of education at the academy and increased the size of the Corps of Cadets to 250.&lt;ref name =&quot;earlyyears&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p><a>left|thumb|upright|Thayer monument</a> In 1817, <a>Colonel</a> <a>Sylvanus Thayer</a> became the Superintendent and established the curriculum still in use to this day.
(1989), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Founded to be a school of engineering, for the first half of the 19th&nbsp;century, USMA produced graduates who gained recognition for engineering the bulk of the nation's initial railway lines, bridges, harbors and roads.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref

It was so successful in its engineering curriculum that it significantly influenced every American engineering school founded prior to the <a>Civil War</a>.&lt;ref
<p>The <a>Mexican&#x2013;American War</a> brought the academy to prominence as graduates proved themselves in battle for the first time.
Future <a>Civil War</a> commanders <a>Ulysses S. Grant</a> and <a>Robert E. Lee</a> first distinguished themselves in battle in Mexico.&lt;ref
In all, 452 of 523 graduates who served in the war received battlefield promotions or awards for bravery.&lt;ref
The school experienced a rapid modernization during the 1850s, often romanticized by the graduates who led both sides of the Civil War as the &quot;end of the Old West Point era&quot;.&lt;ref
name=&quot;Mexican War&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; New barracks brought better heat and <a>gas lighting</a>, while new ordnance and tactics training incorporated new <a>rifle</a> and <a>musket</a> technology and accommodated transportation advances created by the steam engine.&lt;ref
Two hundred ninety-four graduates served as general officers for the Union, and one hundred fifty-one served as general officers for the Confederacy.&lt;ref
name=&quot;Mexican War&quot;/&gt; Nearly every general officer of note from either army during the Civil War was a graduate of West Point and a West Point graduate commanded the forces of one or both sides in every one of the 60 major battles of the war.&lt;ref
Ossian Flipper|Henry O. Flipper]]&lt;/center&gt;]] Immediately following the Civil War, the academy enjoyed unprecedented fame as a result of the role its graduates had played.&lt;ref&gt;Crackel
However, the post-war years were a difficult time for the academy as it struggled to admit and reintegrate cadets from former confederate states.&lt;ref
name=&quot;postcw&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The first cadets from Southern states were re-admitted in 1868, and 1870 saw the admission of the first African-American cadet, James Webster Smith of <a>South Carolina</a>.&lt;ref
Smith endured harsh treatment and was eventually dismissed for academic deficiency under controversial circumstances in 1874.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
As a result, <a>Henry O. Flipper</a> of <a>Georgia</a> became the first African-American graduate in 1877, graduating 50th in a class of 76.&lt;ref name=&quot;postcw&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crackel (2002), pp.
Two of the most notable graduates during this period were <a>George Washington Goethals</a> from the class of 1880, and <a>John J. Pershing</a> from the class of 1886.&lt;ref
name=&quot;postcw&quot;/&gt; Goethals gained prominence as the chief engineer of the <a>Panama Canal</a>,&lt;ref&gt;Poughkeepsie (2003), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; and Pershing would become famous for his exploits against the famed <a>Pancho Villa</a> in Mexico and later for leading American Forces during World War I.&lt;ref&gt;Poughkeepsie (2003), p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
In its first 65&nbsp;years, hazing was uncommon or non-existent beyond small pranks played upon the incoming freshmen, but took a harsher tone as Civil War veterans began to fill the incoming freshman classes.
The upper class cadets saw it as their duty to &quot;teach the plebes their manners&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose
Congressional hearings, which included testimony by <a>Douglas MacArthur</a>, investigated his death and the pattern of systemic hazing of freshmen.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
When MacArthur returned as superintendent, he made an effort to end the practice of hazing the incoming freshmen by placing Army Sergeants in charge of training new cadets during freshman summer.&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose,

<p>The demand for junior officers during the <a>Spanish American War</a> caused the class of 1899 to graduate early, and the <a>Philippine-American War</a> did the same for the class of 1901.
This increased demand for officers led Congress to increase the size of the Corps of Cadets to 481&nbsp;cadets in 1900.&lt;ref
name=&quot;ww1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The period between 1900 and 1915 saw a construction boom as much of West Point's old infrastructure was rebuilt.&lt;ref
The class of 1915 is known as &quot;<a>the class the stars fell on</a>&quot; for the exceptionally high percentage of general officers that rose from that class (59 of 164).&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simpson
With war raging in Europe, Congress anticipated potential American involvement and increased the authorized strength to 1,332 cadets in 1916.
The outbreak of America's involvement in World War I caused a sharp increase in the demand for army officers, and the academy accelerated the graduation for all three of the upper classes to meet this requirement.
By the war's end in 1918, only the freshman cadets remained (those who had entered in the summer of 1918).&lt;ref
<p>Douglas MacArthur became superintendent in 1919, instituting sweeping reforms to the academic process, including introducing a greater emphasis on history and <a>humanities</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
He made major changes to the field training regimen and the Cadet Honor Committee was formed under his watch in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose
MacArthur was a firm supporter of athletics at the academy, as he famously said &quot;Upon the fields of friendly strife are sown the seeds that, upon other fields, on other days, will bear the fruits of victory.&quot;&lt;ref
West Point was first officially accredited in 1925, and in 1933 began granting bachelor of science degrees to all graduates.&lt;ref
<p>As <a>World War II</a> (WWII) engulfed Europe, Congress authorized an increase to 2,496 cadets in 1942, and began graduating classes early.
name=&quot;wwII&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; To accommodate this accelerated schedule, summer training was formally moved to a recently acquired piece of land southwest of main post.
West Point played a prominent role in WWII; four out of five of the five-star generals were alumni and nearly 500&nbsp;graduates died.&lt;ref
name=&quot;wwII&quot;/&gt; Immediately following the war in 1945, <a>Maxwell Taylor</a> (class of 1922) became superintendent.
More than half of the army leadership during the war was composed of academy graduates.
As a result, 157&nbsp;alumni perished in the conflict.&lt;ref
name=&quot;coldwar&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; <a>Garrison H. Davidson</a> became superintendent in 1956 and instituted several reforms that included refining the admissions process, changing the core curriculum to include electives, and increasing the academic degree standards for academy instructors.&lt;ref
West Point was not immune to the social upheaval of American society during the <a>Vietnam War</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The first woman joined the faculty of the all-male institution amidst controversy in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The Army granted its first <a>honorable discharge</a> to a West Point graduate who claimed <a>conscientious objector</a> status in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The academy struggled to fill its incoming classes as its graduates led troops in Southeast Asia, where 273 graduates died.&lt;ref
<p>Following the 1973 <a>Paris Peace Accords</a> that ended American involvement in Vietnam, the strain and stigma of earlier social unrest dissolved and West Point enjoyed surging enrollments.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
West Point admitted its first 119&nbsp;female cadets in 1976, after Congress authorized the admission of women to the federal service academies in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref
name=&quot;1stwomen&quot;&gt;Barkalow (1990), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Women currently comprise approximately 15% of entering new cadets.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Two other females have been appointed as First Captain: Grace H. Chung in 2004 and Stephanie Hightower in 2006.
The first female West Point graduate to attain flag (general officer) rank was Rebecca Halstead, class of 1981.
Five years later there was a major revision of the &quot;Fourth Class System&quot;, as the Cadet Leader Development System (CLDS) became the guidance for the development of all four classes.&lt;ref
<p>The class of 1990 was the first one to be issued a standard and mandatory computer to every Cadet, the <a>Zenith Data Systems</a> 248.
The academy was also an early adopter of the Internet in the mid 1990s, and was recognized in 2006 as one of the nation's &quot;most wired&quot; campuses.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>During the <a>Gulf War</a>, alumnus General <a>Schwarzkopf</a> was the commander of Allied Forces, and the current American senior generals in <a>Iraq</a>, Generals <a>Petraeus</a> and <a>Odierno</a>, and Afghanistan, retired General <a>Stanley McChrystal</a> and Lieutenant General <a>David Rodriguez</a>, are also alumni.
Following the <a>11 September attacks</a>, applications for admission to the academy increased dramatically, security on campus was increased, and the curriculum was revamped to include coursework on terrorism and military drills in civilian environments.&lt;ref
name=&quot;Sept11&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; One graduate was killed during the 9/11 terrorist attacks and eighty graduates have died during operations related to <a>Operation Iraqi Freedom</a> and the ongoing <a>Global War on Terror</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
In December 2009, President <a>Barack Obama</a> delivered a major speech in Eisenhower Hall Theater outlining his policy for <a>deploying 30,000 additional troops</a> to <a>Afghanistan</a> as well as setting a timetable for withdrawal.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
Based on the significance both of the <a>Revolutionary War</a> fort ruins and of the military academy itself, the majority of the academy area was declared a <a>National Historic Landmark</a> in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Candidates may have previous college experience, but they may not transfer, meaning that regardless of previous college credit, they enter the academy as a fourth class cadet and undergo the entire four-year program.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Upon graduation from USMAPS, these candidates are appointed to the academy if they receive the recommendation of the USMAPS Commandant and meet medical admission requirements.&lt;ref&gt;
The scholarships usually cover around $7000 to civilian universities; the students who receive these scholarships do so under the stipulation that they will be admitted to and attend West Point a year later.
New Mexico Military Institute, Marion Military Institute, and Valley Forge Military College are three colleges that students often attend on the AOG scholarship prior to admission to West Point.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>

If they are found guilty by a jury of their peers, they face severe consequences ranging from being &quot;turned back&quot; (repeating an academic year) to separation from the academy.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Cadets previously enforced an unofficial sanction known as &quot;silencing&quot; by not speaking to cadets accused of violating the honor code, but the practice ended in 1973 after national scrutiny.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
As the cadets mature in rank and experience, they transform from receivers of information to facilitators and teachers of PME&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; topics.
First class cadets hold the leadership positions within the brigade from the First Captain down to platoon leaders within the companies.

Cadets begin their USMA careers as trainees (new cadets), then advance in rank, starting as CDT Privates (freshmen) and culminating as CDT Officers (seniors).
Freshmen have no leadership responsibilities, but have a host of duties to perform as they learn how to follow orders and operate in an environment of rigid rank structure, while seniors have significant leadership responsibilities and significantly more privileges that correspond to their rank.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>

<p>Due to West Point's age and its unique mission of producing Army officers, it has many time-honored traditions.
It was created by <a>brevet</a> Major General <a>George W. Cullum</a> (USMA Class of 1833) who, in 1850, began the monumental work of chronicling the biographies of every graduate.
He assigned number one to the first West Point graduate, <a>Joseph Gardner Swift</a>, and then numbered all successive graduates in sequence.
Before his death in 1892, General Cullum completed the first three volumes of a work that eventually comprised 10&nbsp;volumes, entitled <em>General Cullum&#x2019;s Biographical Register of the Officers and Graduates of the United States Military Academy, and covering USMA classes from 1802 through 1850</em>.
From 1802 through the Class of 1977, graduates were listed by general order of Merit.
Beginning with the Class of 1978, graduates were listed alphabetically, and then by date of graduation.
For various reasons these graduates were omitted from the original class roster, and a suffix letter was added to avoid renumbering the entire class and subsequent classes.&lt;ref

name=&quot;AR210-26&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This process is better known to the cadets as &quot;walking the area&quot; or &quot;hours&quot; because as punishment, cadets must walk a specified number of hours in retribution.
Being late to class or having an unkempt room may result in as little as 5 hours while more severe misconduct infractions may result in upwards of 60 to 80 hours.
In its most traditional form, punishment tours are &quot;walked off&quot; by wearing the dress gray uniform under arms and walking back and forth in a designated area of the cadet barracks courtyard, known as &quot;the area&quot;.
Cadets who walk more than 100 total hours in their career are affectionately known as &quot;Century Men&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
