A second concentration or a <a>minor</a> also satisfies this requirement.
The only exceptions are students concentrating in an <a>accredited</a> <a>engineering</a> field (<a>biomedical engineering</a>, <a>chemical engineering</a>, <a>electrical and computer engineering</a> or <a>mechanical engineering</a>), who are only required to have one cluster in either humanities or social sciences.</p>
