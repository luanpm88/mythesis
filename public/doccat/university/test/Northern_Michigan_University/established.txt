<p><a>thumb|250px|Dating back to 1907 and originally located on the corner of Kaye and Presque Isle, the Heart of Northern was long a landmark of NMU.
After falling into a severe state of neglect by the end of the 20th century, a new mound was created closer to the center of campus in time for its Centennial Celebration in 1999.</a></p>
<p>Northern Michigan University, NMU for short, was established in 1899 by the <a>Michigan Legislature</a> as Northern State Normal School with the original purpose of providing teacher preparation programs in Michigan's then-wild and sparsely populated <a>Upper Peninsula</a>.
When it opened its doors in 1899, Northern enrolled thirty-two students who were taught by six faculty members utilizing rented rooms in Marquette City Hall.
The original  campus-site at the corner of Presque Isle and Kaye Avenues was on land donated by local businessman and philanthropist John M. Longyear, whose namesake academic building, Longyear Hall, opened its doors to students in 1900.</p>
<p>Throughout the school's first half century, education and teacher training was the primary focus of the small regional school.
During this time, the school built the native sandstone buildings Kaye and Peter White Halls, as well as a manual training school adjacent to the campus buildings, J.D. Pierce School.
Modest increases in enrollment resulted in several name changes throughout the years: &lt;br&gt;</p>
<p>In 1963, through the adoption of a new state constitution in Michigan, Northern was designated as a comprehensive university serving the diverse educational needs of Upper Michigan.
<p>Graduate education was inaugurated in 1928 when courses at the master&#x2019;s degree level were offered in cooperation with the <a>University of Michigan</a>.
In 1960, Northern established its own graduate program.</p>
<li>Northern's multi-purpose student events center, funded in part by a $2 million donation by 1971 alumnus John Berry, opened in 1999 and is the home of the Northern Michigan University hockey and men's and women's basketball teams.
<li>Opened in 1958 as the university's fieldhouse, this building now houses the offices of the Dean of Students, Admissions, Registrar, Financial Aid, Housing and Residence Life, Multicultural Education, and other student services.
The primary classroom building on campus, this building is named for former university president John X. Jamrich and opened in 1968.</li>
<li>Physical Education Instructional Facility (PEIF) opened in 1976.
This initiative makes NMU one of the largest public university <a>laptop</a> programs in the world.
The university has national and international awards for its innovative work in the area of technology in higher education.</p>
NMU is the first public university in Michigan &mdash; but one of many nationwide &mdash; to pursue the idea of a &quot;laptop&quot; campus.
<p>The university has a help desk and walk-in service center to handle laptop maintenance problems.</p>

Northern Michigan's rivals in sports action are the two other major schools in the upper peninsula; Michigan Tech University, and Lake Superior State University.
<p>With more than 70 resident athletes and coaches, the USOEC is the second-largest Olympic training center in the United States, in terms of residents, behind <a>Colorado Springs</a>.
The student athletes receive free or reduced room and board, access to world-class training facilities as well as sports medicine and sports science services, academic tutoring, and a waiver of out-of-state tuition fees by NMU.
