staff$$$@@@%%%<p><strong>Northern Michigan University</strong> is a 4 year college <a>public university</a> established in 1899 located in <a>Marquette</a>, in <a>Michigan</a>'s <a>Upper Peninsula</a>.
postgrad$$$@@@%%%With a population of nearly 10,000 undergraduate and graduate students, Northern Michigan University is the Upper Peninsula's largest university.</p>
image_size$$$@@@%%%<h2>History</h2>
established$$$@@@%%%<p><a>thumb|250px|Dating back to 1907 and originally located on the corner of Kaye and Presque Isle, the Heart of Northern was long a landmark of NMU.
established$$$@@@%%%After falling into a severe state of neglect by the end of the 20th century, a new mound was created closer to the center of campus in time for its Centennial Celebration in 1999.</a></p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Northern Michigan University, NMU for short, was established in 1899 by the <a>Michigan Legislature</a> as Northern State Normal School with the original purpose of providing teacher preparation programs in Michigan's then-wild and sparsely populated <a>Upper Peninsula</a>.
established$$$@@@%%%When it opened its doors in 1899, Northern enrolled thirty-two students who were taught by six faculty members utilizing rented rooms in Marquette City Hall.
established$$$@@@%%%The original  campus-site at the corner of Presque Isle and Kaye Avenues was on land donated by local businessman and philanthropist John M. Longyear, whose namesake academic building, Longyear Hall, opened its doors to students in 1900.</p>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>Throughout the school's first half century, education and teacher training was the primary focus of the small regional school.
established$$$@@@%%%During this time, the school built the native sandstone buildings Kaye and Peter White Halls, as well as a manual training school adjacent to the campus buildings, J.D. Pierce School.
established$$$@@@%%%Modest increases in enrollment resulted in several name changes throughout the years: &lt;br&gt;</p>

president$$$@@@%%%  <li>Northern Michigan College, 1955</li>
image_size$$$@@@%%%</ul>
established$$$@@@%%%<p>In 1963, through the adoption of a new state constitution in Michigan, Northern was designated as a comprehensive university serving the diverse educational needs of Upper Michigan.
mottoeng$$$@@@%%%During this time, enrollment at the small state school swelled (due in large part to the opening in 1957 of the Mackinac Straits Bridge, linking the Upper and Lower Peninsulas to vehicle traffic) and as a result, the campus expanded rapidly; roughly to the size it remains to this day.
calendar$$$@@@%%%Accredited undergraduate and graduate degree programs are offered by the College of Arts and Sciences, the College of Business, the College of Professional Studies.
