<p>The <strong>University of Arizona</strong> (also referred to as <strong>UA</strong>, <strong>U of A</strong>, or <strong>Arizona</strong>) is a <a>land-grant</a> and <a>space-grant</a> <a>public</a> institution of <a>higher education</a> and <a>research</a> located in <a>Tucson, Arizona</a>, United States.
The University of Arizona was the first <a>university</a> in the state of <a>Arizona</a>, founded in 1885 (twenty-seven years before the Arizona Territory achieved statehood).
The university includes the <a>University of Arizona College of Medicine</a> which is one of three medical schools and the only <a>MD</a> granting medical school in Arizona.
As of Fall 2008, total enrollment was 38,057 students.&lt;ref
name=&quot;Fact Book&quot;/&gt; The University of Arizona is governed by the <a>Arizona Board of Regents</a>.
The mission of the University of Arizona is, &quot;To discover, educate, serve, and inspire.&quot;&lt;ref
<p><a>right|thumb|200px|Old Main, the oldest building on the University of Arizona campus</a> The University of Arizona was approved by the Arizona Territory's &quot;<a>Thieving Thirteenth</a>&quot; Legislature in 1885.
The city of Tucson had hoped to receive the appropriation for the territory's mental hospital, which carried a $100,000 allocation instead of the $25,000 allotted to the territory's only university (Arizona State University was also chartered in 1885, but at the time it was created as Arizona's <a>normal school</a>, and not a university).
<a>Tucson</a>'s contingent of legislators was delayed in reaching <a>Prescott</a> due to flooding on the <a>Salt River</a> and by the time they arrived back-room deals allocating the most desirable territorial institutions had already been made.
Tucson was largely disappointed at receiving what was viewed as an inferior prize.
name=&quot;History 3&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Because there were no high schools in Arizona Territory, the University maintained separate preparatory classes for the first 23 years of operation.

<p>A downturn in Arizona's economy in the 2000s led to less money being allocated by the state legislature to Arizona's universities.
Academic programs were hard-hit, and the university was forced to consider extensive changes, beginning in 2002.
As a result, a reorganization known as Focused Excellence aimed to focus the mission of the university on research, graduate training, and more selective undergraduate education, in part, by eliminating and merging less popular and low-revenue academic departments.
The closure of some programs, notably the innovative Arizona International College and the School of Planning, provoked widespread protest.
However, efforts to improve academic performance and to encourage new research areas were not enough to prevent a number of key departures from the faculty in the early 2000s, and budgets remain restricted.
Focused Excellence was quietly wound up in 2006 and its website removed, but President Robert Shelton's Dec. 2006 <a>message to the University</a> suggested further retrenchment is essential in the light of funding cuts.</p>

<p>UA is a member of the <a>Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy</a>, a consortium of institutions pursuing research in astronomy.
Led by Roger Angel, researchers in the <a>Steward Observatory</a> Mirror Lab at UA are working in concert to build the world's most advanced telescope.
Known as the <a>Giant Magellan Telescope</a>, the instrument will produce images 10 times sharper than those from the Earth-orbiting <a>Hubble Telescope</a>.
Researchers from at least nine institutions are working to secure the funding for the project.
The mirrors of the Giant Magellan Telescope will be built at the U of A and transported to a permanent mountaintop site in the <a>Chile</a>an <a>Andes</a> where the telescope will be constructed.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
The project is expected to be in its Primary Science Phase in the month of October.&lt;!-- LINK DEAD?<a>http://uanews.opi.arizona.edu/cgi-bin/WebObjects/UANews.woa/1/wa/SRStoryDetails?ArticleID=11437</a> --&gt; Currently operating on the surface of <a>Mars</a> is the Lander known as the <a>Phoenix Scout Mission</a>, led by the U of A Scientist Peter Smith.

<p><a>thumb|right|Entrance to the U of A main library</a> In 2005, the <a>Association of Research Libraries</a>, in its &quot;Ranked Lists for Institutions for 2005&quot; (the most recent year available), ranked the UA libraries as the 33rd overall university library in North America (out of 113) based on various statistical measures of quality; this is one rank below the library of <a>Duke University</a>, one rank ahead of that of <a>Northwestern University</a>.&lt;ref&gt;<a>ARL.org</a>&lt;/ref&gt;
<p>As of 2009, the UA's library system contains over five million print volumes, 600,000 electronic books, and 54,000 electronic journals.
The Main Library, opened in 1976, serves as the library system's reference, periodical, and administrative center; most of the main collections and special collections are housed here as well.
Much of the ILC was constructed underground, underneath the east end of the Mall; the ILC connects to the basement floor of the Main Library through the Information Commons.
As part of the project, additional new office space for the Library was constructed on the existing fifth floor.</p>
<p>The Science and Engineering Library is in a nearby building from the 1960s that houses volumes and periodicals from those fields.
The Law Library is in the law building (James E. Rogers College of Law), located at the intersection of Speedway Boulevard and Mountain Avenue.</p>
<p>The libraries at University of Arizona are expecting a 15 percent budget cut for the 2009 fiscal year.
They will begin to explore the possibilities of cutting collections, staff, and face-to-face instruction.
They also intend to cut a face-face instructional program that teaches students in English 101 and 102 how to navigate the library.
<p><a>The University of Arizona Poetry Center</a> is among the nation&#x2019;s finest and most extensive collections of contemporary poetry.
<p><a>right|thumb|300px|Student Union, Old Main, and Forbes building</a> The main campus sits on in central Tucson, about one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) northeast of downtown.
It was Place's use of red brick that set the tone for the red brick facades that are a basic and ubiquitous part of nearly all UA buildings, even those built in recent decades.
<p>The science and mathematics buildings tend to be clustered in the southwest quadrant; the intercollegiate athletics facilities to the southeast; the arts and humanities buildings to the northwest (with the dance department being a major exception as its main facilities are far to the east end of campus), with the engineering buildings in the north central area.
The area near University Boulevard and Park Avenue, near the Main Gate, has been a major center of such retail activity going back to the university's early decades; many shops dating from the 1920s have been renovated since the late 1990s, other new retail shops have been built in recent years, and a nine-story <a>Marriott</a> hotel was built in this immediate district in 1996.
Most of the buildings east of Old Main date from the 1940s to the 1980s, with a few recent buildings constructed in the years since 1990.</p>
<p><a>right|thumb|Student Union Memorial Center</a> The Student Union Memorial Center, located on the north side of the Mall east of Old Main, was completely reconstructed between 2000 and 2003, replacing a structure originally opened in 1951 (with additions in the 1960s).
A <a>bell</a> housed on the <a>USS Arizona</a>, one of the two bells rescued from the ship after the <a>attack on Pearl Harbor</a>, has a permanent home in the clock tower of the Student Union Memorial Center on campus.
(The university also manages <a>Boyce Thompson Arboretum State Park</a>, located in rural <a>Pinal County</a> about north of the main campus.)
<p>The Stevie Eller Dance Theatre, opened in 2003 (across the Mall from <a>McKale Center</a>) as a dedicated performance venue for the UA's dance program, one of the most highly regarded university dance departments in the United States.
Designed by Gould Evans, a Phoenix-based architectural firm, the theatre was awarded the 2003 Citation Award from the <a>American Institute of Architects</a>, Arizona Chapter.&lt;ref&gt;<a>CFA.arizona.edu</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>

<p>The University of Arizona generates renewable energy with solar panels that have been installed on campus buildings.
<p>The University of Arizona, like its sister institutions <a>Arizona State University</a> and <a>Northern Arizona University</a>, is governed by the <a>Arizona Board of Regents</a> or the ABOR, a 12-member body.
According to information published by the ABOR office and available on their Web site, eight volunteer members are appointed by the Governor to staggered eight-year terms; two students serve on the Board for two-year appointments, with the first year being a nonvoting apprentice year.
The Governor and the Superintendent of Public Instruction serve as voting ex-officio members.
The ABOR provides &quot;policy guidance&quot; and oversight to the three major degree-granting universities, as provided for by Title 15 of the <a>Arizona Revised Statutes</a>.</p>
name=&quot;Swedlund&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Notable past UA presidents include Likins, Manuel Pacheco (the first person of <a>Hispanic</a> descent to lead the university and for whom the <a>Integrated Learning Center</a> is named), <a>Homer L. Shantz</a>, Henry Koffler, John Schaefer, and Richard Harvill.&lt;ref&gt;<a>&quot;Past Presidents of The University of Arizona&quot;, from UA Office of the President website.
name=&quot;History 8&quot;&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; The University of Arizona participates in the <a>NCAA</a>'s Division I-A in the <a>Pacific-10 Conference</a>, which it joined in 1978.</p>
<p> The <a>men's basketball</a> team has been one of the nation's most successful programs since <a>Lute Olson</a> was hired as head coach in 1983, and is still known as a national powerhouse in Division I men's basketball.&lt;ref&gt;via
The Wildcats have reached the <a>Final Four</a> of the NCAA tournament in <a>1988</a>, <a>1994</a>, <a>1997</a>, and <a>2001</a>.
In 1997, Arizona defeated the <a>University of Kentucky</a>, the defending national champions, to win the NCAA National Championship (<a>NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship</a>) by a score of 84&ndash;79 in overtime; Arizona's first national championship victory.
The 1997 championship team became the first and only in <a>NCAA</a> history to defeat three number-one seeds en route to a national title (Kansas, North Carolina and Kentucky&#x2014;the North Carolina game being the final game for longtime UNC head coach Dean Smith).
Point guard <a>Miles Simon</a> was chosen as 1997 <a>Final Four MVP</a> (Simon was also an assistant coach under Olson from 2005&ndash;08).
Since the institution of the two-round draft system in 1989 by the NBA, no school has had more draft picks than Arizona.&lt;ref
<p>The Wildcats play their home games at the <a>McKale Center</a> in Tucson.
A number of former Wildcats have gone on to pursue successful professional NBA careers (especially during the Lute Olson era), including <a>Gilbert Arenas</a>, <a>Richard Jefferson</a>, <a>Mike Bibby</a>, <a>Jason Terry</a>, <a>Sean Elliott</a>, <a>Damon Stoudamire</a>, <a>Luke Walton</a>, <a>Hassan Adams</a>, <a>Salim Stoudamire</a>, <a>Andre Iguodala</a>, <a>Channing Frye</a>, Brian Williams (later known as <a>Bison Dele</a>), Sean Rooks, Jud Buechler, Michael Dickerson and <a>Steve Kerr</a>.
<a>Kenny Lofton</a>, now best known as a former Major League Baseball star, was a four year letter winner as a Wildcat basketball player (and was on the 1988 Final Four team), before one year on the Arizona baseball team.
<p>Before Lute Olson's hire in 1983, Arizona was the first major Division I school to hire an <a>African American</a> head coach in <a>Fred Snowden</a>, in 1972.
After a 25-year tenure as Arizona head coach, Olson announced his retirement from the Arizona basketball program in October 2008.
After two seasons of using interim coaches, Arizona named <a>Sean Miller</a>, head coach at <a>Xavier University</a>, as its new head basketball coach in April 2009.</p>
<p> <a>thumb|Arizona Stadium</a> The <a>football</a> team began at The University of Arizona in 1899 under the nickname &quot;Varsity&quot; (a name kept until the 1914 season when the team was deemed the &quot;Wildcats&quot;).&lt;ref
<p>The football team was notably successful in the 1990s, under head coach <a>Dick Tomey</a>; his &quot;Desert Swarm&quot; defense was characterized by tough, hard-nosed tactics.
In 1993, the team had its first 10-win season and beat the <a>University of Miami</a> Hurricanes in the <a>Fiesta Bowl</a> by a score of 29&ndash;0.
It was the bowl game's only shutout in its then 23-year history.
Arizona ended that season ranked 4th nationally in the coaches and API poll.
The 1998 Holiday Bowl was televised on <a>ESPN</a> and set the now-surpassed record of being the most watched of any bowl game in that network's history (the current record belongs to the 2005 <a>Alamo Bowl</a> between <a>Michigan</a> and <a>Nebraska</a>).
<p>The <a>baseball</a> team had its first season in 1905.
Arizona baseball teams have appeared in the NCAA National Championship title series a total of six times, including 1956, 1959, 1963, 1976, 1980, and 1986 (<a>College World Series</a>).
The softball team has won eight <a>NCAA</a> Women's College World Series titles, in 1991, 1993, 1994, 1996, 1997, 2001, 2006 and 2007 under head coach <a>Mike Candrea</a> (<a>NCAA Softball Championship</a>).
The team has appeared in the <a>NCAA</a> National Championship in 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 2001, 2002, 2006, 2007 and 2010 (a feat second only to <a>UCLA</a>), and has reached the College World Series 19 of the past 20 years.
In the 60&#x2019;s, Arizona was a Division I Varsity program, coached by the legendary <a>Carl Runk</a>, an Arizona graduate and football player.
Alix Creek and Michelle Oldham won the NCAA Women's Doubles Tennis title in 1993, defeating Texas in the Final.
Although surprising to some, the University of Arizona has a noteworthy history in <a>ice hockey</a>.
The school's club hockey team, known as the Icecats, has won over 600 games since its inception in 1978.
They are now part of <a>ACHA</a> Division I. Robert M. Tanita was a nationally ranked collegiate wrestler who reached the NCAA finals tournament as WAC champion in 1963.</p>
<p>Three national championships for <a>synchronized swimming</a> were won in 1980, 1981, and 1984, though these championships were in the <a>Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women</a>, and not the <a>NCAA</a>.
Along with winning three national championships in the pool for synchronized swimming, the Wildcats have also won their first <a>NCAA</a> Championship in men and women&#x2019;s <a>swimming and diving</a> for the seasons of 2007&ndash;2008.
Arizona men became the first team to claim a first-time title since UCLA&#x2019;s win in 1982.
At the end of the meet, <a>University of Texas</a> took second while 2007&#x2019;s champion, <a>Auburn University</a>, took fifth.
For the women, Arizona worked on the disappointment of 2007&#x2019;s defeat.
Student-athletes from the women's swimming and diving team have been particularly heralded by the NCAA.
The <a>NCAA Woman of the Year Award</a> was won by UA swimmers Whitney Myers, Lacey Nymeyer and Justine Schluntz in 2007, 2009 and 2010 respectively.
The three awards and the 1994 award won by track and field athlete Tanya Hughes are the highest number of Woman of the Year awards won by a single university.</p>
<p>A number of notable individuals have also won national championships in the <a>NCAA</a>.
These include <a>Amanda Beard</a> in 2001 for <a>swimming</a> and <a>Annika S&#x00f6;renstam</a> in 1991 in <a>golf</a>.
Another notable individual was football standout <a>Vance Johnson</a> who won the NCAA long jump in 1982.
Arizona's first NCAA Individual Champion in the sport of Men's Swimming came in 1981 when Doug Towne won the 500 yard freestyle at the NCAA championships.
<p>A strong athletic rivalry exists between the University of Arizona and <a>Arizona State University</a> located in <a>Tempe</a>.
The UA leads the all-time record against ASU in men's basketball (138-73), football (44&ndash;35&ndash;1), and baseball (224&ndash;189&ndash;1) as of January 2006.
<p>Wilbur was originally created by Bob White as a cartoon character in the University's humor magazine, <em>Kitty Kat</em>.
From 1915 through the 1950s the school mascot was a live <a>bobcat</a>, a species known locally as a wildcat.
This succession of live mascots were known by the common name of Rufus Arizona, originally named after Rufus von Kleinsmid, president of the university from 1914 to 1921.
1959 marked the creation of the first incarnated Wilbur, when University student John Paquette and his roommate, Dick Heller, came up with idea of creating a costume for a student to wear.
Ed Stuckenhoff was chosen to wear the costume at the homecoming game in 1959 against Texas Tech and since then it has become a long-standing tradition.
Wilbur will celebrate his 50th birthday in November 2009.</p>
<p> <strong>The Official Student Section and Student Ticketing Program for University of Arizona Athletics</strong></p>
The Zona Zoo program is co-owned by the Associated Students of the University of Arizona (ASUA) and Arizona Athletics, the program is run by a team of spirited individuals called the Zona Zoo Crew.
The largest crowd to see a game in McKale was 15,176 in 1976 for a game against the <a>University of New Mexico</a>, a main rival during that period.
In 2000, the floor in McKale was dubbed Lute Olson Court, for the basketball program's winningest coach.
<a>Arizona Stadium</a>, built in 1928 and last expanded in 1976, seats over 56,000 patrons.
The largest crowd ever in Arizona Stadium was 59,920 in 1996 for a game against Arizona State University.
<p>There are currently (2005) 44 <a>fraternity and sorority</a> chapters that are recognized by the University of Arizona.

Blue Chip was founded in 1999 and has formed a partnership with the <a>University of Wollongong</a>, in <a>Wollongong</a>, Australia where a sister program, the Black Opal Leadership Development Program&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; began in February, 2005.
Also located in the CSIL is the office of <a>Camp Wildcat</a>, a student-run non-profit service organization that was started in 1965.
Through funding from the CSIL and the Associated Students of the University of Arizona, clubs are given the resources and encouragement to explore unusual interests.</p>
<p>In 2008 University of Arizona students started <a>their own branch</a> (reinstated as of April 21, 2010&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;) of the <a>Arizona Students for Life (ASFL)</a> <a>pro-life</a> association, whose goal is to help pregnant college women and raise awareness about <a>elective abortion</a>, of which college women are half all those affected.</p>
<p>The University of Arizona is also home to one of the oldest <a>Model United Nations</a> organizations in the United States, which each year hosts several hundred students high school students in a bilingual simulation of the <a>United Nations</a> and other international bodies.</p>
Started in 1979 by Adam Goldstein, it claims to be the nation's oldest weekly college sketch and improv comedy group, though in recent years it has branched out into doing previously videotaped comedy bits and shorts as well.
Comedy Corner was the first documented college sketch comedy troupe to incorporate improvisation into its weekly shows, a practice that has become more common in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;<a>UAB
This was passed by the ASUA student government body shortly after the war in Afghanistan began in 2001.
Later in the school year, Spring Fling, an ASUA Student Government program, and the largest student-run carnival in the U.S., has been held annually by UA students since 1965, under a different name: The Rites of Spring.
The UA club, <a>Camp Wildcat</a>, initially began the festival as a fundraiser and continued to do so until the event was taken over by <a>ASUA</a> in <a>1975</a>.&lt;ref

--&gt; Overall, students at the University of Arizona have been represented by the Associated Students of the University of Arizona (ASUA) since 1913.
<p>In 1997, the <a>Graduate and Professional Student Council</a> (GPSC) split from the ASUA and has since become the <em>de-facto</em> body to represent issues specific to graduate and professional students.
Much like ASUA, the GPSC appoints representatives to serve on various University of Arizona Faculty and Administrative Committees and 1 Director to serve on the Arizona Students' Association.</p>
<p>The University of Arizona Residence Hall Association has hosted 3 regional IACURH Residence Hall Conferences, which were hosted in 1961, 1997, and 2004.
In 2005, the University of Arizona's Residence Hall Association was voted by <a>NACURH</a> (National Association of College and University Residence Halls) as the National School of the Year out of over 400 schools across the United States.
In May 2009, the University of Arizona hosted the NACURH National Residence Hall Conference (also hosted in 1963), bringing more than 2,200 on-campus residents from over 250 schools across the United States and Canada for 3 days of school spirit and learning how to become more sustainable and socially just.
<h2>Arizona in film and literature</h2>
<p>The University has made itself known through many films and television appearances.
The film <em><a>Revenge of the Nerds</a></em> (1984) was filmed at the University of Arizona.
In the 1994 film <em><a>Speed</a></em>, <a>Dennis Hopper</a> refers to <a>Sandra Bullock</a>'s character as a Wildcat because of the emblem on her sweater.
The film <em><a>Eating Out</a></em> was shot around the University of Arizona campus in Tucson.
An episode of <em><a>Little House on the Prairie</a></em>, entitled &quot;A Wiser Heart,&quot; used Old Main as a prominent backdrop throughout.
<p>The University has also been the setting for portions of <a>David Foster Wallace</a>'s novel <em><a>Infinite Jest</a></em> takes place at the University of Arizona campus, including a scene in the administration building satirizing the school's <a>bureaucracy</a>.
