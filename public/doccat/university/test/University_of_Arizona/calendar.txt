name=&quot;UA Mission&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Arizona is one of the elected members of the <a>Association of American Universities</a> (an organization of North America's premier research institutions) and is the only representative from the state of Arizona to this group.
The university maintains a current list of colleges and schools at <a>http://www.arizona.edu/index/colleges.php</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Currently, grades are given on a strict 4-point scale with &quot;A&quot; worth 4, &quot;B&quot; worth 3, &quot;C&quot; worth 2, &quot;D&quot; worth 1 and &quot;E&quot; worth zero points.
In 2004, there were discussions with students and faculty may lead the UA toward using a plus-minus grading system in the future.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The U of A laboratory designed and operated the atmospheric radiation investigations and imaging on the probe.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The association operates observatories and <a>telescopes</a>, notably <a>Kitt Peak National Observatory</a> located just outside of Tucson.
UA is a member of the <a>Association of American Universities</a>, and the sole representative from Arizona to this group.
The telescope will include seven 18-ton mirrors capable of providing clear images of <a>volcanoes</a> and riverbeds on <a>Mars</a> and <a>mountains</a> on the moon at a rate 40 times faster than the world's current large telescopes.
The <a>Arizona Radio Observatory</a>, a part of <a>Steward Observatory</a>, operates the <a>12 Meter Telescope</a> on <a>Kitt Peak</a> and the <a>Submillimeter Telescope</a> on <a>Mount Graham</a>.</p>
(both these schools are members, along with the UA, of the <a>Association of American Universities</a>).</p>
The Main Library is located on the southeast quadrant of campus near <a>McKale Center</a> and <a>Arizona Stadium</a>.</p>
<p>In 2002, a $20 million, addition, the Integrated Learning Center (ILC), was completed; it is a home base for first-year students (especially those undecided on a major) which features classrooms, auditoriums, a courtyard with an alcove for vending machines, and a greatly expanded computer lab (the Information Commons) with several dozen <a>Gateway</a> and <a>Apple Macintosh</a> G5 workstations (these computers are available for use by the general public (with some restrictions) as well as by UA students, faculty and staff).
The Music Building (on the northwest quadrant of campus where many of the fine arts disciplines are clustered) houses the Fine Arts Library, including reference collections for architecture, music (including sheet music, recordings and listening stations), and photography.
There is a small library at the <a>Center for Creative Photography</a>, also in the fine arts complex, devoted to the art and science of photography.
<h3>Academic organizations and centers</h3>
Many of the early buildings, including the <a>Arizona State Museum</a> buildings (one of them the 1927 main library) and Centennial Hall, were designed by <a>Roy Place</a>, a prominent Tucson architect.
Indeed, almost every UA building has red brick as a major component of the design, or at the very least, a stylistic accent to harmonize it with the other buildings on campus.&lt;ref&gt;<a>&quot;The
The north and south sides of campus are delineated by a grassy expanse called the Mall, which stretches from Old Main eastward to the campus' eastern border at Campbell Avenue (a major north-south arterial street).
The west and east sides of campus are separated roughly by Highland Avenue and the Student Union Memorial Center (see below).</p>
The optical and space sciences buildings are clustered on the east side of campus near the sports stadiums and the (1976) main library.</p>
<p>Speedway Boulevard, one of Tucson's primary east-west arterial streets, traditionally defined the northern boundary of campus but since the 1980s, several university buildings have been constructed north of this street, expanding into a neighborhood traditionally filled with apartment complexes and single-family homes.
Sixth Street typically defines the southern boundary, with single-family homes (many of which are rented out to students) south of this street.</p>
<p>Park Avenue has traditionally defined the western boundary of campus, and there is a stone wall which runs along a large portion of the east side of the street, leading to the old Main Gate, and into the driveway leading to Old Main.
Along or adjacent to all of these major streets are a wide variety of retail facilities serving the student, faculty and staff population (as is the case in other similar university neighborhoods throughout the United States): shops, bookstores, bars, banks, credit unions, coffeehouses and major chain fast-food restaurants such as <a>Wendy's</a>, <a>McDonald's</a> and <a>Pei Wei</a>.
The new $60 million student union has of space on four levels, including 14 restaurants (including a <a>food court</a> with such national chains as Burger King, <a>Panda Express</a>, <a>Papa John's Pizza</a> and Chick-fil-A), a new two-level bookstore (that includes a counter for <a>Clinique</a> merchandise as well as an office supplies section sponsored by <a>Staples</a> with many of the same Staples-branded items found in their regular stores), 23 meeting rooms, eight lounge areas (including one dedicated to the <a>USS <em>Arizona</em></a>), a computer lab, a <a>U.S. Post Office</a>, a copy center named Fast Copy, and a video arcade.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Azstarnet.com</a>&lt;/ref&gt;
The bell is rung seven times on the third Wednesday of every month at 12:07 pm - symbolic of the battleship's sinking on Dec. 7, 1941 - to honor individuals at the UA, as well as after home football games.&lt;ref

<p> &lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: <a>thumb|right|200px|University of Arizona &quot;A&quot; Logo</a> --&gt; Like many large public universities in the U.S., sports are a major activity on campus, and receive a large operating budget.
Arizona's athletic teams are nicknamed the <strong>Wildcats</strong>, a name derived from a 1914 football game with then <a>California</a> champions <a>Occidental College</a>, where the <a>L.A. Times</a> asserted that, &quot;the Arizona men showed the fight of wildcats.&quot;&lt;ref
Another notable former Wildcat basketball player is <a>Eugene Edgerson</a>, who played on the 1997 and 2001 Final Four squads, and is currently one of the primary stars of the <a>Harlem Globetrotters</a> as &quot;Wildkat&quot; Edgerson.</p>
In 1998, the team posted a school-record 12&ndash;1 season and made the <a>Holiday Bowl</a> in which it defeated the <a>Nebraska Cornhuskers</a>.
The program is led by <a>Mike Stoops</a>, brother of <a>Bob Stoops</a>, the head football coach at the <a>University of Oklahoma</a>.</p>
T. Snow</a>, <a>Don Lee</a>, Carl Thomas, <a>Mike Paul</a>, <a>Dan Schneider</a>, <a>Rich Hinton</a>, <a>Ed Vosberg</a>, <a>Hank Leiber</a>, <a>Ron Hassey</a>, <a>Brad Mills</a>, and <a>Joe Magrane</a>.</p>
<p>The Arizona <a>softball</a> team is among the top programs in the country and a perennial powerhouse.
Coach Candrea, along with former Arizona pitcher <a>Jennie Finch</a>, led the 2004 U.S. Olympic softball team to a gold medal in <a>Athens, Greece</a>.
<h3>Men's and women's golf</h3>
<p> The lacrosse team is a club team, not a varsity sport at Arizona, affectionately known as the &#x201c;Laxcats&#x201d;.
Its existence, since the mid-sixties, is saturated with a rich tradition of success.
<p>Many other Wildcats have met with success at the University.
Also, the men ended Texas and Auburn&#x2019;s winning streak since 1998.
The Wildcats won with 484 team points while <a>Auburn University</a> came in second with 348 and <a>Stanford University</a> in third with 343.
Another individual champion occurred in 1989 when Mariusz Podkoscielny <a>swimming</a> won the 1650-yard (mile) at the NCAA National Championships held at the IUPUI Natatorium.</p>
Rivalries have also been created with other <a>Pac-10</a> teams, especially <a>University of California, Los Angeles</a> which has provided a worthy <a>softball</a> rival and was Arizona's main <a>basketball</a> rival in the early and mid-1990s.</p>
Together, Wilbur and Wilma appear along with the <a>cheerleading</a> squad at most Wildcat sporting events.&lt;ref
From his airplane window, Lee observed the huge letters on the roof of the UA gymnasium reading &quot;BEAR DOWN.&quot;
Inspired, Lee scribbled down the music and lyrics to an up-tempo song.

<p>As mentioned earlier, a new and expansive Student Union building,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; opened in 2003; it is the largest student union in the U.S. not affiliated with a hotel.
A listing is found at Center For Student Involvement and Leadership (CSIL)&lt;ref&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; through the Student Union.
<p>The campus comedy group, <a>Comedy Corner</a> is a sketch and improv comedy group at the University of Arizona.
<p>At the beginning of each school year, freshmen repaint the &quot;A&quot; on <a>&quot;A&quot; Mountain</a>, and since 1914 the &quot;A&quot; remains a <a>Tucson</a> and Wildcat landmark.&lt;ref
The event occurs every April, and brings together the U of A community and the Tucson community.
<p>The current school colors are UA red and UA blue, recognized in the <a>Pantone Matching System</a>, with the PMS number 200 and 281, respectively.
Before 1900, the colors were sage green and silver.
Each of the 10 Senators and all Administrative Officers also are appointed to serve on the various University of Arizona Faculty and Administrative Committees.</p>
Each year (usually in late March or early April), the graduate and professional students elect 30 representatives by constituency in accordance to College graduate and/or professional student population, with three of those representatives elected at large.
Anyone who lives on campus is automatically a member of RHA.
Each Hall Council is composed of a President, a Director of Programming (for social events), a Director of Operations (for administrative duties), a Director of Sustainability (for recycling duties), and two RHA Representatives who are sent to represent their hall at RHA General Body Meetings.
At these meetings, the gathered representatives and RHA Executive Board, elected from within the RHA General Body, discuss issues and make decisions concerning all 6,000 on campus residents.
