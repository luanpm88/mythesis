Victoria University is somewhat separated from the rest of the university geographically, bordering <a>Queen's Park</a>, and being located on the eastern portion of the campus along with <a>St.
<p>Traditionally, Victoria has attracted students with high academic reputations, maintaining its long reputation as one of Canada's strongest institutions of higher education.
In part this has been because of alumni donations, but much of the growth is specifically due to the rapidly increasing value of Victoria's large real estate holdings in downtown Toronto.
<p>[[Image:VicU1900.jpg|left|thumb|Old Vic in [[1900]] ]] <a>left|thumb|Old Vic, the original building of Victoria College</a> Victoria College was originally founded as the Upper Canada Academy by the Wesleyan Methodist Church.
In 1831, a committee decided to locate the academy on four acres (1.6 hectares) of land in <a>Cobourg, Ontario</a>, east of <a>Toronto</a>, because of its central location in a large town and access by land and water.
The school officially opened to male and female students on October 12, 1836, with Ryerson as the first president and Matthew Ritchie as principal.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext04/tlctd10.txt</a> The Project Gutenberg EBook #6466 of 'The Intellectual Development of the Canadian People, A historical review' by John George Bourinot, House of Commons, Ottawa, February 17th, 1881 &lt;/ref&gt; Although the school taught a variety of liberal arts subjects, it also functioned as an unofficial <a>Methodist</a> seminary.
In 1841, it was incorporated as Victoria College, named for <a>Queen Victoria</a>, and finally received a charter from the Upper Canadian Legislature.
<p>Victoria University was formed in 1884 when Victoria College and <a>Albert University</a> federated with each other.
In 1890, Victoria University federated with the University of Toronto.
In 1892, Victoria University moved from Cobourg to its current campus on Queen's Park Crescent, south of <a>Bloor Street</a> (at Charles Street West), in Toronto.
<p>A plaque was erected at 100 University Avenue at the intersection with College Street in <a>Cobourg, Ontario</a>.

Construction began in 1911 and was completed in 1913.
The Upper Houses, built in 1913, consist of four houses: North House, Middle House, Gate House, and South House.
The Lower Houses were built in 1931 and were originally intended to house theology students at Emmanuel College, whose current building was opened the same year.

Before Rowell Jackman Hall was built, the site was home to a parking lot and the historic Stephenson House.
The building's construction caused some controversy as it greatly disrupted life in Burwash.
The site of the library and the adjacent Northrop Frye Building was originally on the route of Queen's Park Crescent.

<p>Victoria is presently the wealthiest college at the University of Toronto by net assets.
In part this has been because of alumni donations, but much of the growth is specifically due to the rapidly increasing value of Victoria's large real estate holdings in downtown Toronto.
In particular, it houses the <a>Erasmus</a> collection, one of the richest resources in <a>North America</a> for the study of works written or edited by the great <a>Dutch</a> <a>humanist</a> Desiderius Erasmus of <a>Rotterdam</a>.
Recently, the administration of Victoria University has been actively promoting international experiences as a part of the undergraduate student experience.[<a>http://www.vicu.utoronto.ca/Assets/Alumni/vicreports/Winter+07/President$!27s+Page.pdf?method=1</a>]</p>

REED examines the historical manuscripts that provide external evidence of drama, secular music, and other communal entertainment and ceremony from the Middle Ages until <a>1642</a>, when the <a>Puritans</a> closed the London theatres.
<p>Founded in 1975, REED has for the last 31 years worked to locate, transcribe, and edit all surviving documentary evidence of drama, minstrelsy, and public ceremonial in England before 1642.
As well, two collections go beyond the original boundaries of our research to cover other parts of the British Isles, RED (Records of Early Drama): Scotland and Wales.
Twenty-five collections of records have been completed since the first REED collection, York, appeared in 1979; the most recent one, REED: Lincolnshire, comes out in 2009.
Victoria College has both clubs and levy receivers, which are overseen by the Victoria University Students' Administrative Council (VUSAC)[<a>http://www.vusac.ca/</a>].
Clubs include PlenTea to Talk About, Vic Dance, VicPride, the Scarlet and Gold Martial Arts Society, and the Victoria College Chorus.&lt;ref&gt;[<a>http://clubs.vusac.ca/</a>]&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
Over the past few years the theatre has been used as a lecture hall for University of Toronto students, an active learning space for Victoria University students groups, numerous concerts, theatrical productions, film screenings, and conferences.</p>
Until 2007, when Victoria administration made it co-ed, Gate House was one of the last remaining all-male residence building in the University of Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Gate House, with the rest of Upper Burwash, opened in 1913 and has held students every year since then except 1995, when it was renovated.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
When it was completed Rowell Jackman Hall was mainly home to upper years and graduate students.
Today it only houses underdgrads and has a considerable number of first years, except for the Marchand-Smith wing, or International House, which continues to house a number of upper years.</p>
Gate sat in the southwest corner, Middle sat in the far northeast, South sat in the table to the west of Middle, while North sat to the west of the southeast corner.
(Note that prior to the 1995 renovations, some of these houses, particularly North and Caven, 'traditionally' sat elsewhere)</p>
The Victoria Dean of Students cancelled Novemberfest in 2003, when police discovered widespread underage drinking and over 800 people in the dining hall, in violation of the fire code.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
<p>During its 93 years as a men's residence, Gate House developed a distinct character and reputation.
These antics included pranks, toga parties, streaking, caroling to other residences, hazing rituals, &quot;beer bashes&quot; and &quot;incessant pounding&quot; on the Gate House table in the dining hall.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
<p>The all-male Gate House was known as a social centre and spirited, tight-knit community.
According to Grayson Lee, who created the snow penis sculpture in 2007, most of its residents were &quot;heartbroken&quot; to leave.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
