<p> <strong>Victoria University</strong> is a <a>federated school</a> of the <a>University of Toronto</a>, consisting of Victoria College and <a>Emmanuel College</a>.
<p>Victoria is presently the wealthiest college at U of T by net assets.
<p>In 1928, the independent Union College federated with the theology department of Victoria College, and became <a>Emmanuel College</a>.</p>
<h2>Sites and architecture</h2>
The campus is centred on the main quadrangle of Victoria, outlined by the upper and lower houses of Burwash Hall.</p>
The building is an extravagant <a>Neo-Gothic</a> work with <a>turret</a>s, <a>gargoyle</a>s, and <a>battlement</a>s.
<p>The building is divided between the large dining hall in the northwest and the student residence proper.
West of the Lower Houses is the new Lester B. Pearson Garden of Peace and International Understanding and the E.J. Pratt Library beyond it.
From the eastern side of the building, the Upper Houses look out at Rowell Jackman Hall and the Lower Houses see the <a>St.
It stands just to the east of <a>Burwash Hall</a> on Charles St. and is west of <a>St.
<p><strong>Margaret Addison Hall</strong> is a seven-floor co-ed residence across Charles St. from Burwash Hall, between the Wymilwood building and the Victoria sports field.
<p>Built in 1961 and located at the south end of the quadrangle, the <strong>E.J. Pratt Library</strong> the main library of Victoria University, with some 250,000 volumes.
The collection is geared towards the undergraduates and contains mainly humanities texts with a focus on History, English, and Philosophy.
<h2>Academics and organization </h2>
The Centre for Reformation and Renaissance Studies holdings fall into three main categories: <a>rare books</a>, most of which were printed before 1700 (currently about 4,000 titles), modern books (currently about 25,000 volumes), and microforms (several thousand microfiches and reels).
The library contains primary and secondary materials relating to virtually every aspect of the Renaissance and <a>Reformation</a>.
<p><a>right|thumb|The E.J. Pratt Library</a> The academic programs of the college include Literary Studies, Semiotics and Communication Theory, Renaissance Studies, the Vic Concurrent Teacher Education Program (developed in conjunction with OISE/UT) and the first-year undergraduate programs Vic One and Vic First Pathways.
The centre also offers <a>undergraduate</a>, <a>graduate</a>, and <a>postdoctoral</a> fellowships.

which provides students with a chance to participate and compete in intramural sports.</li>
<h3>Residential halls and houses</h3>
<p>[[File:Annesley Hall.JPG|thumb|[[Annesley Hall]] ]] Each Upper House at Burwash Hall consists of three floors.
The lower floor contains a <a>common room</a> equipped with kitchen facilities, couches and a television.
The upper floors each have their own kitchen and dining area.
Upper Houses are divided between double rooms and singles, with about sixty percent of the population being in doubles.
The rooms in the Lower Houses are also considered more luxurious with <a>hardwood floor</a>s and large sizes.
Before the renovations the entire building was all male, but now every house is co-ed.</p>
<p>Gate House is one of the four Upper Houses of Burwash Hall.
<p>The eight storey Rowell Jackman Hall building is an apartment style residence with each floor divided into a number of suites.
Stephenson House is self-governed and self-regulating with a separate application and selection process.</p>
Under the flag is the <a>high table</a> where the professors and college administration lunch.
<h3>Culture and traditions</h3>
Another Gate House tradition that no longer occurs is the &quot;stirring the chicken,&quot; a dinner and keg party where house members cook chicken fajitas for hundreds of guests.
Until 2007, Gate House held secretive first-year initiation ceremonies called Traditionals, which involved writing slogans on campus buildings in chalk, singing songs to the all-women's residence (who would then sing back to them), and leading first-years around the house blindfolded.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
