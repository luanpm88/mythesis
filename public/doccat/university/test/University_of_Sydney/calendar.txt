The following year seven professorships were created; anatomy, zoology, engineering, history, law, logic &amp; mental philosophy, and modern literature.</p>
The philosophy department split over the issue to become the Traditional and Modern Philosophy Department, headed by Armstrong and following a more <a>traditional approach to philosophy</a>, and the General Philosophy Department, which follows the French <a>continental approach</a>.</p>
In 2005, the Public Service Association of NSW and the <a>Community and Public Sector Union</a> were in dispute with the university over a proposal to privatise security at the main campus (and the Cumberland campus.)&lt;ref&gt;Public

<p>The main campus is spread across two inner-city suburbs of Sydney: Camperdown and Darlington.</p>
The architect <a>Edmund Blacket</a> designed the original <a>Neogothic</a> <a>sandstone</a> Quadrangle and Great Tower buildings, which were completed in 1862.
The Camperdown/Darlington campus houses the university's administrative headquarters, and the Faculties of Arts, Science, Education and Social Work, Pharmacy, Veterinary Science, Economics and Business, Architecture, and Engineering.
<p>The main campus is also the focus of the university's student life, with the student-run <a>University of Sydney Union</a> (known as 'the Union') in possession of three buildings - Wentworth, Manning and Holme Buildings.
These buildings house a large proportion of the university's catering outlets, and provide space for recreational rooms, bars and function centres.
<p>The university is currently undertaking a large capital works program with the aim of revitalising the campus and providing more office, teaching and student space.&lt;ref&gt;<a>&quot;Campus
2010 + Building for the Future&quot;</a>&lt;/ref&gt; The program will see the amalgamation of the smaller science and technical libraries into a larger library, and the construction of a central administration and student services building along City Road.
<li><strong>Camden campus</strong>: Located on Sydney's southwest rural fringe, the <a>Camden</a> campus houses research farms for agriculture and veterinary science.</li>
<li><strong>One Tree Island</strong>: Located on the Great Barrier Reef, about 20&nbsp;km east of Heron Island and about 100&nbsp;km off the Queensland coast, and houses a research station of the School of Biological Sciences.</li>
<li>The Narrabri Plant Research Centre is located at <strong><a>Narrabri</a></strong>, near the Queensland border.</li>
<h2>Facilities and services</h2>
<h3>Museums and galleries</h3>
It is housed in several different places, including the <a>Sir Hermann Black Gallery</a> and the <a>War Memorial Art Gallery</a>.</li>
<li>The <strong>Rare Books Library</strong> is a part of the <a>Fisher Library</a> and holds 185,000 books and manuscripts which are rare, valuable or fragile, including eighty medieval manuscripts, works by Galileo, Halley and Copernicus and an extensive collection of <a>Australiana</a>.
All offer tutorial support and a wide range of social and sporting activities in a supportive communal environment.
Five colleges are affiliated with religious denominations and while this gives each of these colleges a special character, students of any denomination or religion are eligible for admission.
Unlike some residential colleges in British or American universities, the colleges are not affiliated with any specific discipline of study.
They are modelled on the British system of colleges and competition for entry is high each year.
For a variety of important reasons, the intercol network has chosen to have no affiliation with these &quot;houses&quot;.</p>
<p><a>thumb|Orientation week held at the lawn.</a>
<a>thumb|Holme Building is one of the centres for student activities.</a></p>
This involves delivering a huge Clubs and Societies program, a varied entertainment program, student opportunities, a range of catering and retail services plus buildings and recreational spaces for students, staff and visitors.</li>
It currently manages and administers 42 sport and recreation clubs, organises sporting and recreation events, and offers student and non-student members a comprehensive range of sporting facilities.</li>
However, some complaints have been made in the pages of <em>Honi Soit</em> and other publications about the organisations' claims to represent the student body, citing perennially low voter turnouts and the general apathy of much of the university population to student politics.</p>
The legislation prohibited the compulsory collection of fees from students, which had been the customary means of funding student organisations, after the beginning of Semester 2 of 2006.
