<p><strong>The University of Sydney</strong> (informally <strong>Sydney University</strong> or <strong>USyd</strong>) is a university located in <a>Sydney</a>, <a>Australia</a>.
As of 2009, the university had 47,775 students, making it the second largest in Australia.&lt;ref
In addition, the university encompasses a number of small special-purpose satellite campuses obtained from other organisations over the past 20 years, including the <a>Sydney Conservatorium of Music</a> and the <a>Sydney College of the Arts</a>.</p>
<p>The University of Sydney is a member of Australia's <a>Group of Eight</a>, Academic Consortium 21, the <a>Association of Pacific Rim Universities</a> (APRU) and the <a>Worldwide Universities Network</a>.</p>
Wentworth argued that a state university was imperative for the growth of a society aspiring towards self-government, and that it would provide the opportunity for 'the child of every class, to become great and useful in the destinies of his country'.
It would take two attempts on Wentworth's behalf, however, before the plan was finally adopted.</p>
<p>The university was established via the passage of the University of Sydney Act,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; which was signed on 1 October 1850.
Two years later, the University was inaugurated on 11 October 1852 in the Big Schoolroom of what is now <a>Sydney Grammar School</a>.
On 27 February 1858 the university received its <a>Royal Charter</a> from <a>Queen Victoria</a>, giving degrees conferred by the university rank and recognition equal to those given by universities in the UK.&lt;ref name=&quot;royal_charter&quot;&gt;<a>Royal Charter of the University of Sydney</a>&lt;/ref&gt; By 1859, the university had moved to its current site in the Sydney suburb of <a>Camperdown</a>.</p>
<p>In 1858, the passage of the Electoral Act provided for the University to become a constituency for the <a>New South Wales Legislative Assembly</a> as soon as there were 100 graduates with higher degrees.
This seat in Parliament was first filled in 1876, but was abolished in 1880 one year after its second Member, <a>Edmund Barton</a>, was elected to the Legislative Assembly.</p>
<p>Most of the estate of <a>John Henry Challis</a> was bequeathed to the University, which received a sum of &#x00a3;200,000 in 1889.
This was thanks in part due to <a>William Montagu Manning</a> (Chancellor 1878&#x2013;1895) who argued against the claims by British Tax Commissioners.
<p>The New England University College was founded as part of the University of Sydney in 1938, and separated to become the University of New England in 1954.</p>

<p>During the late 1960s, the University of Sydney was at the centre of rows to introduce courses on <a>Marxism</a> and <a>feminism</a> at the major Australian universities.
At one stage, newspaper reporters descended on the university to cover brawls, demonstrations, secret memos and a walk-out by Professor <a>David Armstrong</a>, a respected philosopher who held the Challis Chair of Philosophy from 1959 to 1991, after students at one of his lectures openly demanded a course on feminism.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

<p><a>thumb|250px|Front lawns</a> The <a>Orange Agricultural College</a> (OAC) was originally transferred to the <a>University of New England</a> under the Act, but then transferred to the University of Sydney in 1994, as part of the reforms to the University of New England undertaken by the University of New England Act 1993&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and the Southern Cross University Act 1993.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
In January 2005, the University of Sydney transferred the OAC to <a>Charles Sturt University</a>.</p>
<p>In 2001, University of Sydney Chancellor <a>Dame Leonie Kramer</a> was forced to resign by the university's governing body.&lt;ref&gt;<em><a>Australian
In 2003, <a>Nick Greiner</a>, a former <a>premier of New South Wales</a>, resigned from his position as chair of the university's Graduate School of Management because of academic protests against his simultaneous chairmanship of <a>British American Tobacco</a> (Australia).
Subsequently, his wife, <a>Kathryn Greiner</a>, resigned in protest from the two positions she held at the university as chair of the Sydney Peace Foundation and a member of the executive council of the Research Institute for Asia and the Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;<em><a>Sydney

As a Roman Catholic institution, in handing over the land St John's placed limitations on the type of medical research that could be conducted on the premises, seeking to preserve the essence of the College mission.
<p>At the start of 2010, the University controversially adopted a new logo.
There have been stylistic changes, the main one being the coat of arm's <a>mantling</a>, the shape of the <a>escutcheon</a> (shield), the removal of the motto scroll, and also others more subtle within the Arms itself such as the mane and fur of the lion, the number of lines in the open book, and the colouration.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
<p>In 2010, the <a>Times Higher Education World University Rankings</a> placed the University of Sydney 184st in the world and 3rd in Australia behind the <a>University of Melbourne</a> (36th) and the Macquarie University (43rd).&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p><a>QS World University Rankings</a> 2010 placed the University of Sydney 48th in the world and 2nd in Australia ahead of the University of Melbourne (38th).&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
<p>On the <a>Academic Ranking of World Universities</a> rankings in 2010, University of Sydney is placed 92nd in the world and 9th in the <a>Asia Pacific</a> and 3rd in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.arwu.org/ARWU2010.jsp</a>&lt;/ref&gt;
<p>According to Reuters' recent research publication, University of Sydney was the biggest non-government research institute in the Australia-New Zealand (Oceania) region.
Apart from that, outside the Australian government's research arm, the university has consistently been the largest recipient of research grants in the country over the last 10 years, particularly in medicine.</p>
<p> Throughout its history, University of Sydney alumni have made significant contributions to <a>Australia</a> and beyond.
Australian leaders who have graduated from the university include two <a>governors-general</a>, five <a>Australian prime ministers</a>, four <a>chief justices</a> of the <a>High Court of Australia</a>, and twenty other <a>justices of the High Court</a>, as well as the third president of the <a>United Nations General Assembly</a> and three <a>Nobel laureates</a>.</p>

A drop due to recent downturn of the global economic situation.
<p>Latest figures show that the University of Sydney has received the highest amount of research grants, which may demonstrate its research competitiveness and the size of its students and staff body.&lt;ref
name=&quot;usyd_facts&quot;/&gt; The University of Sydney also has the second largest (behind <a>Monash University</a>) body of students and researchers among Australian universities.</p>
<p>The University of Sydney secured more than $46 million in funding in the 2007 round of National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Project Grant, Capacity Building and Fellowship awards, the largest allocation to any university in the state.
The award includes various grant and research opportunities that may be taken up by both staff members and senior students.
Five of the university's affiliated medical research facilities secured $38 million in the Australian government's 2006 budget, part of $163 million made available for a variety of development and expansion projects.</p>
A new building for the School of Information Technologies opened in late 2006, and has been located on a site adjacent to the Seymour Centre.
<p>From 2007, the university will also use space in the former <a>Eveleigh</a> railway yards, just to the south of <a>Darlington</a>, for examination purposes.</p>
<p>The campus is well served by public transport, being a short walk from <a>Redfern Railway Station</a> and served by buses on the neighbouring <a>Parramatta Road</a> and <a>City Road</a>.&lt;ref&gt;University of Sydney, Faculty of Education &amp; Social Work, <a>&quot;About Sydney&quot;</a>.
