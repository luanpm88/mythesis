<p>Founded in 1746 in <a>Elizabeth, New Jersey</a>, as the College of New Jersey, the university moved to Newark in 1747, then to Princeton in 1756 and was renamed Princeton University in 1896.
Massey Rhind]] (1892), Alexander Hall, Princeton University]] <a>New Light</a> <a>Presbyterians</a> founded the College of New Jersey, later Princeton University, in 1746 in order to train ministers dedicated to their views.
In another disaster, fire destroyed Nassau Hall in March 1802.
Student unrest led to an explosion at the Nassau Hall front door and several other accidents in 1810.
<p>Before the construction of Stanhope Hall in 1803, the college's sole building was <a>Nassau Hall</a>.
The college also adopted orange as its school color from William III.
The much-abused landmark survived bombardment with <a>cannonball</a>s in the <a>American Revolutionary War</a> when General Washington struggled to wrest the building from British control, as well as later fires in 1802 and 1855 that left only its walls standing.
Over the centuries, its role shifted from an all-purpose building, comprising office, dormitory, library, and classroom space, to classroom space exclusively, to its present role as the administrative center of the university.
Originally, the sculptures in front of the building were lions, as a gift in 1879.
These were later replaced with tigers in 1911.</p>
<p><a>James McCosh</a> took office as the college's president in 1868 and lifted the institution out of a low period that had been brought about by the Civil War.
<p>In 1896, the college officially changed its name from the College of New Jersey to Princeton University to honor the town in which it resides.
During this year, the college also underwent large expansion and officially became a university.
<p>In 1969, Princeton University first admitted women as undergraduates.
After abortive discussions with <a>Sarah Lawrence College</a> to relocate the women's college to Princeton and merge it with the University in 1967, the administration decided to admit women and turned to the issue of transforming the school's operations and facilities into a female-friendly campus.
The administration had barely finished these plans in April 1969 when the admissions office began mailing out its acceptance letters.
(Princeton enrolled its first female graduate student, Sabra Follett Meserve, as a Ph.D. candidate in Turkish history in 1961.
A handful of undergraduate women had studied at Princeton from 1963 on, spending their junior year there to study &quot;critical languages&quot; in which Princeton's offerings surpassed those of their home institutions.
Stanhope Hall (once a library, now home of the University's Center for African-American Studies) and East and West College, both dormitories, followed.
Major buildings in the late 19th Century were built in brownish stone in a Victorian Gothic style influenced by the Richardsonian Romanesque, many designed by William Appleton Potter, including the Chancellor Green Library and Alexander Hall.
<p>Beginning at the very end of the 19th century, the University adopted a consistent <a>Collegiate Gothic</a> style, executed in gray stone.
This standard continued up to World War II, and includes most buildings in the northern third of campus except the 19th-century core.
A second &quot;Little Cannon&quot; is buried in the lawn in front of nearby <a>Whig Hall</a>.
Ownership of the cannon was disputed and the cannon was eventually taken back to Princeton partly by a military company and then by a hundred Princeton students.
The &quot;Big Cannon&quot; was eventually buried in its current location behind Nassau Hall in 1840.
Built in 1754, it was the first seat of the <a>New Jersey Legislature</a> in 1776, was involved in the battle of Princeton in 1777, and was the seat of the <a>Congress of the Confederation</a> (successor to the <a>Continental Congress</a>) from 30 June 1783 to 4 November 1783.
Two colleges, <a>Wilson College</a> and <a>Forbes College</a> (formerly Princeton Inn College), date to the 1970s; three others, Rockefeller, Mathey, and Butler Colleges, were created in 1983 following the Committee on Undergraduate Residential Life (CURL) report, which suggested the institution of residential colleges as a solution to an allegedly fragmented campus social life.
The construction of Whitman College, the university's sixth residential college, was completed in 2007.</p>
<p>Wilson College and <a>Butler College</a>, located south of the center of the campus, were built in the 1960s.
Wilson served as an early experiment in the establishment of the residential college system.
The Princeton Inn, originally constructed in 1924, played regular host to important symposia and gatherings of renowned scholars from both the university and the nearby Institute for Advanced Studies for many years.
<p>The precursor of the present college system in America was originally proposed by university president Woodrow Wilson in the early 20th century.
For over 800 years, however, the collegiate system had already existed in Britain at Oxford University and Cambridge University.
Today, the Triangle Club performs its annual freshmen revue and spring musicals in McCarter.
McCarter is also recognized as one of the leading regional theaters in the <a>United States</a>.</p>

<h4>University Chapel</h4>
Construction on the Princeton University Chapel began in 1924 and was completed in 1927 at a cost of $2.4 million.
It was designed by the University's lead consulting architect, Ralph Adams Cram, previously of Boston's architectural firm Cram, Goodhue, and Ferguson, leading proponents of the Gothic revival style.
<p>Published in 2008, Princeton's Sustainability Plan highlights three priority areas for the University's Office of Sustainability: reduction of greenhouse gas emissions; conservation of resources; and research, education, and civic engagement.

The argument posed by Dean Malkiel was that an A was beginning to lose its meaning as a larger percentage of the student body received them.
It is expected to remain in place even after Malkiel steps down at the end of the 2010-2011 school year.</p>
Juniors and seniors also have the option of living off-campus, but high rent in the Princeton area encourages almost all students to live in university housing.
