<p> <strong>Princeton University </strong> is a <a>private</a> <a>research university</a> located in <a>Princeton</a>, <a>New Jersey</a>, <a>United States</a>.
<p>Princeton provides undergraduate and graduate instruction in the <a>humanities</a>, <a>social sciences</a>, <a>natural science</a>s, and <a>engineering</a>.
Princeton does not offer <a>professional school</a>ing generally, but it does offer professional master's degrees (mostly through the <a>Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs</a>) and <a>doctoral</a> programs.</p>
<p>Princeton was the <a>fourth</a> institution of <a>higher education</a> in the U.S. to conduct classes.
While it once had close ties to <a>the Presbyterian Church</a>, it makes no <a>spiritual</a> demands of its students.
The university has ties with the <a>Institute for Advanced Study</a>, <a>Princeton Theological Seminary</a>, and the <a>Westminster Choir College</a> of <a>Rider University</a>.</p>
Witherspoon was a prominent religious and political leader; and an original signer of the <a>Declaration of independence</a> and the <a>Articles of Confederation</a>.
During the summer of 1783, the <a>Continental Congress</a> met in Nassau Hall, making Princeton the country's capital for four months.
Rebuilt by <a>Joseph Henry Latrobe</a>, <a>John Notman</a> and <a>John Witherspoon</a>, the modern Nassau Hall has been much revised and expanded from the original one that was designed by <a>Robert Smith</a>.
Under <a>Woodrow Wilson</a>, Princeton introduced the preceptorial system in 1905, a then-unique concept that augmented the standard lecture method of teaching with a more personal form in which small groups of students, or precepts, could interact with a single instructor, or preceptor, in their field of interest.</p>
In 1887, the university had actually maintained and staffed a <a>sister college</a>, <a>Evelyn College for Women</a>, in the town of Princeton on Evelyn and Nassau streets.
They were considered regular students for their year on campus, but were not candidates for a Princeton degree.)</p>
<p>As a result of a 1979 lawsuit by <a>Sally Frank</a>, <a>Princeton's eating clubs</a> were required to go coeducational in 1991, after <a>Tiger Inn</a>'s appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court was denied.</p>
<p><a>thumb|200px|Many campus buildings have Neo-gothic archways and lanterns.
The main campus is located within the boundaries of three municipalities: <a>Borough of Princeton</a>, <a>Princeton Township</a>, and <a>West Windsor Township</a>.
Designed originally by <a>Robert Smith</a>, the building was subsequently remodeled by notable American architects <a>Benjamin Latrobe</a> and <a>John Notman</a>.
The renowned Philadelphia firm <a>Cope &amp; Stewardson</a> designed Blair Hall and Little Hall in the <a>Collegiate Gothic</a> style.
<a>McKim, Mead &amp; White</a> designed the FitzRandolph Gateway in front of Nassau Hall.
Contemporary additions feature a number of big-name architects, including <a>IM Pei</a>'s Spelman Halls, <a>Robert Venturi</a>'s <a>Frist Campus Center</a>, <a>Rafael Vinoly</a>'s <a>Carl Icahn</a> Laboratory, the Hillier Group's Bowen Hall, and <a>Demetri Porphyrios</a>' <a>Whitman College</a>.
<p>A variety of <a>sculptures</a> adorn the campus.
They include pieces by <a>Henry Moore</a> (<em>Oval with Points</em>, also nicknamed &quot;<a>Nixon</a>'s Nose&quot;), <a>Clement Meadmore</a> (<em>Upstart II</em>), and <a>Alexander Calder</a> (<em>Five Disks: One Empty</em>).
<p>At the southern edge of the campus is <a>Lake Carnegie</a>, a man-made lake donated by the steel magnate <a>Andrew Carnegie</a> and used for <a>crew</a> (rowing).
<p>Princeton has six undergraduate <a>residential college</a>s, each housing approximately 500 freshmen, sophomores, some juniors and seniors, and a handful of junior and senior <a>resident advisers</a>.
Each college consists of a set of dormitories, a dining hall, a variety of other amenities&mdash;such as study spaces, libraries, performance spaces, and darkrooms&mdash;and a collection of administrators and associated faculty.
<li><a>Butler College</a></li>
<li><a>Forbes College</a></li>
<li><a>Mathey College</a></li>
<li><a>Rockefeller College</a></li>
<li><a>Whitman College</a></li>
<li><a>Wilson College</a></li>
<p><a>Rockefeller College</a> and <a>Mathey College</a> are located in the northwest corner of the campus; Princeton brochures often feature their Collegiate Gothic architecture.
Butler, like Rockefeller and Mathey, consisted of a collection of ordinary dorms (called the &quot;New New Quad&quot;) before the addition of a dining hall made it a residential college.
Butler and most of Forbes are in a different <a>municipality</a>, Princeton Township, from the rest of the main campus, which is in <a>Princeton Borough</a>.</p>
<p>In 2003, Princeton broke ground for a sixth college that is named <a>Whitman College</a> after its principal sponsor, <a>Meg Whitman</a>, the former <a>CEO</a> of <a>eBay</a> and a member of the Princeton Class of 1977.
The new dormitories were constructed in the <a>Collegiate Gothic</a> architectural style and were designed by architect <a>Demetri Porphyrios</a>.
<a>McCarter Theatre</a> was built by the <a>Princeton Triangle Club</a>, a student performance group, using club profits and a gift from Princeton University alumnus Thomas McCarter.
This continues to be a primary function, along with serving as a community resource and a destination for national and international visitors.</p>
<p>Numbering over 72,000 objects, the collections range from ancient to contemporary art and concentrate geographically on the <a>Mediterranean</a> regions, <a>Western Europe</a>, <a>China</a>, the United States, and <a>Latin America</a>.
There is a collection of <a>Greek</a> and <a>Roman</a> <a>antiquities</a>, including <a>ceramics</a>, marbles, bronzes, and Roman mosaics from faculty excavations in <a>Antioch</a>.
Other works include those of the John B. Putnam, Jr., Memorial Collection of twentieth-century sculpture, featuring such modern masters as <a>Alexander Calder</a>, <a>Jacques Lipchitz</a>, Henry Moore and <a>Pablo Picasso</a>.
<p> <a>thumb|200px|right|Princeton University Chapel</a> <a>Princeton University Chapel</a> is the third-largest college chapel in the world, behind those of <a>Valparaiso University</a> and <a>King's College, Cambridge</a>, <a>England</a>.
Known for its <a>gothic architecture</a>, the chapel houses one of the largest and most precious stained glass collections in the country.
Both the Opening Exercises for entering freshmen and the Baccalaureate Service for graduating seniors take place in the University Chapel.
The vaulting was built by the Guastavino Company, whose thin Spanish tile vaults can be found in <a>Ellis Island</a>, <a>Grand Central Terminal</a>, and hundreds of other significant works of 20th century architecture.</p>
<p>The -long, -high, <a>cruciform</a> church has a <a>collegiate Gothic</a> style and it is made largely from <a>Pennsylvania</a> <a>sandstone</a> and <a>Indiana</a> <a>limestone</a>.
It seats two thousand people, many in pews made from wood salvaged from <a>Civil War</a>-era gun carriages.
<p>Nearby music conservatory <a>Westminster Choir College</a> (a part of <a>Rider University</a>) frequently uses the University Chapel space.
Each winter term, the Choir College performs an Evening of Readings and Carols; each May, the school uses the chapel for a <a>commencement</a> ceremony for the Choir College with musical performances from many of Westminster's ensembles.</p>
Some of Princeton's wealth is invested in its art museum, which features works by <a>Claude Monet</a>,  <a>Vincent van Gogh</a>,  <a>Jackson Pollock</a>, and <a>Andy Warhol</a> among other prominent artists.</p>
<p><a>thumb|200px|The courtyard of East Pyne</a> Undergraduates fulfill general education requirements, choose among a wide variety of elective courses, and pursue departmental concentrations and interdisciplinary certificate programs.
Students graduate with either the <a>Bachelor of Arts</a> (A.B.) or the <a>Bachelor of Science</a> in engineering (B.S.E.).</p>
<p>The <a>Graduate School</a> offers advanced degrees spanning the <a>humanities</a>, <a>social sciences</a>, <a>natural sciences</a>, and <a>engineering</a>.
It emphasizes original and independent scholarship whereas master's degree programs in <a>architecture</a>, <a>engineering</a>, <a>finance</a>, and public affairs and public policy prepare candidates for careers in public life and professional practice.</p>
A.B. candidates must also fulfill a three or four semester foreign language requirement and distribution requirements with a total of 31 classes.
candidates follow a parallel track with an emphasis on a rigorous science and math curriculum, a computer science requirement, and at least two semesters of independent research including an optional senior thesis.
Nonetheless, in the spirit of a <a>liberal arts</a> education, both enjoy a comparatively high degree of latitude in creating a self-structured curriculum.</p>
Although Princeton offers professional graduate degrees in <a>engineering</a>, <a>architecture</a>, and <a>finance</a>, it has no <a>medical school</a>, <a>law school</a>, or <a>business school</a> like other research universities.
Its collections include the <a>Blickling homilies</a>.
Seniors in some departments can register for enclosed carrels in the main library for workspace and the private storage of books and research materials.
In September 2006, the university announced that all applicants for the Class of 2012 would be considered in a single pool.
In this way, the <a>Early Decision</a> program was effectively ended.
In 2001, expanding on earlier reforms, Princeton was the first university to eliminate <a>loans</a> for all students who qualify for <a>aid</a>.
It has been ranked eighth among world universities by <a>Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a>, and fifth among top 50 for Natural Sciences by THES.
Its three highest subject rankings were: 6th in Arts &amp; Humanities, 7th in <a>Natural Sciences</a>, and 10th in <a>Social Sciences</a>.
<a>thumb|left|200px|Clio Hall</a> </p>
The <a>behavioral neuroscience</a> program has been ranked sixth and the <a>social psychology</a> program has been ranked seventh.
<p>Princeton University has an IBM <a>BlueGeneL</a> supercomputer, called <em>Orangena</em>, which was ranked as the 89th fastest computer in the world in 2005 (<a>LINPACK</a> performance of 4713 compared to 12250 for other U. S. universities and 280600 for the top-ranked supercomputer, belonging to the <a>U.
S. Department of Energy</a>).</p>
Freshmen and sophomores must live in <a>residential college</a>s, while juniors and seniors typically live in designated upperclassman dormitories.
Nonetheless, any undergraduate may purchase a meal plan and eat in a residential college dining hall.
Recently, upperclassmen have been given the option of remaining in their college for all four years.
Undergraduate social life revolves around the residential colleges and a number of coeducational <a>eating clubs</a>, which students may choose to join in the spring of their sophomore year.
<p>Princeton's six residential colleges host a variety of social events and activities, guest speakers including visiting professors and other prominent people like <a>Edward Norton</a>, who showed a special sneak preview of <em><a>Fight Club</a></em>, and trips.
Additionally, the clubs serve as evening and weekend social venues for members and guests.</p>
<p>Princeton hosts two <a>Model United Nations</a> conferences, PMUNC in the fall for high school students and PICSim in the spring for college students.
<li><em>Arch Sings</em> - Late-night concerts that feature one or several of Princeton's thirteen undergraduate <em><a>a cappella</a></em> groups.
It is held only if Princeton beats both <a>Harvard University</a> and <a>Yale University</a> at <a>football</a> in the same season.
<li><em><a>Bicker</a></em> - Selection process for new-members that is employed by selective eating clubs.
The event centers on cane wrestling, where a freshman and a sophomore will grapple for control of a cane.
<li><em><a>Newman's Day</a></em> - Students attempt to drink 24 beers in the 24 hours of April 24.
According to the <em><a>New York Times</a></em>, &quot;the day got its name from an apocryphal quote attributed to <a>Paul Newman</a>: '24 beers in a case, 24 hours in a day.
They process through campus by class year during <a>Reunions</a>.</li>
<li><em><a>Reunions</a></em> - Massive annual gathering of alumni held the weekend before graduation.</li>
Although mentioned in <a>Rebecca Goldstein</a>'s 1980s <em>The Mind-Body Problem</em>, a book about Princeton graduate student life (Penguin, reissued 1993), the legend self-deconstructed in the 1990s when the Phantom turned out to be <a>John Forbes Nash</a>, the inventor of the <a>Nash equilibrium</a>.</li>
Most recently, Princeton was ranked as a top 10 school for athletics by </strong></em><a>Sports Illustrated</a><em>. Princeton won a record 21 conference titles from 2000&#x2013;2001.
<p>Princeton's men's and women's squash teams have earned a strong reputation during the past decade.
The team has won thirteen <a>Ivy League</a> titles (1992, 1993, 1995&#x2013;2004, 2006) and six <a>national titles</a> (1992, 1994, 1996&#x2013;1998, 2001).
Between 2000 and 2010, Princeton varsity crews (both men's and women's) won a total of 14 <a>Eastern Sprints</a>, <a>IRA</a> (national), and <a>NCAA</a> championships, as well as two international events at <a>Henley Royal Regatta</a>.</p>
<p>Princeton's <a>basketball</a> team's most notable upset was the 1996 defeat of defending NCAA champion <a>UCLA</a> in the tournament's opening round, Pete Carril's final collegiate victory.
<p>From 1992&#x2013;2001, a nine year span, Princeton's men's basketball team entered the NCAA tournament four times.
Princeton tied the record for fewest points in a Division I game since the 3-point line started in 1986&#x2013;87 when they scored 21 points in a loss against <a>Monmouth University</a> on December 14, 2005.</p>
<p>Princeton also boasts a strong women's soccer program.
<p><a>Princeton Rugby</a> also has a strong presence on campus with over 40 members.
Another similar game took place between <a>Rutgers</a> and <a>Columbia University</a> in 1870 and a third notable game took place between <a>Tufts University</a> and <a>Harvard University</a> in 1875.
<p>Though Princeton is no longer a part of <a>Division I</a> <a>Football Bowl Subdivision</a>, the Tigers have the most overall national championships of any team in major college football history with 24 consensus and non-consensus national championships dating all the way back to their first one, shared with Rutgers, in 1869.</p>
<p>Since 1901, however, they have 4 consensus national championships, which ranks as tied for 11th all time.</p>
<p>Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as <a>commencement</a>, <a>convocation</a>, and athletic games is Princeton Cannon Song, the Princeton University <a>fight song</a>.</p>
<p>&quot;<a>Old Nassau</a>&quot; has been Princeton University's anthem since 1859.
It can also refer to Nassau Hall, the building that was built in 1756 and named after <a>William III</a> of the <a>House of Orange-Nassau</a>.
By <a>metonymy</a>, the term can refer to the university as a whole.
<a>James Madison</a> and <a>Woodrow Wilson</a> graduated from Princeton, <a>Grover Cleveland</a> was not an alumnus but served as a <a>trustee</a>, Chief Justice <a>Oliver Ellsworth</a>; for several years while he spent his retirement in the town of Princeton, and <a>John F. Kennedy</a> spent his freshman fall at the university before leaving due to illness and later transferring to <a>Harvard College</a>.
Current Supreme Court Justices <a>Elena Kagan</a>, <a>Sonia Sotomayor</a> and <a>Samuel Alito</a> are also alumni.</p>
<p>The asteroid <a>508 Princetonia</a> is named for Princeton University by <a>R.
S. Dugan</a>, which he found during his time at <a>K&#x00f6;nigstuhl Observatory</a> with <a>Max Wolf</a> in Heidelberg, Germany.
