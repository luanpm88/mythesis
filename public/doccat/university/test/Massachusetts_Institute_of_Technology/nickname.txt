<p>[[Image:MIT Media Lab.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[MIT Media Lab]] houses researchers developing novel uses of computer technology.
The <a>Union of Concerned Scientists</a> was founded on March 4, 1969 during a meeting of faculty members and students seeking to shift the emphasis on military research towards environmental and social problems.

The Cambridge neighborhoods surrounding MIT are a mixture of high tech companies occupying both modern office and rehabilitated industrial buildings as well as socio-economically diverse residential neighborhoods.
The prominence of the reactor's containment building in a densely populated area has been controversial, but MIT maintains that it is well-secured.

The first buildings constructed on the Cambridge campus, completed in 1916, are known officially as the <em>Maclaurin buildings</em> after Institute president <a>Richard Maclaurin</a> who oversaw their construction.
The friezes of the limestone-clad buildings around Killian Court are engraved with the names of important scientists and philosophers.
The imposing Building 7 atrium along <a>Massachusetts Avenue</a> is regarded as the entrance to the <a>Infinite Corridor</a> and the rest of the campus.</p>
These buildings have not always been popularly accepted; in 2010, <em><a>The Princeton Review</a></em> included MIT in a list of twenty schools whose campuses are &quot;tiny, unsightly, or both.&quot;</p>
<p> [[Image:Simmons Hall, MIT, Cambridge, Massachusetts.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[List of MIT undergraduate dormitories#Simmons Hall|Simmons Hall]] was completed in 2002]] Undergraduates are guaranteed four-year housing in one of MIT's <a>twelve dormitories</a>, although 8% of students live off campus or commute.
Students are permitted to select their dorm and floor upon arrival on campus, and as a result diverse communities arise in living groups; the dorms on and east of Massachusetts Avenue have typically been more involved in <a>countercultural</a> activities.
The current board consists of 43 members elected to five year terms, 25 life members who vote until their 75th birthday, three elected officers (President, Treasurer, and Secretary), and four <em><a>ex officio</a></em> members including the president of the alumni association, the <a>Governor of Massachusetts</a>, the Massachusetts Secretary of Education, and the Chief Justice of the <a>Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court</a>.
<p>MIT's extensive collaboration with the federal government on research projects has also led to several MIT leaders serving as <a>Presidential scientific advisers</a> since 1940.
<p>The mass-market magazine <em><a>Technology Review</a></em> is published by MIT through a subsidiary company, as is a special edition that also serves as the Institute's official alumni magazine.
<p>The School of Engineering has been ranked first among graduate and undergraduate programs by <em><a>U.S. News &amp; World Report</a></em> since first published results in 1994.
The largest undergraduate degree programs are in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (Course VI-2), Mechanical Engineering (Course II), Computer Science and Engineering (Course VI-3), Physics (Course VIII), Biology (Course VII), and Mathematics (Course XVIII).
The humanities, arts, and social sciences (HASS) requirement, consisting of eight semesters, includes a distribution of three classes across each of the humanities, arts, and social sciences as well as a concentration.
The communication requirement consists of two communication-intensive HASS classes and two classes in their major program.

<p>The <a>Independent Activities Period</a> is a four-week long &quot;term&quot; offering hundreds of optional classes, lectures, demonstrations, and other activities throughout the month of January between the Fall and Spring semesters.
Many MIT students also engage in &quot;hacking,&quot; which encompasses both the <a>physical exploration of areas</a> that are generally off-limits (such as rooftops and steam tunnels), as well as <a>elaborate practical jokes</a>.
<p>The Institute's sports teams are called the <strong>Engineers</strong>, their <a>mascot</a> since 1914 being a <a>beaver</a>, &quot;nature's engineer.&quot;
Undergraduate and graduate students are drawn from all 50 states as well as 118 foreign countries.</p>
The <a>interquartile range</a> on the SAT was 2030&#x2013;2320 and 95% of students ranked in the top tenth of their high school graduating class.</p>
The other privately owned Land Grant institution is <a>Cornell University</a>.
The Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology (HST) offers joint MD, MD-PhD, or Medical Engineering degrees in collaboration with <a>Harvard Medical School</a>.
Course numbers are traditionally presented in Roman numerals, e.g.
MIT's Building 7 and Harvard's Johnston Gate, the traditional entrances to each school, are  apart along <a>Massachusetts Avenue</a>.
