<p>    The <strong>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</strong> (<strong>MIT</strong>) is a private research institute located in <a>Cambridge</a>, <a>Massachusetts</a>. MIT has five schools and one college, containing a total of 32 academic departments, with a strong emphasis on scientific and technological research.</p>
In the past 60 years, MIT's educational disciplines have expanded beyond the <a>physical science</a>s and <a>engineering</a> into fields like <a>biology</a>, <a>economics</a>, <a>linguistics</a>, <a>political science</a>, and <a>management</a>.</p>
<p>MIT enrolled 4,232 undergraduates and 6,152 graduate students for 2009&#x2013;2010.
76 <a>Nobel Laureates</a>, 50 <a>National Medal of Science</a> recipients, and 35 <a>MacArthur Fellow</a>s are currently or have previously been affiliated with the university.
In 1861, The Commonwealth of Massachusetts approved a charter for the incorporation of the &quot;Massachusetts Institute of Technology and <a>Boston Society of Natural History</a>&quot; submitted by <a>William Barton Rogers</a>.

<p>Because open conflict in the <a>Civil War</a> broke out only weeks after receiving the charter, MIT's first classes were held in rented space at the Mercantile Building in downtown <a>Boston</a> in 1865.
Over the next 40 years, the MIT faculty and alumni repeatedly rejected overtures from <a>Harvard University</a> president <a>Charles W. Eliot</a> to merge MIT with Harvard's <a>Lawrence Scientific School</a>.</p>

In 1916, MIT moved into the handsome new <a>neoclassical campus</a> designed by <a>William W. Bosworth</a>.</p>
<p>In the 1930s President <a>Karl Taylor Compton</a> and Vice-President (effectively <a>Provost</a>) <a>Vannevar Bush</a> drastically reformed the applied technology curriculum by re-emphasizing the importance of &quot;pure&quot; sciences like physics and chemistry and reducing the work required in shops and drafting.
MIT's <a>Radiation Laboratory</a> was established in 1940 to assist the <a>British</a> in developing a <a>microwave</a> <a>radar</a> and the first mass-produced units were installed on front-line units within months.
Other defense projects included <a>gyroscope</a>-based and other complex <a>control system</a>s for <a>gun</a> and <a>bombsight</a>s and <a>inertial navigation</a> under <a>Charles Stark Draper</a>'s <a>Instrumentation Laboratory</a>, the development of a <a>digital computer</a> for flight simulations under <a>Project Whirlwind</a>, and <a>high-speed</a> and <a>high-altitude</a> photography under <a>Harold Edgerton</a>.
<p>In the post-war years, <a>government-sponsored research</a> such as <a>SAGE</a> and guidance systems for <a>ballistic missile</a>s and <a>Project Apollo</a> combined with surging student enrollments under the <a>G.I.
As the <a>Cold War</a> and <a>Space Race</a> intensified and concerns about the <a>technology gap</a> between the U.S. and the Soviet Union grew more pervasive throughout the 1950s and 1960s, MIT's involvement in the <a>military-industrial complex</a> was a source of pride on campus.</p>
[[Image:MIT McDermott Court.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[I.M. Pei]] designed several buildings bordering on McDermott Court]] Following a comprehensive review of the undergraduate curriculum in 1949 and the successive appointments of more <a>humanistically oriented</a> Presidents <a>Howard W. Johnson</a> and <a>Jerome Wiesner</a> between 1966 and 1980, MIT greatly expanded its programs in the humanities, arts, and social sciences.
Previously marginalized faculties in the areas of economics, management, political science, and linguistics emerged into cohesive and assertive departments by attracting respected professors, launching competitive graduate programs, and forming into the <a>School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences</a> and <a>Sloan School of Management</a> in 1950 to compete with the powerful Schools of <a>Science</a> and <a>Engineering</a>.</p>
<p>In late 1960s and early 1970s, student and faculty activists protested against the <a>Vietnam War</a> and MIT's <a>defense research</a>.
<p>In addition to developing the predecessors to modern computing and <a>networking</a> technologies, students, staff, and faculty members at the <a>Project MAC</a>, <a>Artificial Intelligence Laboratory</a>, and <a>Tech Model Railroad Club</a> wrote some of the earliest interactive <a>computer game</a>s like <em><a>Spacewar!</a></em> and created much of modern <a>hacker</a> <a>slang</a>.
Several major computer-related organizations have originated at MIT since the 1980s; <a>Richard Stallman</a>'s <a>GNU Project</a> and the subsequent <a>Free Software Foundation</a> were founded in the mid-1980s at the AI Lab, the <a>MIT Media Lab</a> was founded in 1985 by <a>Nicholas Negroponte</a> and Jerome Wiesner to promote research into novel uses of computer technology, the <a>World Wide Web Consortium</a> <a>standards organization</a> was founded at the <a>Laboratory for Computer Science</a> in 1994 by <a>Tim Berners-Lee</a>, the <a>OpenCourseWare</a> project has made course materials for over 1,800 MIT classes available online free of charge since 2002, and the <a>One Laptop per Child</a> initiative to expand computer education and connectivity to children worldwide was launched in 2005.
Despite diminishing government financial support over the past quarter century, MIT launched several development campaigns to significantly expand the campus: new dormitories and athletics buildings on west campus, the <a>Tang Center for Management Education</a>, several buildings in the northeast corner of campus supporting research into <a>biology</a>, <a>brain and cognitive sciences</a>, <a>genomics</a>, <a>biotechnology</a>, and <a>cancer research</a>, and a number of new &quot;backlot&quot; buildings on Vassar Street including the <a>Stata Center</a>.
<p>MIT's  campus spans approximately a mile of the north side of the <a>Charles River</a> basin in the city of <a>Cambridge</a>.
The bridge closest to MIT is the <a>Harvard Bridge</a>, which is known for being marked off in a non-standard unit of length &ndash; the <a>smoot</a>.
The <a>Kendall</a> <a>MBTA Red Line</a> station is located on the far northeastern edge of the campus in <a>Kendall Square</a>.
<p><a>MIT's on-campus nuclear reactor</a> is one of the largest university-based <a>nuclear reactor</a>s in the United States.
Other notable campus facilities include a pressurized <a>wind tunnel</a> and a <a>towing tank</a> for testing ship and ocean structure designs.
<p>In 2001, the <a>Environmental Protection Agency</a> sued MIT for violating <a>Clean Water Act</a> and <a>Clean Air Act</a> with regard to its <a>hazardous waste</a> storage and disposal procedures.
MIT settled the suit by paying a $155,000 fine and launching three environmental projects.
MIT has also taken steps to reduce its environmental impact by running alternative fuel campus shuttles, subsidizing <a>public transportation passes</a>, and a low-emission <a>cogeneration</a> plant that serves most of the campus electricity and heating requirements.</p>
[[Stata Center]] houses <a>CSAIL</a>, <a>LIDS</a>, and the Department of Linguistics and Philosophy]] <a>MIT's School of Architecture</a> was the first in the United States, and it has a history of commissioning progressive buildings.
Designed by <a>William Welles Bosworth</a>, these imposing buildings were built of concrete, a first for a non-industrial &#x2014; much less university &#x2014; building in the U.S. The utopian <a>City Beautiful movement</a> greatly influenced Bosworth's design which features the <a>Pantheon</a>-esque Great Dome, housing the Barker Engineering Library, which overlooks Killian Court, where annual Commencement exercises are held.
<p><a>Alvar Aalto</a>'s Baker House (1947), <a>Eero Saarinen</a>'s Chapel and Auditorium (1955), and <a>I.M. Pei</a>'s Green, Dreyfus, Landau, and Wiesner buildings represent high forms of post-war <a>modern architecture</a>.
More recent buildings like <a>Frank Gehry</a>'s <a>Stata Center</a> (2004), <a>Steven Holl</a>'s <a>Simmons Hall</a> (2002), <a>Charles Correa</a>'s Building 46 (2005), <a>Fumihiko Maki</a>'s Media Lab Extension (2009) are distinctive amongst the Boston area's classical architecture and serve as examples of contemporary campus &quot;starchitecture.&quot;
MIT also has five dormitories for single graduate students and two apartment buildings on campus for families.</p>
<p>MIT has a very active Greek and co-op system which includes 36 fraternities, sororities, and independent living groups (FSILGs).
50% of male undergraduates join a fraternity and 34% of women join sororities.
The board is chaired by <a>John S. Reed</a>, the former chairman of the <a>New York Stock Exchange</a> and <a>Citigroup</a>.
The sixteenth and current president, <a>Susan Hockfield</a>, a molecular neurobiologist, succeeded <a>Charles M. Vest</a>'s fourteen year tenure in December 2004 and is the first woman to hold the post.
MIT's <a>endowment</a> and <a>other financial assets</a> are managed through a subsidiary MIT Investment Management Company (MITIMCo).
It has five schools (<a>Science</a>, <a>Engineering</a>, <a>Architecture and Planning</a>, <a>Management</a>, and <a>Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences</a>) and one college (<a>Whitaker College of Health Sciences and Technology</a>), but no schools of law or medicine.
Saarinen]]'s <a>Kresge Auditorium</a> is a classic example of the <a>post-war architecture</a>]] The university historically pioneered research and training collaborations between the academy, industry and government.
Fruitful collaborations with industrialists like <a>Alfred P. Sloan</a> and <a>Thomas Alva Edison</a> led President Compton to establish an Office of Corporate Relations and an Industrial Liaison Program in the 1930s and 1940s that now allows over 600 companies to <a>license research</a> and consult with MIT faculty and researchers.
Throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, American politicians and business leaders accused MIT and other universities of contributing to a <a>declining economy</a> by <a>transferring</a> taxpayer-funded research and technology to international &#x2014; especially <a>Japanese</a> &#x2014; firms that were competing with struggling American businesses.</p>
MIT established a Washington Office in 1991 to continue to <a>lobby</a> for research funding and national <a>science policy</a>.
In response to MIT, eight <a>Ivy League</a> colleges, and 11 other institutions holding &quot;Overlap Meetings&quot; to prevent bidding wars over promising students from consuming funds for need-based scholarships, the <a>Justice Department</a> began an antitrust investigation in 1989 and in 1991 filed an <a>antitrust suit</a> against these universities.
Memorial is a monument to MIT's 4th president, [[Francis Amasa Walker]]]] MIT's proximity to <a>Harvard University</a> has created both a quasi-friendly rivalry (&quot;the other school up the <a>river</a>&quot;) and a substantial number of research collaborations such as the <a>Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology</a> and <a>Broad Institute</a>.
MIT has more modest cross-registration programs with <a>Boston University</a>, <a>Brandeis University</a>, <a>Tufts University</a>, <a>Massachusetts College of Art</a>, and the <a>School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston</a>.
MIT-<a>Zaragoza</a> International Logistics Program, and other countries through the MIT International Science and Technology Initiatives (MISTI) program.</p>
The university has been <a>accredited</a> by the <a>New England Association of Schools and Colleges</a> since 1929.
A 1995 <a>National Research Council</a> study of US research universities ranked MIT first in &quot;reputation&quot; and fourth in &quot;citations and faculty awards&quot; and a 2005 <a>NBER</a> study of high school students' <a>revealed preference</a>s found MIT to be the 4th most preferred college in the nation.</p>
Finally, all students are required to complete a swimming test and non-varsity athletes must also take four <a>physical education</a> classes.
In the first (fall) term, freshmen transcripts only report if a class was passed while no external record exists if a class was not passed.
<a>Experimental Study Group</a>, Concourse, and Terrascope.
Over 2,800 undergraduates, 70% of the student body, participate every year for academic credit, pay, or on a volunteer basis.
Students often become <a>published</a>, file <a>patent application</a>s, and/or launch <a>start-up companies</a> based upon their experience in UROPs.</p>
<p>MIT was elected to the <a>Association of American Universities</a> in 1934 and remains a research university with a very high level of research activity; The federal government was the largest source of sponsored research, with the <a>Department of Health and Human Services</a> granting $255.9 million, <a>Department of Defense</a> $97.5 million, <a>Department of Energy</a> $65.8 million, <a>National Science Foundation</a> $61.4 million, and <a>NASA</a> $27.4 million.</p>
[[GNU project]] and <a>free software movement</a> originated at MIT]] In electronics, <a>magnetic core memory</a>, <a>radar</a>, <a>single electron transistor</a>s, and <a>inertial guidance</a> controls were invented or substantially developed by MIT researchers.
<a>Claude E. Shannon</a> developed much of modern <a>information theory</a> and discovered the application of Boolean logic to <a>digital circuit</a> design theory.
In the domain of computer science, MIT faculty and researchers made fundamental contributions to <a>cybernetics</a>, <a>artificial intelligence</a>, <a>computer languages</a>, <a>machine learning</a>, <a>robotics</a>, and <a>cryptography</a>.</p>
<p>Current and previous physics faculty have won eight <a>Nobel Prizes</a>, four <a>Dirac Medals</a>, and three <a>Wolf Prize</a>s predominantly for their contributions to subatomic and quantum theory.
Members of the chemistry department have been awarded three <a>Nobel Prizes</a> and one Wolf Prize for the discovery of novel syntheses and methods.
<a>Positronium</a> atoms, synthetic <a>Penicillin</a>, <a>synthetic self-replicating molecules</a>, and the genetic bases for <a>Lou Gehrig's disease</a> and <a>Huntington's disease</a> were first discovered at MIT. <a>Jerome Lettvin</a> transformed the study of cognitive science with his paper &quot;What the frog's eye tells the frog's brain&quot;.</p>
<p>In the domain of humanities, arts, and social sciences, MIT economists have been awarded five <a>Nobel Prizes</a> and nine <a>John Bates Clark Medal</a>s.
Linguists <a>Noam Chomsky</a> and <a>Morris Halle</a> authored seminal texts on <a>generative grammar</a> and <a>phonology</a>.
The <a>MIT Media Lab</a>, founded in 1985 and known for its unconventional research, has been home to influential researchers such as <a>constructivist</a> educator and <a>Logo</a> creator <a>Seymour Papert</a>.</p>
<p>Given MIT's prominence, allegations of <a>research misconduct</a> or improprieties have received substantial press coverage.
Professor <a>David Baltimore</a>, a <a>Nobel Laureate</a>, became embroiled in a misconduct investigation starting in 1986 that led to Congressional hearings in 1991.
Professor <a>Ted Postol</a> has accused the MIT administration since 2000 of attempting to <a>whitewash</a> potential research misconduct at the Lincoln Lab facility involving a <a>ballistic missile defense</a> test, though a final investigation into the matter has not been completed.
<p>The faculty and student body highly value <a>meritocracy</a> and technical proficiency.
MIT has never awarded an <a>honorary degree</a>, nor does it award athletic scholarships, <a>ad eundem degree</a>s, or <a>Latin honors</a> upon graduation.
However, MIT has twice awarded honorary professorships; to <a>Winston Churchill</a> in 1949 and <a>Salman Rushdie</a> in 1993.</p>
&quot;[[Brass Rat]]&quot; for the Class of 2007]] Current students and alumni wear a large, heavy, distinctive <a>class ring</a> known as the &quot;<a>Brass Rat</a>&quot;.
The undergraduate ring design (a separate graduate student version exists as well) varies slightly from year to year to reflect the unique character of the MIT experience for that class, but always features a three-piece design, with the MIT seal and the class year each appearing on a separate face, flanking a large rectangular bezel bearing an image of a <a>beaver</a>.</p>
<p>  &lt;!--  Commented out: <a>thumb|200px|right|A fire truck was placed on the Great Dome by students on September 11, 2006</a> --&gt; MIT has over 380 recognized student activity groups, including a <a>campus radio station</a>, <em><a>The Tech</a></em> student newspaper, an annual <a>entrepreneurship competition</a>, and weekly screenings of popular films by the <a>Lecture Series Committee</a>.
Less traditional activities include the &quot;world's largest open-shelf <a>collection of science fiction</a>&quot; in English, a <a>model railroad club</a>, and a vibrant <a>folk dance</a> scene.
Students, faculty, and staff are involved in over 50 educational outreach and public service programs through the <a>MIT Museum</a>, Edgerton Center, and MIT Public Service Center.</p>
Some of the most popular recurring IAP activities are the 6.270, 6.370, and MasLab <a>competitions</a>, the annual <a>&quot;mystery hunt&quot;</a>, and <a>Charm School</a>.
Recent hacks have included the theft of <a>Caltech's</a> cannon, reconstructing a <a>Wright Flyer</a> atop the Great Dome, and adorning the <a>John Harvard</a> statue with the <a>Master Chief's Spartan Helmet</a>.</p>
The [[Zesiger sports and fitness center]] houses a two-story fitness center as well as swimming and diving pools]] The student athletics program offers 33 varsity-level sports, which makes it one of the largest programs in the <a>U.S.</a> MIT participates in the <a>NCAA's</a> <a>Division III</a>, the <a>New England Women's and Men's Athletic Conference</a>, the <a>New England Football Conference</a>, and <a>NCAA's</a> Division I and <a>Eastern Association of Rowing Colleges (EARC)</a> for crew.
<p><a>left|200px|thumb|Official logo of MIT Athletics</a> MIT fielded several dominant intercollegiate <a>Tiddlywinks</a> teams through 1980, winning national and world championships.
MIT has produced 128 <a>Academic All-Americans</a>, the third largest membership in the country for any division and the highest number of members for Division III.
19,446 applications were received for advanced degree program across all departments; 2,991 were admitted (15.4%) and 1,880 enrolled (62.8%).
<p>MIT has been nominally <a>coeducation</a>al since admitting <a>Ellen Swallow Richards</a> in 1870.
Richards also became the first female member of MIT's faculty, specializing in <a>sanitary chemistry</a>.
Female students remained a very small minority (less than 3 percent) prior to the completion of the first wing of a women's dormitory, <a>McCormick Hall</a>, in 1962.
In late 2001 a task force's recommended improvements in student <a>mental health</a> services were implemented, including expanding staff and operating hours at the mental health center.
<a>MIT faculty members</a> past or present have won a total of 27 <a>Nobel Prize</a>s, the majority in Economics or Physics.
Among current faculty and teaching staff, there are 80 <a>Guggenheim Fellow</a>s, 6 <a>Fulbright Scholar</a>s, and 29 <a>MacArthur Fellow</a>s.
<a>Susan Hockfield</a>, a molecular <a>neurobiologist</a>, became MIT's 16th president in 2004 and is the first woman to hold the post.</p>
The 1984 dismissal of <a>David F. Noble</a>, a historian of technology, became a <em><a>cause c&#x00e9;l&#x00e8;bre</a></em> about the extent to which academics are granted <a>freedom of speech</a> after he published several books and papers critical of MIT's and other research universities' reliance upon financial support from corporations and the military.
In 1997, the <a>Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination</a> issued a probable cause finding supporting James Jennings' allegations of racial discrimination after a senior faculty search committee in the Department of Urban Studies and Planning did not offer him reciprocal tenure.
In 2006&#x2013;2007, MIT's denial of tenure to African-American biological engineering professor <a>James Sherley</a> reignited accusations of racism in the tenure process, eventually leading to a protracted public dispute with the administration, a brief <a>hunger strike</a>, and the resignation of Professor <a>Frank L. Douglas</a> in protest.</p>
<p>MIT faculty members have often been recruited to lead other colleges and universities; former Provost <a>Robert A. Brown</a> is President of <a>Boston University</a>, former Provost <a>Mark Wrighton</a> is Chancellor of <a>Washington University in St. Louis</a>, former Associate Provost <a>Alice Gast</a> is president of <a>Lehigh University</a>, former Dean of the School of Science <a>Robert J. Birgeneau</a> is the Chancellor of the <a>University of California, Berkeley</a>, and former professor <a>David Baltimore</a> was President of <a>Caltech</a>.
In addition, faculty members have been recruited to lead governmental agencies; for example, former professor <a>Marcia McNutt</a> is the director of the <a>United States Geological Survey</a>, urban studies professor <a>Xavier de Souza Briggs</a> is currently the  associate director of the <a>White House Office of Management and Budget</a>, and biology professor <a>Eric Lander</a> is a co-chair of the <a>President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology</a>.
Seventy-six MIT alumni have <a>won the Nobel Prize</a>, forty-four have been selected as <a>Rhodes Scholar</a>s, and fifty-five have been selected as <a>Marshall Scholar</a>s.</p>
<p>Alumni in American politics and public service include <a>Chairman of the Federal Reserve</a> <a>Ben Bernanke</a>, <a>MA-1</a> Representative <a>John Olver</a>, <a>CA-13</a> Representative <a>Pete Stark</a>, former <a>National Economic Council</a> chairman <a>Lawrence H. Summers</a>, and former <a>Council of Economic Advisors</a> chairwoman <a>Christina Romer</a>.
MIT alumni in international politics include <a>British Foreign Minister</a> <a>David Miliband</a>, <a>Israeli Prime Minister</a> <a>Benjamin Netanyahu</a>, former <a>U.N.
Secretary General</a> <a>Kofi Annan</a>, and former <a>Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister</a> <a>Ahmed Chalabi</a>.</p>

We all desired cardinal red; it has stood for a thousand years on land and sea in England's emblem; it makes one-half of the stripes on America's flag; it has always stirred the heart and mind of man; it stands for 'red blood' and all that 'red blood' stands for in life.
But we were not unanimous for the gray; some wanted blue, I recall.
