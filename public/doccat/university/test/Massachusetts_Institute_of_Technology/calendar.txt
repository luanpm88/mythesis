By the end of the war, MIT employed a staff of over 4,000 (including more than a fifth of the nation's physicists) and was the nation's single largest wartime R&amp;D contractor.</p>

While the Ivy League institutions <a>settled</a>, MIT contested the charges on the grounds that the practice was not anti-competitive because it ensured the availability of aid for the greatest number of students.
Departments and their corresponding majors are numbered in the approximate order their foundation; for example, Civil and Environmental Engineering is Course I, while Nuclear Science &amp; Engineering is Course XXII.
Students majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, the most popular department, collectively identify themselves as &quot;Course VI.&quot; MIT students use a combination of the department's course number and the number assigned to the class to identify their subjects; the course which many American universities would designate as &quot;Physics 101&quot; is, at MIT, simply &quot;8.01.&quot;</p>
the freshmen retention rate at MIT are similar to other national research universities.
Some of the pressure for first-year undergraduates is lessened by the existence of the &quot;pass/no-record&quot; grading system.
In the second (spring) term, passing grades (ABC) appear on the transcript while non-passing grades are again rendered &quot;no-record&quot;.
