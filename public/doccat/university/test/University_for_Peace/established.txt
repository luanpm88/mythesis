<p> The <strong>University for Peace</strong> (<strong>UPEACE</strong>) was established in <a>Costa Rica</a> in <a>1980</a>&lt;ref name=&quot;UN_ARES3555&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;to provide humanity with an international institution of higher education for peace and with the aim of promoting among all human beings the spirit of understanding, tolerance and <a>peaceful coexistence</a>.&quot;&lt;ref
<p>At present, the UPEACE Costa Rica campus has 192 students from 55 countries, making it one of the most diverse universities in the world for its size.
<p>To ensure academic freedom, the university was established under its own Charter, approved by the <a>United Nations General Assembly</a>.
This has allowed the university to move rapidly and to innovate, focusing its new, rigorous academic programme on the fundamental causes of conflict through a multidisciplinary, multicultural-oriented approach.
<p>The wider mission of the university should be seen in the context of the worldwide peace and security objectives of the <a>United Nations</a>.
The Charter of the university calls for UPEACE &quot;to contribute to the great universal task of educating for peace by engaging in teaching, research, post-graduate training and dissemination of knowledge fundamental to the full development of the human person and societies through the interdisciplinary study of all matters related to peace&quot;.
<p>Funding of UPEACE programs comes from donor governments, foundations and institutions who believe in the mission of the university.
<p>The vision of UPEACE is to become a network of collaborating UPEACE centres and activities in different regions, guided from its headquarters in Costa Rica and cooperating with a large number of universities, NGOs and other partners on education and research for peace.
<p>In 2006, UPEACE launched its <a>UPEACE Centre for Executive Education</a>, offering short courses to non registered students, on subjects that include Nonprofit Leadership, Corporate Social Responsibility, Entrepreneurship in the Social Sector, and Educating in the 21st Century.</p>
<p>The Costa Rica campus of UPEACE sits on more than three square kilometres of beautiful land some 30 kilometers southwest&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.upeace.org/about/campus/</a>&lt;/ref&gt; of the capital, <a>San Jos&#x00e9;</a>.
The campus includes protected primary forest and a peace park, donated by the host government.<a>left|250px|thumb|Peace
After two years of academic work, these students receive an MA in International Affairs from American University's <a>School of International Service</a> and an MA in <a>Natural Resources and Sustainable Development</a> from UPEACE.</p>
<p>In addition to its Costa Rica headquarters, the UPEACE system includes offices in <a>Geneva</a> and New York City, the <a>Africa Regional Program office</a> in Addis Ababa, the Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Program office in Costa Rica.
Customised programs have also been designed and delivered for Harvard Business School's Social Enterprise Club, Arcadia University, and the University of San Diego.
<p><a>The U.S. Association for the University for Peace</a> is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization established in 2006 to advance the University for Peace and the practice of education for peace in the United States.
UPEACE/US projects include DCPEACE, an initiative to empower teachers, youth, and families with the skills and knowledge necessary to effectively serve as peacebuilders in their communities and PeaceRooms, a program that connect classrooms of middle school students from Costa Rica and Washington D.C. through the use of innovative virtual networking technology for the purpose of developing core concepts of global citizenship and peace education.<a>UPEACE/US
