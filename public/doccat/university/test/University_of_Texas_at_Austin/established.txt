<p><strong>The University of Texas at Austin</strong> (also referred to as the <strong>University of Texas</strong>, <strong>UT</strong>, <strong>UT Austin</strong>, or <strong>Texas</strong>) is a <a>public</a> <a>research university</a> located in <a>Austin</a>, <a>Texas</a>, <a>United States</a>, and is the <a>flagship</a> institution of <a>The University of Texas System</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref
Founded in 1883, the university has the <a>fifth-largest</a> single-campus enrollment in the nation as of fall 2009 (and had the largest enrollment in the country from 1997&ndash;2003), with over 50,000 undergraduate and graduate students and 16,500 faculty and staff.
It currently holds the <a>largest enrollment</a> of all colleges in the state of Texas.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The University of Texas at Austin was named one of the original eight <a>Public Ivy</a> institutions&lt;ref&gt;<em>The Public Ivies: America's Flagship Public Universities</em> (2001) by Howard and Matthew Greene&lt;/ref&gt; and was inducted into the <a>American Association of Universities</a> in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The University of Texas at Austin operates various auxiliary facilities aside from the main campus, including the <a>J.
In addition, the university was recognized by <em><a>Sports Illustrated</a></em> as &quot;America's Best Sports College&quot; in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The first mention of a public university in <a>Texas</a> can be traced to the 1827 constitution for the <a>Mexican</a> state of <a>Coahuila y Tejas</a>.
Although an article promised to establish public education in the arts and sciences, no action was taken by the Mexican government.
But after Texas obtained its <a>independence</a> from Mexico in 1836, the Congress of Texas adopted the <a>Constitution of the Republic</a>, which included a provision to establish public education in the <a>republic</a>, including two universities or colleges.
On January 26, 1839, the Congress of Texas agreed to eventually set aside fifty <a>league</a>s of land towards the effort; in addition, in the new capital of Austin were reserved and designated &quot;College Hill.&quot;&lt;ref
However, Texas's <a>secession</a> from the Union and the <a>American Civil War</a> prevented further action on these plans.

<p>After the war, the 1862 <a>Morrill Act</a> facilitated the creation of what is now <a>Texas A&amp;M University</a>, which was established in 1876 as the Agricultural &amp; Mechanical College of Texas.&lt;ref
name=&quot;TSHA&quot;/&gt; The <a>Texas Constitution of 1876</a> mandated that the state establish a university &quot;at an early day,&quot; calling for the creation of a &quot;university of the first class&quot;, styled &quot;The University of Texas.&quot;
It revoked the endowment of the railroad lands of the Act of 1858 but appropriated in West Texas.
In 1883, another two million were granted, with income from the sale of land and <a>grazing rights</a> going to The University of Texas and Texas A&amp;M.&lt;ref
<p>In 1881, Austin was chosen as the site of the main university, and Galveston was designated the location of the medical department.

Building (University of Texas at Austin)|The Tower]], completed in 1937, stands 307 ft (94 m) tall and dons <a>different colors of lighting on special occasions.</a>]]
The old <a>Victorian</a>-<a>Gothic</a> <a>Main Building</a> served as the central point of the campus's site, and was used for nearly all purposes.
But by the 1930s, discussions arose about the need for new library space, and the Main Building was razed in 1934 over the objections of many students and faculty.
The modern-day tower and Main Building were constructed in its place.</p>
A vote by the regents to move the campus to the donated land was met with outrage, and the land has only been used for auxiliary purposes such as graduate student housing.
Part of the tract was sold in the late-1990s for luxury housing, and there are controversial proposals to sell the remainder of the tract.
The <a>Brackenridge Field Laboratory</a> was established on of the land in 1967.</p>
<p>As a result of the controversy, in 1921, the legislature appropriated $1,350,000 for the purchase of land adjacent to the main campus.
But expansion was hampered by the constitutional restriction against funding the construction of buildings.
With the discovery of <a>oil</a> on university-owned grounds in 1923, the institution was able to put its new wealth towards its general endowment fund.
These savings allowed the passing of amendments to make way for bond issues in 1931 and 1947, with the latter expansion necessary from the spike in enrollment following <a>World War II</a>.
The university built 19 permanent structures between 1950 and 1965, when it was given the right of <a>eminent domain</a>.
With two rifles, a sawed-off shotgun and various other weapons, he killed 10 people on campus from the observation deck, below the clocks on the tower and three more in the tower, as well as wounding two more inside the observation deck.
Whitman had been a patient at the University Health Center, and on March 29, preceding the shootings, had conveyed to psychiatrist Maurice Heatley his feelings of overwhelming hostilities and that he was thinking about &quot;going up on the tower with a deer rifle and start shooting people.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Following the Whitman event, the observation deck was closed until 1968, and then closed again in 1975 following a series of <a>suicide</a> jumps during the 1970s.
<p>Completed in 1969, Jester Center was the largest residence hall in North America and was the largest building project in university history.
<p>The first <a>presidential library</a> on a university campus was dedicated on May 22, 1971 with former <a>President Johnson</a>, <a>Lady Bird Johnson</a> and then-President <a>Richard Nixon</a> in attendance.
<p>In August 2005, Colton Pitonyak, a junior at the university, shot and killed 21-year-old Jennifer Cave in Pitonyak&#x2019;s apartment in <a>West Campus</a>.
<p>The University of Texas has experienced a wave of new construction recently with several significant buildings.

Later the same month, after three years of renovations were completed, <a>Darrell K Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium</a> became the largest stadium (by seating capacity) in the state of Texas.
In 2009, demolition of the old Experimental Sciences Building (ESB) was completed and construction began on a replacement to be named the Norman Hackerman Building (NHB) in honor and memory of Dr. Norman Hackerman, chemist, professor and president emeritus.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>

<p>[[Image:TMM austin.JPG|left|thumb|Relief sculpture in the [[Texas Memorial Museum]]]] As a state public university, the University of Texas at Austin is subject to <a>Texas House Bill 588</a>, which guarantees graduating Texas high school seniors in the top 10% of their class admission to any public Texas university; however, students in the top 10% are not guaranteed their choice of major, and certain colleges, such as the Cockrell School of Engineering, have secondary requirements that must be met for admission.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2009, over 85% of enrolled students from Texas were admitted under this law.&lt;ref
name=&quot;http&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A new state law, Senate Bill 175, was passed by the 81st Legislature which modifies this admissions policy by limiting automatically-admitted freshmen to 75% of the entering in-state freshman class, starting in 2011.
name=&quot;2009-2010 Common Data Set&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The university's freshman retention rate in 2009 was 92.5% and the six-year graduation rate was 81.0%.&lt;ref name=&quot;2009-2010 Common Data Set&quot;/&gt; The Fall 2009 entering class had an average ACT composite score of 27 and an average SAT composite score of 1830.&lt;ref
<p> In Fall 2009, the school employed 2,770 <a>full-time</a> faculty members (88.3% of whom hold the terminal degree in their field), with a student-to-faculty ratio of 17.3 to 1.&lt;ref name=&quot;2009-2010 Common Data Set&quot;/&gt; The university's faculty includes 63 members of the National Academy,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; winners of the <a>Nobel Prize</a>, the <a>Pulitzer Prize</a>, the <a>National Medal of Science</a>, the <a>National Medal of Technology</a>, the <a>Turing Award</a> and other various awards.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
For the 2009-2010 school year, the university exceeded $640 million in research funding (up from $590 million the previous year)&lt;ref name=&quot;utexas.edu&quot;/&gt; and has earned more than 300 patents since 2003.&lt;ref
In 2009, UT Austin created nine new start-up companies to commercialize technology developed at the university and has created 46 start-ups in the past seven years.
UT Austin license agreements generated $10.9 million in revenue for the university in 2009.&lt;ref
In 2009, UT founded the Energy Institute, led by former Under Secretary for Science <a>Raymond L. Orbach</a>, to organize and advance multi-disciplinary energy research at the university.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
While the university does not have a medical school, it houses medical programs associated with other campuses and allied health professional programs, as well as major research programs in pharmacy, biomedical engineering, and neuroscience, and others.
UT Austin opened the $100 million Dell Pediatric Research Institute in 2010 as part of an effort to increase medical research at the university and establish a medical research complex, and associated medical school, in the city of Austin.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
Founded in 1946, UT's Applied Research Laboratories at the PRC has been responsible for the development or testing of the vast majority of high-frequency sonar equipment used by the Navy, and in 2007, was granted a research contract by the Navy funded up to $928 million over ten years.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p> The university has an endowment of $7.2 billion, out of the $16.11 billion (according to 2008 estimates) available to the University of Texas.
This figure reflects the fact that the school has the largest endowment of any public university in the nation.</p>
<p>[[Image:View austin campus.JPG|thumb|right|View of [[Texas State Capitol]] in downtown Austin from Main Mall, south of the <a>Main Building</a>]]</p>
<p>30% of the university's endowment comes from <a>Permanent University Fund</a> (PUF), with nearly $15 billion in assets as of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;As
required by the Texas Constitution [<a>http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/txconst/sections/cn000700-001800.html</a>], the University of Texas System gets two-thirds of the <a>Available University Fund</a>, the annual distribution of PUF income.
requires that <em>at least</em> 45 percent of this money go to the university for &quot;program enrichment.&quot;
By taking two-thirds and multiplying it by 45 percent, we get 30 percent which is the <em>minimum</em> amount of AUF income that can be distributed to the school under current policies.
Also, the majority of the University of Texas system share of the AUF is used for its debt service <a>bonds</a>, some of which were issued for the benefit of the Austin campus [<a>http://www.utsystem.edu/CONT/REPORTS/LARs/AUFLAR-102704.pdf</a>].
One should note that the Regents are free to change the 45 percent minimum of the University of Texas System share going to the Austin campus at any time, although doing so might be difficult politically.&lt;/ref&gt;
Proceeds from lands appropriated in 1839 and 1876, as well as oil monies, comprise the majority of PUF.
At one time, the PUF was the chief source of income for Texas's two university systems, The University of Texas System and the <a>Texas A&amp;M University System</a>; today, however, its revenues account for less than 10 percent of the universities' annual budgets.
