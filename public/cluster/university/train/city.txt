[[Sackville Street (Manchester)|Main Building]] from Aytoun Street / Whitworth Street]]</p>
<p>The <strong>University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology</strong> (<strong>UMIST</strong>) was a <a>university</a> based in the centre of the <a>city</a> of <a>Manchester</a> in <a>England</a>.
On 1 October 2004, it merged with the <a>Victoria University of Manchester</a> (commonly called the University of Manchester) to form a new entity also called The <a>University of Manchester</a>.
Previously its degrees were awarded by the <a>Victoria University of Manchester</a>.
<p><a>thumb|right|250px|Manchester Mechanics' Institute, Cooper Street in 1825</a></p>
<p>The foundation of UMIST can be traced to 1824 during the <a>Industrial Revolution</a> when a group of Manchester businessmen and industrialists met in a <a>public house</a>, the <em>Bridgewater Arms</em>, to establish the <em><a>Mechanics' Institute in Manchester</a></em>, where artisans could learn basic science, particularly <a>mechanics</a> and <a>chemistry</a>.&lt;ref
name=&quot;kargonmain&quot;&gt;Kargon (1977) <em>pp</em>20-24&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of such institutions  were founded in towns and cities throughout the country and while many of the fine <a>Victorian building</a>s built to house them remain, Manchester's alone survived as an independent institution serving some of its original educational aims throughout the 20th century.&lt;ref
name=&quot;hartwell&quot;&gt;Hartwell (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; By this time the institution was called the <em>Manchester Municipal School of Technology</em> or fondly known as <em>The Tech</em>.&lt;ref
name=&quot;cardwell&quot;&gt;Cardwell (1974)&lt;/ref&gt; As a project of the Manchester City Council it includes in the decoration many portrayals of the city's <a>coat of arms</a>.</p>
Similarly in the 1920s it pioneered academic training in Management, with the formation of a Department of Industrial Administration funded by an endowment from <a>asbestos</a> magnate <a>Sir Samuel Turner</a>.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Tweedale, Philip Hansen, Magic Mineral to Killer Dust: Turner &amp; Newall and the asbestos hazard, Oxford University Press, 2000, ISBN 0-19-829690-8, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; But perhaps a more significant advance was the foundation in 1905 of a <em>Faculty of Technology</em>, answerable academically to its 'younger sister' the <a>Victoria University of Manchester</a> and awarding <a>BSc</a> and <a>MSc</a> degrees, the beginnings of UMIST as a University and the first technology faculty in the country.</p>
<p>After the recent merger with <a>Victoria University of Manchester</a> the UMIST Main Building was renamed as the &quot;Sackville St. Building&quot;.</p>
<p>In 1918, the institution changed name again to <em>Manchester Municipal College of Technology</em>.
During 1955 and 1956 the Manchester College of Science and Technology achieved independent university status under its own <a>Royal Charter</a> and became separately funded from the <a>University Grants Committee</a>.</p>
<p><a>thumbnail|The UMIST emblem as used in the late 20th century (based on the arms of the Institute, derived from the coat of arms of the lords of the manor of Manchester)</a></p>
It overlooks Melbourne's historic <a>Flinders Street Station</a>, the <a>Yarra River</a> and the Southbank precinct.
<p><a>|thumb|left|200px|Victoria University City Campus in Queens Street</a> The City Queen Campus occupies two heritage buildings in the heart of Melbourne's legal precinct.
<p>By 1966 all non-degree courses were moved to the <a>Manchester Polytechnic</a> which is now known as <a>Manchester Metropolitan University</a>, and in 1966 the name finally changed to the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology on the initiative of Acting Principal <a>Frank Morton</a>.&lt;ref name=TCE&gt;<em>The Chemical Engineer</em> 11 March 1999, page 30 &quot;Frank Morton&quot; (obituary)&lt;/ref&gt; UMIST and the <a>Victoria University of Manchester</a> retained close ties for the second half of the 20th century, with UMIST students being awarded, or having the choice of, a University of Manchester degree until full autonomy in 1993.</p>
<p>UMIST was the Faculty of Technology of the Victoria University of Manchester, an interesting situation because the University of Manchester held its own science and engineering courses.
<p>Congregation ceremonies were held at the University of Manchester on Oxford Road, but in 1991 the first congregation ceremony was held in the Great Hall at UMIST itself in the Sackville Street Building.</p>
<p>Students of UMIST were actually students of both UMIST and the Victoria University with graduation certificates stating the university issuing the degree as &quot;The Victoria University of Manchester&quot;.
<p>UMIST students were entitled to use the facilities of Manchester University, including the <a>John Rylands University Library</a> at the Oxford Road site and sports facilities and social clubs organised by the students' unions.
In fact, first year UMIST undergraduates were often placed into Manchester University halls of residence.</p>
The tradition continues in The University of Manchester [<a>http://www.bogle.org.uk</a>]</p>
<p>UMIST was instrumental in the founding of  what is now the  <a>Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester</a>.
<p>UMIST, together with the <a>Victoria University of Manchester</a> ceased to exist on 1 October 2004, when they were combined in a new single <a>University of Manchester</a> hoping to combine the strengths and traditions of both.</p>
No plans have been announced for the sale of any former Victoria University of Manchester buildings.
<p>In the estates strategy for 2010-2020 for the University of Manchester [<a>http://documents.manchester.ac.uk/display.aspx?DocID=8186</a>] it is stated that essentially all of the former UMIST campus, described as the &quot;area north of the Mancunian Way,&quot; is to be disposed of.
<p>Until the late 1980s, UMIST's official alumni organisation was called the Manchester Technology Association, a name which was a relic of UMIST's past incarnation as 'The Tech'.
<p>In 2004, at the time of the university merger, the UMIST Association also merged with its equivalent organisation at the Victoria University of Manchester.

<p>UMIST moved to its present location just south of <a>Manchester</a> city centre at the end of the 19th century.
The new edifices were designed by leading <a>Manchester</a> architects and were all built out of concrete.

<p>Victoria University emphasises research and research training that is of relevance to the community,industry and government &#x2013; both nationally and internationally, but particularly in the western region of Melbourne.
<p>Victoria University campuses are located across Melbourne's western suburbs and the city centre.
<p>City Flinders is located across two buildings at 300 Flinders Street and 301 Flinders Lane in central <a>Melbourne.</a>

}} <strong>Odense University</strong>, now <strong>Syddansk Universitet Odense</strong> (or <strong>SDU Odense</strong> in abbreviated form), has been part of the <a>University of Southern Denmark</a> since 1998 of which it forms the biggest campus.
It is the university of <a>Odense</a>, <a>Denmark</a>'s third largest city, and the island of <a>Funen</a>.
Approximately 800 researchers and 12,000 students (counting both <a>undergraduate</a>s and <a>postgraduate</a>s) are enrolled at SDU Odense.
<p>Being an epitome of <a>Danish functionalist architecture</a>, SDU Odense has been <a>nickname</a>d <em>Rustenborg</em> (which roughly translates as <em>The Rusty Castle</em>) by students and staff, because it is built from gray concrete slabs covered with oxidized metal plates.
<p>SDU Odense is considered the main campus of the <a>University of Southern Denmark</a>, both because of its relative size and because the central administration of the university is situated there.
Odense is also by far the biggest campus of the SDU - both in terms of physical size and the number of students, staff, departments and degrees.</p>
