For <a>football</a>, the Aggies compete in Division I <a>FCS</a> (formerly known as Division I-AA), and are members of the <a>Great West Conference</a>, granting UC Davis the distinction of being one of only three UC campuses to field a football team (<a>Cal</a> and <a>UCLA</a> being the other two).
The Aggies are also members of the <a>Mountain Pacific Sports Federation</a> in gymnastics and lacrosse, the <a>Western Intercollegiate Rowing Association</a> in <a>rowing</a>, and an associate member of the <a>Pacific-10 Conference</a> in wrestling.</p>
<p>The Aggies finished first in <a>NCAA</a> <a>Division II</a> six times in 2003 and won the <a>NACDA Directors' Cup</a> 4 years in a row from 1999 to 2003.
<p>Kalamazoo College is a member of the <a>Great Lakes Colleges Association</a>.
In 2010, <a>Forbes</a> rated it 73rd of <a>America's Best Colleges</a>.,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the highest ranked in the State of Michigan.</p>
<p>Kalamazoo College was founded in 1833 by a group of Baptist ministers as the Michigan and Huron Institute.
In 1837, the name of the fledgling college was changed to the &quot;Kalamazoo Literary Institute&quot; and school officials made their first attempt to secure recognition as a college from the state of <a>Michigan</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1838, however, the <a>University of Michigan</a> opened the Kalamazoo Branch of the University of Michigan, providing a local competitor to the Literary Institute.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1840, the two schools merged, and from 1840 to 1850 the College operated as the Kalamazoo Branch of the University of Michigan.&lt;ref

<p><strong>Jadavpur University</strong> (<strong>JU</strong>) () is an educational and research institution in <a>India</a>.
<p>The <a>University Grants Commission</a> has identified JU as one of the first five universities in the country with &quot;Potential for Excellence&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
JU was also nominated as the lead institution for TEQIP, a <a>World Bank</a> funded program in India.</p>
<p><a>thumb|Golden Jubilee logo of Jadavpur University</a> The National Council of Education (NCE) was set up in 1906 to impart literary, scientific and technical education on a national basis.
The year was significant in Bengal's history as the province had just been partitioned by <a>Lord Curzon</a>, the <a>Governor-General of India</a>, into East Bengal on the one hand (the area that was eventually to become <a>Bangladesh</a> in 1971) and West Bengal and <a>Orissa</a> on the other.
<p>Almost on the same day a rival organisation, the Society for Promotion of Technical Education in Bengal, was set up by <a>Taraknath Palit</a>,&lt;ref&gt;Haridas Mukherjee and Uma Mukherjee, <em>The Origins of the National Education Movement</em> (Calcutta: National Council of Education, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; and under it the Bengal Technical Institute came into being on July 25, 1906.
As sthe university celebrated its Golden Jubilee on December 24, 2005, a special emblem (see above) was created to commemorate the occasion, and the motto 'To Know is to Grow' was coined.
<p>Admission to JU is competitive, especially for the engineering courses.

These and other achievements motivated a decision (following a year of heavy discussion by campus administrators, faculty, staff, students, alumni and the local community) in 2003 for the athletics program to re-classify to Division I.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; <a>thumb|Aggies at Stanford (half-time show), September 17, 2005</a> The highlight of the recent 4-year transition to Division I occurred on September 17, 2005, when the Aggies defeated the heavily favored <a>Stanford</a> Cardinal at <a>Stanford Stadium</a> by a score of 20-17 on a TD pass with 8 seconds left in the game.
The Aggies also pulled off an upset against Stanford in basketball just months later, beating the Cardinal 64-58 with a late rally at home on December 4, 2005.
The win in these two major sports and the addition of the Aggies beating the Cardinal in soccer earlier in 2005 as well as a win in wrestling and two wins in baseball pulled the Aggies' win loss record with Stanford to 5-1 for men's sports the 05-06 year.</p>
Students at UC Davis are referred to as Aggies in honor of the school's agricultural heritage.

Hicks conceived of the &quot;K Plan&quot; program under which most Kalamazoo students spend at least one term abroad and spend at least one term working in an academic internship.
As part of the original &quot;K Plan,&quot; Kalamazoo College students could attend school year-round.

<h3>Men's basketball</h3>
<h4>Basketball dispute</h4>
<p>In 2001, the Kalamazoo College men's basketball team was at the center of a lengthy dispute regarding the outcome of a January 20 game with league rival <a>Olivet College</a>.
With Olivet leading 70-69, Kalamazoo College center Kevin Baird made a shot at the buzzer that was initially waved off by referees.
The referees reviewed videotape of the game and determined that Baird had, in fact, released his shot before the buzzer and then awarded Kalamazoo College a 71-70 victory.
Kalamazoo then filed a protest with the NCAA, claiming that Olivet's protest was in violation of NCAA bylaws.
On February 1, the NCAA upheld Kalamazoo's counter-protest and again awarded the game to the Hornets.
The dispute between Olivet and Kalamazoo received national attention and Baird's shot was shown repeatedly on <a>ESPN</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The words to the college fight-song, &quot;All Hail to Kazoo,&quot; were written by A.G. Walton (1911) with music by D.R. Belcher (1909), arranged by Burton Edward Fischer.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>

<p>Kaleidoscope (formerly known as the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, and Ally Student Organization, GLBTSO) hosts the Crystal Ball each spring.
A long-standing tradition at K College, this event was created to educate the campus about GLBT issues and celebrate the persons who make up the GLBT community.
While it was originally instituted (despite the Student Commission's rejection) as a day for students to relax and have fun, the <a>1980 Kalamazoo tornado</a> prompted students to spend that year's DOGL helping clean up after the storm and giving back to their community.
The date is determined by the president of the Student Commission and kept secret from the student body, though it is usually on one of the Wednesdays during weeks 7-9.
