<p>At present, the UPEACE Costa Rica campus has 192 students from 55 countries, making it one of the most diverse universities in the world for its size.
<p>The vision of UPEACE is to become a network of collaborating UPEACE centres and activities in different regions, guided from its headquarters in Costa Rica and cooperating with a large number of universities, NGOs and other partners on education and research for peace.
UPEACE is in the process of seeking accreditation through the Costa Rican official body SINAES.
<p>The Costa Rica campus of UPEACE sits on more than three square kilometres of beautiful land some 30 kilometers southwest&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.upeace.org/about/campus/</a>&lt;/ref&gt; of the capital, <a>San Jos&#x00e9;</a>.
<p>UPEACE has eight one-year masters program at its Costa Rica campus: <a>International Law and Human Rights</a>, <a>International Law and the Settlement of Disputes</a>, <a>Gender and Peace Building</a>, <a>International Peace Studies</a>, <a>Peace Education</a>, <a>Environmental Security and Peace</a>, and <a>Media, Peace and Conflict</a>.
<p>In addition to its Costa Rica headquarters, the UPEACE system includes offices in <a>Geneva</a> and New York City, the <a>Africa Regional Program office</a> in Addis Ababa, the Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Program office in Costa Rica.
<p>The university's <a>Centre for Executive Education</a>, is offering short courses to professional audiences who come to Costa Rica for an intensive week.
UPEACE/US projects include DCPEACE, an initiative to empower teachers, youth, and families with the skills and knowledge necessary to effectively serve as peacebuilders in their communities and PeaceRooms, a program that connect classrooms of middle school students from Costa Rica and Washington D.C. through the use of innovative virtual networking technology for the purpose of developing core concepts of global citizenship and peace education.<a>UPEACE/US
<p>The UPEACE Sharing Knowledge for Peace Program (SKP) is a distance learning initiative which ensures that those unable to attend courses in Costa Rica or in one of the other UPEACE locations are reached through state-of-the-art dissemination methods.<a>right|250px|thumb|View
