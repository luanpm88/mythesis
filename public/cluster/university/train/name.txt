The original campus was a single academic building that was later named [[University Hall (Brown University)|University Hall]].]]</p>
<p>In 1764, Edwards joined several others as an original fellow or trustee for the chartering of the College in the English Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations (the former name for Brown University), the first Baptist college in the original <a>thirteen colonies</a> and one of the <a>Ivy League</a> universities.[<a>http://www.brown.edu/Administration/Corporation/downloads/charter-of-brown-university.pdf</a>]</p>
In 1804, a year after John Brown's death, the University was renamed Brown University in honor of John's nephew, <a>Nicholas Brown, Jr.</a>, who was a member of the class of 1786 and in 1804 contributed $5,000 toward an endowed professorship.
<p>Brown began to admit women when it established a <a>Women's College in Brown University</a> in 1891, which was later named <a>Pembroke College in Brown University</a>.
<p>The language of the Brown University charter has long been interpreted by the university as discouraging the founding of a <a>business school</a> or <a>law school</a>.
Prior to the march, Brown University served as an encampment site for French troops, and the College Edifice, now University Hall, was turned into a military hospital.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
The <a>curriculum</a> was the result of a paper written by <a>Ira Magaziner</a> and Elliot Maxwell entitled &quot;Draft of a Working Paper for Education at Brown University.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

<p> [[Image:BrownScienceLibrary1.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Sciences Library (Brown University)|Science Library]]]] The University's medical program started in 1811, but the school was suspended by President Wayland in 1827 after the program's faculty declined to live on campus (a new requirement under Wayland).
In 1991, the school was officially renamed the Brown University School of Medicine, then renamed once more to Brown Medical School in October 2000.&lt;ref&gt;<a>History of the Brown Medical School</a>&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2007, self-made entrepreneur Warren Alpert donated $100 million to Brown Medical School on behalf of the Warren Alpert Foundation, tying <a>Sidney Frank</a> for the largest single monetary contribution ever made to the University.
In recognition of the gift, the faculty of Brown University approved changing the name of the Brown Medical School to The Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University.
Since 2005, the MBL and Brown University have collaborated in a Ph.D.-awarding Graduate Program in Biological and Environmental Sciences, which brings together faculty from both institutions.

Drexel University was founded in 1891 as the Drexel Institute of Art, Science and Industry by Philadelphia financier and philanthropist <a>Anthony J. Drexel</a> to provide educational opportunities in the &#x201c;practical arts and sciences&#x201d; for women and men of all backgrounds.
Drexel became the Drexel Institute of Technology in 1936, and in 1970 Drexel Institute of Technology gained university status, becoming Drexel University.
On July 1, 2002, Drexel was officially united with the former MCP Hahnemann University, creating the Drexel University College of Medicine; and in the fall of 2006, Drexel established its School of Law.
In June 2009, the president of Drexel University, <a>Constantine Papadakis</a>, died of lung cancer.

<p><a>thumb|left|First Students at Macquarie University</a>The idea of founding a third university in Sydney was flagged in the early 1960s when the <a>New South Wales Government</a> formed a committee of enquiry into higher education to deal with a perceived emergency in university enrolments in <a>New South Wales</a>.
<p>Macquarie University was formally established in 1964 with the passage of the Macquarie University Act 1964 by the New South Wales parliament.
The fledgling Macquarie University Council decided that planning for the campus would be done within the university, rather than by consultants, and this led to the establishment of the architect-planners office.&lt;ref
In their book <em>Liberality of Opportunity</em>, Bruce Mansfield and Mark Hutchinson describe the founding of Macquarie University as &#x2018;an act of faith and a great experiment&#x2019;.&lt;ref&gt;Liberality of Opportunity, Mansfield and Hutchinson, p. 317&lt;/ref&gt; An additional topic considered in this book is the <a>science reform movement</a> of the late 1970s that resulted in the introduction of a named science degree, thus facilitating the subsequent inclusion of other named degrees in addition to the traditional BA.&lt;ref&gt;Liberality of Opportunity, Mansfield and Hutchinson, pp.
The first Vice-Chancellor of Macquarie University was Alexander George Mitchell, who held the position until December 1975, when he was replaced by Edwin Webb, who served until 1986.

<p>During 2007, Macquarie University faced a restructuring of its student organisation after an audit raised questions about management of hundreds of thousands of dollars in funds by student organisations&lt;ref name=&quot;audit&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; At the centre of the investigation was Victor Ma, president of the Macquarie University Students' Council, who had previously been involved in a high-profile case of student election fixing at the <a>University of Sydney</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The Federal Court ordered on 23 May 2007 that Macquarie University Union Ltd be wound up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = <a>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/federal_ct/2007/844.html</a>

<p>Following the dissolution of Macquarie University Union Ltd, the outgoing student organisation was replaced with a new wholly owned subsidiary company of the university, known as U@MQ Ltd.
The new student organisation originally lacked a true student representative union; however, following a complete review and authorisation from the university Council, a new student union known as Macquarie University Students Association (MUSRA) was established in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://www.uatmq.com.au/umqwr/_assets/main/lib90019/musra%20charter_final_24jun09.pdf</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>

<p><strong>Purdue University</strong>, located in <a>West Lafayette</a>, <a>Indiana</a>, <a>U.S.</a>, is the <a>flagship university</a> of the six-campus <a>Purdue University System</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Purdue established the first <a>college credit</a> offered in <a>flight training</a>, the first four-year <a>bachelor's degree</a> in <a>aviation</a>, and the first university <a>airport</a> (<a>Purdue University Airport</a>).
On May 6, 1869, it was decided that the college would be founded near the city of <a>Lafayette</a> and legislators established the institution as Purdue University, in the name of the institution&#x2019;s principal benefactor.&lt;ref
<p>Purdue University is well known for its diverse majors in <a>aerospace</a>.
The <a>Purdue University Airport</a> was the first university-owned airport in the United States.
<p>In 2010, Purdue University received a $1.35 million grant from the <a>United States Air Force</a> to develop alternative fuels and test aircraft engines at a new facility.
<p>In 1930 Purdue became the first university in the country to offer college credit for flight training, and later became the first university to open its own airport, the <a>Purdue University Airport</a>.
<p>At one point, Purdue University owned and operated a <a>charter airline</a> operation under <a>FAR</a> part 121 simply called &quot;Purdue Airlines&quot;.
In fact, <a>Hugh Hefner</a>'s famous <a>Playboy</a> <a>DC-9</a> aircraft was leased from Purdue, and its permanent storage was at Purdue University.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>[[File:Purdue Engineering Fountain, angle.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Engineering Fountain]] at Purdue]] The Purdue Mall is the central quad of Purdue University.
Also near the Purdue Mall is Felix Haas Hall, which was constructed in 1909 as Memorial Gymnasium in memory of the 17 Purdue University football players, coaches, alumni, and fans who perished in the <a>Purdue Wreck</a> railroad accident on October 31, 1903.

According to an article in the college's alumni magazine, &quot;because of the decisive support expressed by Reed's faculty, students, and alumni for the three besieged teachers and for the principle of academic freedom, Reed College's experience with McCarthyism stands apart from that of most other American colleges and universities.

In 1878, when Justice Serranus Clinton Hastings gave $100,000 to the University of California to start the law school bearing his name, he imposed two conditions: (1) the school must remain in San Francisco near the courts and (2) it could not be governed by the <a>Regents of the University of California</a>.
See: <a>University of California, Hastings College of the Law#History</a>.
<p>The University of California's campuses boast large numbers of distinguished <a>faculty</a> in almost every field and is widely regarded as one of the top public university systems in the world.

<p><strong>The University of Sydney</strong> (informally <strong>Sydney University</strong> or <strong>USyd</strong>) is a university located in <a>Sydney</a>, <a>Australia</a>.
<p>The University of Sydney is a member of Australia's <a>Group of Eight</a>, Academic Consortium 21, the <a>Association of Pacific Rim Universities</a> (APRU) and the <a>Worldwide Universities Network</a>.</p>
<p>The university was established via the passage of the University of Sydney Act,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; which was signed on 1 October 1850.
On 27 February 1858 the university received its <a>Royal Charter</a> from <a>Queen Victoria</a>, giving degrees conferred by the university rank and recognition equal to those given by universities in the UK.&lt;ref name=&quot;royal_charter&quot;&gt;<a>Royal Charter of the University of Sydney</a>&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1859, the university had moved to its current site in the Sydney suburb of <a>Camperdown</a>.</p>
<p>The New England University College was founded as part of the University of Sydney in 1938, and separated to become the University of New England in 1954.</p>
<p>During the late 1960s, the University of Sydney was at the centre of rows to introduce courses on <a>Marxism</a> and <a>feminism</a> at the major Australian universities.
<p><a>thumb|250px|Front lawns</a> The <a>Orange Agricultural College</a> (OAC) was originally transferred to the <a>University of New England</a> under the Act, but then transferred to the University of Sydney in 1994, as part of the reforms to the University of New England undertaken by the University of New England Act 1993&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and the Southern Cross University Act 1993.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
In January 2005, the University of Sydney transferred the OAC to <a>Charles Sturt University</a>.</p>
<p>In 2010, the <a>Times Higher Education World University Rankings</a> placed the University of Sydney 184st in the world and 3rd in Australia behind the <a>University of Melbourne</a> (36th) and the Macquarie University (43rd).&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p><a>QS World University Rankings</a> 2010 placed the University of Sydney 48th in the world and 2nd in Australia ahead of the University of Melbourne (38th).&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The University of Sydney currently has financial endowments totaling $829 million.
<p>Latest figures show that the University of Sydney has received the highest amount of research grants, which may demonstrate its research competitiveness and the size of its students and staff body.&lt;ref
name=&quot;usyd_facts&quot;/&gt; The University of Sydney also has the second largest (behind <a>Monash University</a>) body of students and researchers among Australian universities.</p>
<p>The University of Sydney secured more than $46 million in funding in the 2007 round of National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Project Grant, Capacity Building and Fellowship awards, the largest allocation to any university in the state.

<p>In 2010 <a>QS World University Rankings</a>&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; ranked the University of Canterbury 189th overall in the world, making it the third highest ranked university in New Zealand.
<p>The <a>University of Canterbury Students' Association</a> (UCSA)&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; operates on campus with its own radio station (<a>RDU</a>) and magazine (<a><em>Canta</em></a>).
The most prominent of these include the <a>University of Canterbury Engineering Society (ENSOC)</a>, the Law Society (LAWSOC), the Commerce Society (UCom), as well as the largest non-faculty clubs such as BYCSOC (Backyard Cricket Society), CUBA (<a>Canterbury University Boardriders' Association</a>), CurrySoc, <a>The Gentlemen's Club</a>, and <a>KAOS</a> (Killing As Organised Sport).
The <a>University of Canterbury Drama Society</a> (Dramasoc) achieved fame for its 1942-1969 Shakespeare productions under Dame <a>Ngaio Marsh</a>, but regularly performs as an active student- and alumni-run arts fixture in the small Christchurch theatre-scene.

In 1957 the name changed again to the present <em>University of Canterbury</em>.</p>
That year saw the dissolution of the federal system of tertiary education in New Zealand, and the University of Canterbury became an independent University awarding its own degrees.
Upon the UNZ's demise, <a>Canterbury Agricultural College</a> became a constituent college of the University of Canterbury, as <em>Lincoln College</em>.&lt;ref&gt;[<a>http://www.lincoln.ac.nz/story_images/952_LincolnUniversity_s3422.pdf</a> &lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln College became independent in 1990 as a full university in its own right.</p>
<p>With the dissolution of the University of New Zealand, the newly independent University of Canterbury devised its own coat of arms, <a>blazoned</a>: :<em>&quot;murrey a fleece argent, in base a plough or, and on a chief wavy or an open book proper bound murrey, edged and clasped or between a pall azure charged with four crosses formy fitchy or and a cross flory azure.&quot;</em>

<p><strong>Hiram College</strong> ( ) is a private <a>liberal arts college</a> located in <a>Hiram, Ohio</a>.
Founded by Amos Sutton Hayden of the <a>Disciples of Christ</a> Church in 1850, the institution has, since its first days, been nonsectarian and coeducational, and throughout its existence Hiram College has sustained this egalitarian tradition of educating men and women from diverse backgrounds.
Hiram College is accredited by <a>The Higher Learning Commission</a> of the <a>North Central Association of Colleges and Schools</a>.
The school attained collegiate rank in 1867 and changed its name to Hiram College.&lt;ref
<p>Three years after the Institute attained collegiate rank and became known as Hiram College, Burke A. Hinsdale, who had been a student of Garfield's, was appointed president.
Because of the fairly brief terms of the two presidents who preceded him, Hinsdale is known as the first permanent president of Hiram College.
<p>In September 2004, <a>Thomas V. Chema</a> was appointed as the 21st president of Hiram College.</p>

<p>The <strong>University of Vienna</strong> () is a <a>public university</a> located in <a>Vienna</a>, <a>Austria</a>.
In 2010, according to University Ranking by Academic Performance (URAP),&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; University of Vienna is the best university in Austria and 158th university in the world.</p>
<p><a>thumb|240px|left|University of Vienna, main building, seen from across the Ringstra&#x00df;e</a> The University was founded on March 12, 1365 by <a>Rudolf IV, Duke of Austria</a> and his two brothers, <a>Albert III, Duke of Austria</a> and <a>Leopold III, Duke of Austria</a>, hence the additional name &#x201c;Alma Mater Rudolphina&#x201d;.
After the <a>Charles University</a> in <a>Prague</a> and <a>Jagiellonian University</a> in <a>Krakow</a>, the University of Vienna is the third oldest university in <a>Central Europe</a> and the oldest university in the German-speaking world.</p>
Approval was finally received from the Pope in 1384 and the University of Vienna was granted the status of a full university, including the Faculty of Catholic Theology.
<p>Following the <a>Anschluss</a>, the annexation of Austria into Greater Germany by the Nazi regime, in 1938 the University of Vienna was reformed under political aspects and a huge number of teachers and students were dismissed for political and &quot;racial&quot; reasons.&lt;ref&gt;<a>http://gedenkbuch.univie.ac.at/index.php?L=2</a> Memorial Book for the Victims of National Socialism at the University of Vienna in 1938&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p><a>thumb|240px|Main Ceremonial Chamber (<em>Gro&#x00df;er Festsaal</em>) in the Main Building</a> The academic facilities of the University of Vienna occupy more than sixty locations throughout the city of Vienna.
The nearby <a>Campus of the University of Vienna</a> forms an additional, more spacious, focus of the University.
<p>The University of Vienna was placed 85th in the <a>Times Higher Education's</a> World University Rankings in 2007, rising from 87th place in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
<p>The University of Vienna, like all universities and academies in Austria, once featured a system of democratic representation.
The reforms also separated the medical departments into separate medical schools, such as the <a>Medical University of Vienna</a>.</p>
<p><a>Nobel Prize</a> Laureates who taught at the University of Vienna include <a>Robert B&#x00e1;r&#x00e1;ny</a>, <a>Julius Wagner-Jauregg</a>, <a>Hans Fischer</a>, <a>Karl Landsteiner</a>, <a>Erwin Schr&#x00f6;dinger</a>, <a>Victor Franz Hess</a>, <a>Otto Loewi</a>, <a>Konrad Lorenz</a> and <a>Friedrich Hayek</a>.</p>
<p>The University of Vienna was the cradle of the <a>Austrian School</a> of economics.

<p>The <strong>California State University</strong> (<strong>CSU</strong>) is a <a>public university</a> <a>system</a> in the <a>state</a> of <a>California</a>.
It is incorporated as <strong>The Trustees of the California State University</strong>.
The California State University system headquarters are at 401 Golden Shore in <a>downtown Long Beach</a>.&lt;ref&gt;<a>Home
<em>California State University</em>.
<p>Today's California State University system is the direct descendant of the <a>California State Normal School</a> (now <a>San Jose State University</a>), a <a>normal school</a> established by the California Legislature on May 2, 1862.
<p>In 1972 the system became The California State University and Colleges, and all of the campuses were renamed with the words &quot;California State University&quot; in their names.
Former San Diego State University student body president Calvin Robinson wrote the bill, signed into law by Ronald Reagan, that allowed every California State University the option to revert the schools back to their pre-1972 names: San Jose State, San Diego State, San Francisco State, etc.
<p><a>thumb|right|250px|Office of the Chancellor in Long Beach</a> The governance structure of the California State University is largely determined by state law.
The California State University is ultimately administered by the 25 member <a>Board of Trustees of the California State University</a>.
The Trustees appoint the <a>Chancellor of the California State University</a>, who is the <a>chief executive officer</a> of the system, and the Presidents of each campus, who are the chief executive officers of their respective campuses.</p>
<p>The <a>Academic Senate of the California State University</a>, made up of elected representatives of the faculty from each campus, recommends academic policy to the Board of Trustees through the Chancellor.</p>
<p>The California State University is administered by the 25 member Board of Trustees (BOT).
  <li>two students from the California State University appointed by the Governor</li>
  <li>a representative of the alumni associations of the state university selected for a two-year term by the alumni council of the California State University</li>
The delegation of authority from the BOT to the Chancellor has historically been controlled by a BOT resolution titled &quot;Statement of General Principles in the Delegation of Authority and Responsibility&quot; of August 4, 1961, and is now controlled by the Standing Orders of the Board of Trustees of the California State University.
<p>The California State University's permanent, collective endowment has grown to $874 million U.S. dollars as of the close of the 2006-2007 academic year.&lt;ref&gt;<a>2006-2007

Unlike the typical university extension courses, they are degree-granting and students have the same status as other California State University students.
The newest campus, the California State University, Channel Islands, was formerly an off campus branch of CSUN.
Riverside and Contra Costa counties, which have 3 million residents between them, have lobbied for their off campus branches to be freestanding California State University campuses.

As a result of recent legislation (SB 724 and AB 2382), the California State University may now offer the <a>Ed.D</a> (also known as the <a>Doctor of Education</a> or &quot;education doctorate degree&quot;) and <a>DPT</a> (Doctor of Physical Therapy) degrees to its graduate students.
Additionally, the California State University (CSU) offers Ph.D degrees and some professional doctorates (for instance, audiology, Au.D) as a &quot;joint degree&quot; in combination with other institutions of higher education, including &quot;joint degrees&quot; with the <a>University of California (UC)</a> and accredited private universities.

<p>The <strong>United States Naval Academy</strong> (also known as <strong>USNA</strong>, <strong>Annapolis</strong>, or <strong>Navy</strong>) is a four-year <a>coeducational</a> <a>federal service academy</a> located in <a>Annapolis</a>, <a>Maryland</a>, United States.

The decision to establish an academy on land may have been in part a result of the <a>Somers</a> Affair, an alleged mutiny involving the Secretary of War's son that resulted in his execution at sea. <a>Commodore</a> <a>Matthew Perry</a> had a considerable interest in naval education, supporting an apprentice system to train new seamen, and helped establish the curriculum for the United States Naval Academy.
