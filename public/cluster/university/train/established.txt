Founded in 1889, Barnard has been affiliated with Columbia since 1900.&lt;ref
The college was named after <a>Frederick Augustus Porter Barnard</a>, an American educator and mathematician, who served as the president of the then-<a>Columbia College</a> from 1864 to 1889.
<p>Barnard's original 1889 home was a rented <a>brownstone</a> at 343 Madison Avenue, where a faculty of six offered instruction to 14 students in the School of Arts, as well as to 22 &quot;specials&quot;, who lacked the entrance requirements in Greek and so enrolled in science.
It also houses an archival collection of official and student publications, photographs, letters and other material that documents Barnard&#x2019;s history from its founding in 1889 to the present day.

<p>On June 20, 1964, U.S. President <a>Lyndon B. Johnson</a> dedicated UC Irvine before a crowd of 15,000 people, and on October 4, 1965 the campus began operations with 1,589 students, 241 staff members, 119 faculty, and 43 teaching assistants.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
