<p>In 1902, New York newspaper magnate <a>Joseph Pulitzer</a> donated a substantial sum to the university for the founding of a school to teach journalism.
<p>The <em><a>Columbia Daily Spectator</a></em> is the nation's second-oldest student newspaper;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and <em><a>The Blue and White</a></em>,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; a monthly literary magazine established in 1890, has recently begun to delve into campus life and local politics in print and on its daily blog, dubbed the <em>Bwog</em>.</p>
<p><em><a>The Fed</a></em>&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; a triweekly satire and investigative newspaper; and the <em><a>Jester of Columbia</a></em>,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the newly (and frequently) revived campus humor magazine both inject humor into local life.</p>
During the spring semester, graduate students in the Journalism School publish <em><a>The Bronx Beat</a></em>, a bi-weekly newspaper covering the South Bronx.
It is both a watchdog and a friend of the press in all its forms, from newspapers to magazines to radio, television, and the Web.

<p>The school's independent student newspaper is <em><a>The Daily Orange</a></em>, founded in 1903 and independent since 1971.
<p>South Campus is the site for the athletic programs, including major sports facilities such as <a>Michigan Stadium</a>, <a>Crisler Arena</a>, and <a>Yost Ice Arena</a>.
The University of Michigan Golf Course was included in a listing of top holes designed by what <em><a>Sports Illustrated</a></em> calls &#x201c;golf&#x2019;s greatest course architect.&#x201d;
<a>Intramural sports</a> are popular, and there are recreation facilities for each of the three campuses.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p> [[File:MichiganStadium2010UConn.JPG|thumb|A football game at [[Michigan Stadium]]|alt=Crowded stadium with yellow-colored &quot;Michigan&quot; written on a green field]] The University of Michigan's sports teams are called the <a>Wolverines</a>.
They participate in the <a>NCAA's</a> Football Bowl Subdivision (formally <a>Division I-A</a>) and in the <a>Big Ten Conference</a> in all sports except men's <a>ice hockey</a>, which is a member of the <a>Central Collegiate Hockey Association</a>, and woman's water polo, which is a member of the Collegiate Water Polo Association.
In 10 of the past 14 years concluding in 2009, U-M has finished in the top five of the <a>NACDA Director's Cup</a>, a ranking compiled by the <a>National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics</a> to tabulate the success of universities in competitive sports.
U-M has fierce rivalries with many teams, including <a>Michigan State</a>, <a>Notre Dame</a>, and <a>Ohio State</a>, the last of which has been referred to by <a>ESPN</a> as the <a>greatest rivalry</a> in American sports.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
<p>U-M athletes have starred in Major League Baseball, the <a>National Football League</a> and <a>National Basketball Association</a> as well as other professional sports.

professor and future <a>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> founder <a>William Barton Rogers</a> wrote, &quot;[T]he legislators of the University have, we think, wisely made their highest academic honor&mdash;that of Master of Arts of the University of Virginia&mdash;the genuine test of diligent and successful literary training, and, disdaining such literary almsgiving, have firmly barred the door against the demands of spurious merit and noisy popularity.&quot;
founder, William Barton Rogers, regarded the practice of giving honorary degrees as 'literary almsgiving ... of spurious merit and noisy popularity....' Rogers was a geologist from the University of Virginia who believed in Thomas Jefferson's policy barring honorary degrees at the university, which was founded in 1819.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref
